#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,More men than I bargained for...wasn't hoping for more than one, out of sheer curiosity.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=angry,All men?  I'm not afraid of you.  Keep your sword ready, Jura.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=bored,The three men on our ship are enough for me.  And <i>they</i> don't try to get us naked, or strip themselves.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=bored,Well, Jura, plenty of men's tubes to go around.  Ready to collect that seed you want so badly?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=unimpressed,I would've liked to meet an Earth woman here.  But no, of course not.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,Earth women would have been alien enough.  You didn't arrange this on purpose, did you, Jura?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:5-5=annoyed,...<i>No</i>.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:5-5=bored,If you tell me to leave, D.Va, then yes, I'll do that.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:5-5=annoyed,What are you, some kind of sex pervert?  I'm not taking side bets.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=disappointed,Of course women can do what they want with their bodies.  Doesn't mean I have to respect them for it.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=disappointed,Of course women can groom as they please.  I just find it distasteful.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=disappointed,Pubic hair just strikes me as something a <i>man</i> would have, Marinette.  Not for me.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=confused,Expensive...?  On Mejare, you're told where to live...and you live there.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,And what do everyone's lives need saving from, exactly?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing,Surely you can think of a better insult than <i>buzzkill</i>.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing,I can't help but kill the buzz when a woman can't keep my interest.
0-good_hand,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:10=calm,A man is playing...this ought to be interesting.
0-good_hand,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:10=calm,A man...guess I'll be learning something tonight.
0-good_hand,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:10=impressed,A man...this raises the stakes.
0-good_hand,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:10=calm,Interesting.  I only know a few men.
0-good_hand,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:10=impressed,A man?  ...At least there's just one of you.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a=disappointed,Well, you're not from the Earth I know.  It's a wasteland, with the population living in giant gears.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a=calm,I've read about ladybugs.  Compared to most insects, they seem pleasant enough.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a=impressed,Ladybugs <i>do</i> sound pleasant, but taking inspiration from them is on another level entirely.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:insulting_meia,saidMarker:marinette_phc=disappointed,Whatever you just called me, Marinette, I've heard worse from Mejarian soldiers.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:insulting_meia,saidMarker:marinette_phc=disappointed,I thought superheroes were supposed to be brave, but apparently you don't have the nerve to insult me in a language I understand, Marinette.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:insulting_meia,saidMarker:marinette_phc=disappointed,You know what I <i>do</i> respect, Marinette?  A woman who can look me in the eye when she takes issue with me.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,..."Condoms"?  What are those?  Something that controls birth?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,...What's a <i>condom</i>?  Why are you all hushed up about it?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=annoyed,...No, I <i>don't</i> know.  You could be more considerate of a woman who isn't from Earth and doesn't know what condoms are.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=awkward,...What is it about sex with men that makes Earth women get all quiet?  And what's a <i>condom</i>?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_pussy=addressing,Watch where you put your mouth, Sei.  You're without your precious gauntlets.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_pussy=addressing,"Mouth on my pussy," Sei?  I see Mejarian sex got its inspiration from Earth women.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_pussy=addressing,"Mouth on my pussy," Sei?  Earth women are so vulgar.  Must be from living around men.

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=addressing,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Don't tell me that's an Earthling's idea of how to pleasure a fellow woman.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=addressing,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Earth women are so vulgar.  Must be from living around men.
0-good_hand,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=calm,No men playing?  I thought Earth was home to plenty of them.
0-good_hand,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,All women...well, it's familiar.
0-good_hand,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=impressed,Oh, I see.  They must keep these games single-sex.
0-good_hand,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=thinking,I really thought I'd see a man here...
0-good_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=surprised-horny,I'm the...only woman?
0-good_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=angry,All men...don't try anything funny.
0-good_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=bored,All men, no women...wouldn't be surprised if Jura was pulling a prank here.
0-good_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=impressed,I was really expecting a few women here...
0-good_hand,totalFemales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,All men...?  This is more than I bargained for.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,If you really are doing that in real time, I might believe you're an android.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Earth has the resources to build near-perfect androids and send them to strip poker games...and still they Harvest us.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,The Pod itself doesn't impress me...Pyoro is similar, and he can talk.  But if you're the machine you say you are, that's something else...
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Our ship robot Pyoro can do much of the same, and he too acts human.  <i>You</i>, meanwhile, are on another level...if you're not lying.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=pleased,Something bothering you, Jura?  Not what you had hoped for?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=unimpressed,Oh, good, now we're <i>both</i> annoyed.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,Perfect.  Now <i>neither</i> of us want to be here.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=awkward,I really didn't want to see a man's tube anyway...not in a seedy place like this.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=unimpressed,I'd call this your comeuppance, but we still need to see this game through.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,Men would have been a distraction anyway.  This way we can focus on learning about Earth from the women here.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=pleased,Exactly what you deserve, dragging me here.  Have fun.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I guess you're not too concerned with winning...
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,Talking to you is exhausting...
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=unimpressed,Well, at least <i>one</i> of us is having a good time.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I like to stay sober...in every sense of the word.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,...I'm totally lost.  She said something about controlled birth?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,I'm lost.  Earth women control birth?  I think Tarak does something like that...
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,I'm lost here.  What exactly is "birth control"?  How would you control birth?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=thinking,To answer your question, Sei...sort of.  Both my parents were women.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=thinking,Mejarians are born from two women, Sei.  The Oma donates half an egg, and the Fama carries the combination...
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=unimpressed,...If <i>mother</i> and <i>father</i> helps you understand, Sei, then yes.  Though I can't picture a man being a parent.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=impressed,...Men really are full of surprises.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=confused,...So you can't fly with those wings?  Why does your species have them?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=impressed,I think I read about angels as a girl...but they sure weren't depicted as winged men.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Alright, soldier.  Sober up and focus for a moment.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Better sober up, Sei.  It's just you and me now.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Think you can take me alone, Sei?  Perhaps if you were sober.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Just you and me, Sei.  Make this worth it for me.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,A soldier should be able to appreciate a good showdown, even when she's drunk.

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,I smell an easy kill.  And it smells like alcohol.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Now would be a good time for those nanobots to sober you up, Sei.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Just you and me, Sei...but not for long.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Forgive me for not being worried about this showdown.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Surprised a man would wear armbands.  So does Jura.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,A man wearing armbands?  That's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Seems there's overlap between Mejarian and Earth fashion, with those armbands of yours.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,...I see you'd rather use natural advantages than take your loss with any dignity intact.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I assure you, being seen naked will not devalue you as a person.  Cheating, on the other hand, does.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,...Better than killing us, I suppose, but it's still pathetic to stave off a loss like this.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=unimpressed,Can't you just accept defeat with your honor intact?  That would actually give me some respect for you.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Even naked, you still had a chance.  This isn't even cheating to avoid total defeat.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:gwen,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,...I'm sorry, what?  Do I know you?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:gwen,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,<i>Gorgeous</i>?  That's a new one.

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Just one man...well, Jura, I hope you're happy with him.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Watch yourself.  Jura is looking for a man to have a child with...
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=bored,You'd best take care.  Jura's going to be needling you with questions all game.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,A man?  I'll try not to ask too many questions...Jura will do that for me.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=unimpressed,A man?  Well, Jura, looks like we'll be getting the anatomy lesson you wanted.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,This one man had better be impressive enough for us to come all the way here.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Try to ignore Jura, the taller woman.  She can be a little...forward.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,totalRounds:1-1=disappointed,Thanks for the compliment, but I didn't pick it out.  Squadron leaders all wear this.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,totalRounds:1-1=calm,Yours looks a little sleeker, honestly.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,totalRounds:1-1=disappointed,<i>Expand your wardrobe</i>?  Bodysuits are as sensible as it gets.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing,I must say, Pit, you're a new experience for me.  I never knew men could experience shyness.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I just don't see what the issue is, Pit.  Aren't you proud of your body?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,Why are you so embarrassed?  You don't seem to have any deformities...not that I'm an expert on male anatomy.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Life gets a lot worse than nudity, Pit.  Hold your head high.
0-good_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=disappointed,No one left for you to hide behind.  Now you deal with <i>me</i>.

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,I wouldn't call my armor "modern."  We use whatever we can pilfer from Mejarian outposts.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,I wouldn't call my armor "modern"...but I wouldn't call yours "comfortable."
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,Not sure what my having blue hair has got to do with anything.  Can Earth women's hair be naturally blue?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,<i>Fun</i>?  I hope so.  Jura wouldn't stop pestering me about it.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Well, Jura, this is what you wanted.  Satisfied with the crowd?
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Meia Gisborn.  The blonde is Jura Basil Elden.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=bored,Meia Gisborn, age twenty.  I'll let my crewmate here do the talking.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Meia Gisborn.  The taller woman is Jura, my crewmate...this was her idea.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=bored,Pleased to meet you.  Jura here will be happy to speak for both of us.
0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Meia Gisborn.  The taller woman is my crewmate, and she's a lot more excited to be here, if you couldn't tell.

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,<i>Protection</i>?  You need <i>protection</i> during sex?  I thought she was talking about birth.

0-good_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,Proper measures?  What exactly are you worried about?
0-good_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=bored,And then there were two.  Perhaps now I'll finally lose.
0-good_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=disappointed,Now it's just you and me.  I hope you're OK with that.
0-good_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=bored,One-on-one...maybe I'd be excited if you had made me lose at some point.
0-good_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=bored,One-on-one...and considering the challenge you've put up so far, this is probably over with.

0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Surprised a man would wear armbands.  So does Jura.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,A man wearing armbands?  That's <i>Mejarian</i> fashion.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Seems there's overlap between Mejarian and Earth fashion, with those armbands of yours.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,...I see you'd rather use natural advantages than take your loss with any dignity intact.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I assure you, being seen naked will not devalue you as a person.  Cheating, on the other hand, does.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,...Better than killing us, I suppose, but it's still pathetic to stave off a loss like this.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=unimpressed,Can't you just accept defeat with your honor intact?  That would actually give me some respect for you.

0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,The Pod itself doesn't impress me...Pyoro is similar, and he can talk.  But if you're the machine you say you are, that's something else...
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Our ship robot Pyoro can do much of the same, and he too acts human.  <i>You</i>, meanwhile, are on another level...if you're not lying.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=bored,The three men on our ship are enough for me.  And <i>they</i> don't try to get us naked, or strip themselves.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=bored,Well, Jura, plenty of men's tubes to go around.  Ready to collect that seed you want so badly?

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalFemales:2-2,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,Earth women would have been alien enough.  You didn't arrange this on purpose, did you, Jura?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=thinking,To answer your question, Sei...sort of.  Both my parents were women.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=disappointed,Pubic hair just strikes me as something a <i>man</i> would have, Marinette.  Not for me.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:gwen,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,<i>Gorgeous</i>?  That's a new one.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=annoyed,...No, I <i>don't</i> know.  You could be more considerate of a woman who isn't from Earth and doesn't know what condoms are.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=awkward,...What is it about sex with men that makes Earth women get all quiet?  And what's a <i>condom</i>?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Well, you're not from the Earth I know.  It's a wasteland, with the population living in giant gears.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a,timeInStage:0-0=calm,I've read about ladybugs.  Compared to most insects, they seem pleasant enough.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a,timeInStage:0-0=impressed,Ladybugs <i>do</i> sound pleasant, but taking inspiration from them is on another level entirely.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,...I don't understand.  Why wouldn't you be able to feel your partner's skin?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=disappointed,Why are you getting all defensive?  I really don't know what this "birth control" is.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,Proper measures?  What exactly are you worried about?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,timeInStage:0-0,saidMarker:marinette_phc=disappointed,Whatever you just called me, Marinette, I've heard worse from Mejarian soldiers.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused,<i>Protection</i>?  You need <i>protection</i> during sex?  I thought she was talking about birth.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,totalRounds:1-1,count-jura:1=disappointed,You think we haven't seen each other nude?  The ship has one shower and one spa.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,totalRounds:1-1,count-jura:1=disappointed,Nude women aren't exactly startling to Mejarians...especially crewmates with communal showers.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,totalRounds:1-1,count-jura:1=unimpressed,I <i>wish</i> I wasn't so comfortable seeing Jura nude.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,totalRounds:1-1,count-jura:1=disappointed,We're not friends.  We're colleagues...and pirates don't get private showers.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Alright, soldier.  Let's see what you're made of.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,I'd say we're on pretty even footing, Sei.  So let's get right into it.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing,I must say, Pit, you're a new experience for me.  I never knew men could experience shyness.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I just don't see what the issue is, Pit.  Aren't you proud of your body?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward,Why are you so embarrassed?  You don't seem to have any deformities...not that I'm an expert on male anatomy.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Life gets a lot worse than nudity, Pit.  Hold your head high.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,...I see you'd rather use natural advantages than take your loss with any dignity intact.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I assure you, being seen naked will not devalue you as a person.  Cheating, on the other hand, does.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored,...Better than killing us, I suppose, but it's still pathetic to stave off a loss like this.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=unimpressed,Can't you just accept defeat with your honor intact?  That would actually give me some respect for you.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Even naked, you still had a chance.  This isn't even cheating to avoid total defeat.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=impressed,...Men really are full of surprises.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=confused,...So you can't fly with those wings?  Why does your species have them?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=impressed,I think I read about angels as a girl...but they sure weren't depicted as winged men.
0-bad_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=disappointed,No one left for you to hide behind.  Now you deal with <i>me</i>.
0-bad_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=bored,And then there were two.  Perhaps now I'll finally lose.
0-bad_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=disappointed,Now it's just you and me.  I hope you're OK with that.
0-bad_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=bored,One-on-one...maybe I'd be excited if you had made me lose at some point.
0-bad_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=bored,One-on-one...and considering the challenge you've put up so far, this is probably over with.
0-bad_hand,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,You haven't been much challenge so far.  Going to rise to the occasion now?

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,I wouldn't call my armor "modern."  We use whatever we can pilfer from Mejarian outposts.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,I wouldn't call my armor "modern"...but I wouldn't call yours "comfortable."
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,Not sure what my having blue hair has got to do with anything.  Can Earth women's hair be naturally blue?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:himeia,totalRounds:0-0,marker:sei_response=disappointed,<i>Fun</i>?  I hope so.  Jura wouldn't stop pestering me about it.

0-bad_hand,totalRounds:28-28=bored,Won't be getting much sleep tonight, with how long this game has been going.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=bored,You'd best take care.  Jura's going to be needling you with questions all game.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,A man?  I'll try not to ask too many questions...Jura will do that for me.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=unimpressed,A man?  Well, Jura, looks like we'll be getting the anatomy lesson you wanted.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,This one man had better be impressive enough for us to come all the way here.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1,totalRounds:0-0,priority:114=disappointed,Try to ignore Jura, the taller woman.  She can be a little...forward.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,totalRounds:1-1=disappointed,Thanks for the compliment, but I didn't pick it out.  Squadron leaders all wear this.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,totalRounds:1-1=calm,Yours looks a little sleeker, honestly.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,totalRounds:1-1=disappointed,<i>Expand your wardrobe</i>?  Bodysuits are as sensible as it gets.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=pleased,Something bothering you, Jura?  Not what you had hoped for?
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=unimpressed,Oh, good, now we're <i>both</i> annoyed.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=annoyed,Perfect.  Now <i>neither</i> of us want to be here.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=awkward,I really didn't want to see a man's tube anyway...not in a seedy place like this.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=unimpressed,I'd call this your comeuppance, but we still need to see this game through.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0,totalRounds:0-0=disappointed,Men would have been a distraction anyway.  This way we can focus on learning about Earth from the women here.

0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=addressing,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Don't tell me that's an Earthling's idea of how to pleasure a fellow woman.
0-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=addressing,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Earth women are so vulgar.  Must be from living around men.

1-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Seems there's overlap between Mejarian and Earth fashion, with those armbands of yours.

2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:captain_america,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Didn't think men could be that interested in fashion.
2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:captain_america,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I see.  And you probably acquired it legally, unlike me.

2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a,timeInStage:0-0=calm,I've read about ladybugs.  Compared to most insects, they seem pleasant enough.
2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:m_f_a,timeInStage:0-0=impressed,Ladybugs <i>do</i> sound pleasant, but taking inspiration from them is on another level entirely.

2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=annoyed,...No, I <i>don't</i> know.  You could be more considerate of a woman who isn't from Earth and doesn't know what condoms are.
2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=awkward,...What is it about sex with men that makes Earth women get all quiet?  And what's a <i>condom</i>?

2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,I smell an easy kill.  And it smells like alcohol.
2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,totalAlive:2-2,notSaidMarker:one-on-one,marker:one-on-one=addressing,Now would be a good time for those nanobots to sober you up, Sei.

2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Our ship robot Pyoro can do much of the same, and he too acts human.  <i>You</i>, meanwhile, are on another level...if you're not lying.

2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=addressing,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Don't tell me that's an Earthling's idea of how to pleasure a fellow woman.
2-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=addressing,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Earth women are so vulgar.  Must be from living around men.

0-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Took you long enough to beat me.
0-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,Surprised I'm winning, with so little on.
0-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Finally.  Give me a challenge or get lost.
0-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=disappointed,I lost with <i>that</i>?  Maybe I underestimated you...
0-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,You sure went the extra mile to finally beat me.
0-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I'm surprised that lost.  I'll have to take this seriously now.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Is that so?  Well, short men don't scare <i>me</i>.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Awfully confident.  The only other short, boisterous man I know is worthless at cards.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,And men don't scare <i>me</i>.  Especially ones with <i>your</i> build.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,Big talk from a little man.
0-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,At least I started ahead.
0-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=impressed,Now that I'm looking...none of <i>you</i> are wearing much, either.
0-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I thought <i>Mejarians</i> could dress scantily...none of you have much of anything on.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?  Do you know a woman who looks like me?
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,Sounds like the resemblance is uncanny.  Maybe you should introduce us.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,...What are you implying?  That's just who I am.  Is there a similar woman I should know about?
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...Why wouldn't I be?
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,What's the big deal?  It's just a card game.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,I try to be.  It's important for a leader to not lose her composure.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,...What?  Aya--what?
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,...Who's Ayanami Rei?  Is this someone I should know?
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,...<i>Meia Gisborn</i> in person, actually.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,You seem awfully proud of being a pirate, Elaine.  I try not to bring it up.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,I try to be.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,It's in my best interest.
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,So are you, to notice that.
0-must_strip_normal=annoyed,Damn...
0-must_strip_normal=annoyed,I was hoping you wouldn't notice that I hadn't lost yet.
0-must_strip_normal=disappointed,Had to happen eventually.
0-must_strip_normal=bored,I was planning on ignoring the "stripping" part of this game.
0-must_strip_normal=annoyed,Oh, well...
0-must_strip_normal=thinking,Jura <i>did</i> say this game would loosen me up...
0-must_strip_normal=disappointed,...

0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Right out of the hangar...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Right away...got to get ahold of myself.
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Just nerves...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Bad start...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,That took forever.  Here goes...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,I did last a while...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Finally comes around to me...
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,It took you this long to beat me?
0-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I was getting worried you'd <i>never</i> manage to beat me.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chun-li=disappointed,...I don't know who that is, but I'll assume it's complimentary.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,I'm a squadron leader.  It's important for me to stay collected...who's this "Cammy" you know?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,You could say that.  You could compare me to this "Cammy," too, if you want...not like I know if it's accurate.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chun-li=bored,I've never been a fan of nonsense, no.  Is this "Cammy" the same way?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,I hope you don't think this magically puts you in a good position.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,You're still losing, Jura.  What are you so excited about?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,So be it.  I made a mistake and paid for it.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=unimpressed,I'm having more fun already.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1-2=bored,My <i>bodysuit</i> is one piece.  I'm wearing armor over it...and it's not coming off first.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1-2=disappointed,...<i>Spacesuit</i>?  This suit is for piloting, not navigating the vacuum of space.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1-2=disappointed,..."Spacesuit"?  I don't float around in the middle of space with this on.  We have much bulkier spacesuits that let us breathe.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1-2=bored,I hate to break it to you, Ami, but my suit's not coming off first.  Neither is the armor over it.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,...Is there something wrong with any of those things?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,What are you mumbling about?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,...This isn't a combat visor.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,...Are you trying to size me up, 9S?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=unimpressed,You haven't exactly dazzled me so far, Jura.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,You don't have much to be proud of at the moment.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,Don't start congratulating yourself over one win.  You could beat me if you tried.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,You're happy that I lost <i>once</i>?  You should really hold yourself to a higher standard...here <i>and</i> in your Dread.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,I don't need to wear more than you, nor do I <i>want</i> to.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,Wearing excess clothing is only useful <i>here</i>.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=annoyed,I wouldn't even know what to do with all your clothes.  You only ever wear that same dress anyway.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=disappointed,...Sounds like <i>you're</i> the cocky one.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=disappointed,I'm not afraid to lose.  I just don't want to...and I won't.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Just sizing things up...hopefully that was enough.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Having the first attack doesn't mean much unless it's the winning one.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,I don't baby you when we're piloting.  You shouldn't expect it here.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,You know how to play cards perfectly well.  Don't ask for your opponents to take pity on you.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Would you ask the <i>Harvest</i> to take pity on you?  Or even a Mejarian soldier?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,As if you aren't perfectly happy to display your body in public.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_disdain=disappointed,I'm not here to have fun.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_disdain=bored,Look, I'm only here because Jura wouldn't stop bothering me...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_disdain=bored,You seem like you're having enough fun for both of us.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=disappointed,...Only if you'll keep it.  I don't want Jura bringing back any proof I did this.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=bored,Oh, perfect.  Physical evidence that Jura talked me into this.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=bored,Can't you just take two pictures of Jura instead?  We'd <i>both</i> prefer that...and there'd be no proof I was here.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=bored,...Fine.  Make it quick, and don't give it to Jura.  She'll have proof she convinced me to do this.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:alice_degracia=bored,Mejare is my home planet, and also Earth's personal colony for harvesting breasts and uteri...being nothing but women.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:alice_degracia=disappointed,Mejare is my home planet...the planet of women.  It's a great place if you're a fan of propaganda and oppression.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:alice_degracia=bored,What's it <i>like</i>?  Mostly barren, with tightly monitored living districts...that the government shuts down at will.  And all-women.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:alice_degracia=disappointed,Mejare, the planet of women, is a remote colony of Earth's...and my home.  But I'm not fond of its wasteful policies.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=bored,Yes, we're not from Earth.  Jura and I were born on Mejare, which is populated exclusively by women.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=disappointed,I wouldn't joke about something that alienates us so much.  We're from Mejare, where only women live.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=bored,No, we're not trying to fool you.  Our home planet is Mejare, the planet of women...and Earth's uterus colony.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=disappointed,We're being serious.  Jura and I are crewmates on a Mejarian pirate ship...Mejare is known for being inhabited only by women.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.

0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Well, I've given it some thought...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,I don't want to do this, but it's just a game...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,My first choice?  Well, to an outsider, it's obvious...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,I know what I'm stripping first...unfortunately.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,At least you're done masturbating, but your commentary isn't amusing.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=unimpressed,I've had it with your little comments.  At least pick yourself up off the floor.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=unimpressed,I'm not interested in what a loser has to say.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Oh, be quiet.  You've disappointed me all night.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Give it a rest.  I'm ashamed to call you my second-in-command.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=disappointed,...You <i>are</i> aware you've lost, right?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=disappointed,Correct me if I'm wrong, Pit, but "the rest" seems to include <i>you</i>.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=disappointed,...I see sexual activity seems to make men forget their <i>own</i> situations.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...Why wouldn't I be?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,What's the big deal?  It's just a card game.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,I try to be.  It's important for a leader to not lose her composure.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,I could use an amusement device right about now...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=disappointed,So they're interactive electronics?  So are my Dread's controls.  I wouldn't call that a <i>game</i>.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=unimpressed,Is this sort of thing common knowledge on Earth, and the other women are just more polite about it?
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,I bet Parfet would get a kick out of this tech history...I'm more concerned with the here and now.

0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=disappointed,I suppose the bangs match.  Rather superfluous.

0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Don't even talk to me...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,Just keep masturbating.  I don't want to hear from you.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,Give it a rest already.  I expected better from you.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=annoyed,<i>Just shut up</i>.

0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=unimpressed,Spend more time practicing and less time bragging, and you'd be in my position.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=unimpressed,It's called <i>applying yourself</i>, Jura, and you're capable of it.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Better to be disappointed in myself for losing a hand to someone who wasn't even trying.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:nagisa=confused,...<i>Astronaut</i>?  That's a light way of putting it...
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:nagisa=disappointed,<i>Cool</i>?  That's a new one.

0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
0-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=disappointed,I lost with <i>that</i>?  Maybe I underestimated you...
0-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,You sure went the extra mile to finally beat me.

0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,count-mahiru:1=bored,Can't you just take two pictures of Jura instead?  We'd <i>both</i> prefer that...and there'd be no proof I was here.

#losing armor
1-stripped=thinking,That was a gift from my Oma.
1-stripped=thinking,It's nothing...let's just keep going.
1-stripped=annoyed,Continue, please.  I'd like to move on.
1-stripped=annoyed,Deal, please.
1-stripped=angry,<i>Deal.</i>
1-stripped=angry,What are you staring at?
1-stripped=thinking,...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=pleased,So it <i>is</i> women's hair.  I'll inform Hibiki about that.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=pleased,Well, Corrin <i>does</i> look rather feminine.  But then, there's masculine-looking women I respect.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=addressing,Well, Corrin <i>does</i> look rather feminine.  But I object to the idea that "feminine" means weak.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,Not everyone has to be serious.  It's just probably better for the squadron if <i>I</i> am...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=thinking,I <i>have</i> to be serious...I'm a leader.  But you're fine the way you are, I'm sure.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,I'm not a role model.  Well, I <i>try</i> to be, but I make too many mistakes...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,It's not a costume, it's <i>armor</i>.  But you're right, I need it for shocks while flying.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=awkward,Well, technically it exists for shocks, but it's more of a symbol of rank...only a few of my pilots wear something like it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=disappointed,Under my armor?  The rest of my bodysuit.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=bored,If it's jiggling you want, Barnette's the woman for you.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=bored,I haven't so much been <i>out</i> in space as I just <i>live</i> there.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,<i>Jiggling</i>?  I don't have the breasts for that...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,You shouldn't insult people you've just met.  You really <i>are</i> like Hibiki.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,In general, if a woman is wearing something, it means a lot to her.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=annoyed,Don't insult the clothing of others without knowing them first.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=addressing,Well, isn't that sweet.  You remind me of a short, excitable pain-in-the-neck man I work with.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=addressing,Funny.  I would say the same thing about Hibiki, who shares <i>your</i> personality...and genitalia, presumably.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,I try to be a reliable leader to my pilots, so apparently it's a good disposition to have.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,At least you care about her.  Wasn't sure men were capable of those sorts of feelings.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=addressing,A pain in the neck, am I?  The feeling's mutual.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,Mejare would have you believe that, yes.  But they would also have you believe that men want to feast on your organs.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,Call us villains if you want, but Mejare and Tarak both deserve piracy.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,I don't have glowing opinions of Earth's heroics, either.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,<i>Eyepatch</i>?  It was a gift from my Oma.  It means a lot to me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_headset,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,It doesn't do anything.  It was a gift from my Oma.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_headset,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,It has no function.  My Oma gave it to me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,It's fine, Jura.  Just enjoy yourself...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,...Leave it be.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Don't worry about it...or what the rest think.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,...Please stop talking.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=thinking,Oh, I see.  I'm sorry...it must mean a lot to you.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=thinking,That makes sense.  Who gave it to you?  A parent?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=thinking,I can understand.  But it <i>does</i> count...and I figure no one will touch it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=thinking,I see.  That cross looks nice, but I won't pry.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=calm,Well, don't be defeatist.  Maybe you won't lose.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,You should know me better...sometimes you have to let these things go.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,Just a tactical move...they're important.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,It's not unlike me...a leader has to make difficult decisions.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,It's part of leadership...to make decisions like that.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,You need to be a leader too, Jura...those are the kinds of decisions you have to make.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Now you've made them all curious...I didn't want to draw attention to it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,...Thank you, Jura, but I'm fine, really.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,It's just a keepsake.  I'm putting it back on after this.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,Part of the game, like anything else.  Just leave it be.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,It's just sitting there...I had to strip, so I stripped.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,I can be without it for a while.  Nothing's going to happen to it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,I'll be watching it, but nothing should happen...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,It would look strange to keep it on...I'd rather avoid those questions.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,Standing naked with it on would just look strange...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,...Just make sure it's safe, OK?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,It's OK, Jura.  I'm fine.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Don't make a big deal of it.  It's not like it's gone forever.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,I take it off to sleep.  No worse than that...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,You can go back to teasing me now, Jura.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=thinking,I said it's <i>fine</i>.  Let's keep going.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Stop drawing attention to it and deal.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,I don't want them asking questions.  Just keep playing.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Don't make a big fuss...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Whatever...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Just make sure no one touches it...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,...It's no issue.  Really.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Just let it sit over there...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,"Mother"?  Must be the Earth term for it...an Oma is an egg donor.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,I said <i>Oma</i>.  Or is "mother" what you call them on Earth?  I thought men were your Omas...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,What's a "mother"?  I said it was from my Oma...maybe I'm just unfamiliar with Earth terminology.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9,marker:oma_and_fama=awkward,"Mother"?  If Earth has a word for Omas, maybe Mejarian reproductive methods aren't so foreign to you...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:9,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,I said <i>Oma</i>.  It was my understanding that men and women reproduced together on Earth...is that what you meant?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,"Mother"?  Must be the Earth term for it...an Oma is an egg donor.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,priority:141,count-futaba:1=bored,That makes one of us.  So...you work with this "Rei" woman?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,priority:141,count-futaba:1=bored,...I need to see a photograph of this girl.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,priority:141,count-futaba:1=bored,I'd <i>also</i> like to see how, and whether this "Rei" really bears such a strong resemblance to me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,I don't...I think my Oma's company made them, but they never finalized it.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,I'm sorry.  I've never even seen another one...so I can't help there.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,You're better off just practicing.  I don't know where my Oma got it from.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=thinking,It's the only one of its kind I know of.  That's why it's a good memento...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=impressed,Red eyes?  Sounds like a fearsome woman.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Unlike blue hair, red eyes are <i>not</i> common on Mejare.  Now I don't know how you confused us.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,Just an honest mistake, I'm sure.  Meia Gisborn, pleased to meet you.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,Just an honest mistake, I'm sure.  I'm from Mejare...I assume this "Ayanami Rei" is an Earth woman.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,That's alright.  It'll be fine if I just set it down here...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,Thank you, but...it'll be fine.  It's not fragile or anything...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,Don't worry about me, Jura.  I can handle myself.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,Don't burden yourself just because I'm all sentimental...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,It's not your responsibility, Jura.  Just focus on the game.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,...It's OK, Jura.  Just disappointed...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,...Promise me you're going to work harder from now on.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,That wasn't anything directed at you.  It was small...so it goes first.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Think nothing of it...leave that to me.
1-must_strip_winning=bored,I'm getting complacent...I never get complacent.
1-must_strip_winning=bored,I got complacent there...must be my co-pilots rubbing off on me.
1-must_strip_winning=bored,Damn...
1-must_strip_winning=thinking,Lost my focus...lost my vigilance.
1-must_strip_winning=thinking,Never blame someone else for your losses...
1-must_strip_winning=disappointed,A chink in the armor.
1-must_strip_winning=disappointed,...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,That's right.  What's wrong with that?  Is this mystery woman a pilot, too?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,I do.  I lead the Nirvana's Dread squadron.  Is there something strange about that to you?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,Yes.  I pilot a Dread...I'm the squadron's commander.  It's...stimulating work.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,...I don't know what a "dude" is.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=confused,...What's a "dude"?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,...Excuse me?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,My Fama had blue hair, and my Oma made sure I had it, too...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Natural.  I imagine yours is, too, or you wouldn't be so cavalier about it.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=calm,Very few Mejarians have dyed hair.  Genetic engineering already makes the colors pretty outlandish...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=bored,If you think <i>blue hair</i> is noteworthy, check out Barnette's green.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Blue hair is nothing special on Mejare.  Paiway has it, my Fama had it...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=bored,<i>Seas</i>?  Mejare doesn't have much water...and we waste what we <i>do</i> have.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Yes...it would seem so.  I must be blushing...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,I'm blushing, aren't I?  Perceptive...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=thinking,...Yes, I am.  Can't afford mistakes, or to show weakness.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Great.  I must be all flush for <i>man</i> to notice...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I actually <i>do</i> pilot a mech.  Well, a Dread.  ...What's wrong with that, Misato?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot Vandread-Meia, which is a mech.  ...Is something wrong with that, Misato?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot the Super Vandread, which is a mech.  ...You look surprised, Misato.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=disappointed,What's there to debate?  Was there a similar invention around the same time?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,Clearly Earth needs to keep better records, then...so does Mejare.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,There's a <i>community</i> of you people?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,Is there any productivity to be had with these games, or do they just waste time?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:rinkah=bored,Fought in a war?  Well, as pirates, we mostly stage raids...but you're right, there are men I've come to respect.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:rinkah=disappointed,Tarak and Mejare are <i>both</i> detestable...but there are people from both planets I respect, yes.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:rinkah=disappointed,Well, until recently I thought men were aliens...the men I've worked with since have improved my opinion of them.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:rinkah=bored,I'm a pirate...don't lump me in with Mejarian imperials.  Tarak's no better, but some of its citizens are.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually <i>do</i> pilot a mech.  Well, a Dread.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot Vandread-Meia, which is a mech.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot the Super Vandread, which is a mech.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...Yes, Ochako?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...I'm listening.  What is it?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...You have my attention, Ochako.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,Blue hair is fairly common on Mejare, actually...but I didn't know Earth men could have it.  And what is this boy like?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,Perhaps you could tell me about him, then.  Is it just his hair color that's similar, or his demeanor?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,That's the word for a child man, right?  I wasn't aware Earth men could have blue hair.  What's he like?
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,...Thank you.  I have a crewmate with your brown hair who recently had a baby...but maybe you could tell me about this boy.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,Just focus on your own outfit.  There's only so many small things you can strip.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,I'd pay attention to my <i>own</i> outfit if I were you.  No hope for me...already down to my armor.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,Thank you for apologizing, but it doesn't matter anymore...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,My memories would remain even without it.  I don't want to bring things down anymore...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=annoyed,Just drop it, Jura.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Ugh...I'm all shaken.  I'm sorry you have to see me like this, Jura.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=thinking,I don't want to dwell on the issue...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=thinking,Thought that wouldn't bother me, but I guess it did...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,Speaking of which, you should worry more about your own situation, Jura.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,I'm not wearing much, Jura.  You're not as far behind as you think.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I can't get too flustered when my crewmate is next to me wearing five square inches of fabric.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,I've come to expect this sort of thing from you, honestly.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,...I've been blushing, huh?  Guess I'm not as stoic as I'd like...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Your concern for me is sweet, but I'm fine.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,...I had a feeling my face was giving me away.  Oh, well...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=interested,Worrying about <i>me</i> when you're naked is surprisingly selfless, Jura.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,I wouldn't expect you to value winning when you've never applied yourself a day in your life.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,That doesn't look fun at all...masturbation should be private.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,I'd rather have a bed to sit on...if I were to do it at all.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,My chief complaint with you is that you don't focus <i>enough</i> on winning.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,I'll enjoy my self-respect and be on my way.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,...Fine.  You've already humiliated yourself, so there's no point in being sour about it any longer.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,...OK.  But you'd better work harder piloting after this.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,I consider this all the leeway I might've given you in flight practice, so you'd better take it seriously.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Alright, alright.  You can't fall any further...so it's time I picked up the slack.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,Well, don't draw attention to it.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,Nobody else was saying anything about it...just leave it be.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,Unless the rest of them are desperate to know, then just let it alone.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,You're right...I don't get like this.  I'm sorry I just did.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,It's fine.  I'm moving past it now.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,I don't want to be a distraction, least of all to <i>you</i>...
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,You're right...a Leader can't lose herself over something trivial.  I'm sorry.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,No, it wasn't.  Just a memento.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,It was a gift.  So I wear it to remember.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,It really isn't.  Mejarian soldiers are much better-outfitted.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,...What is it, Sei?
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Guess I collected myself for a while...
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,My lead takes a hit at last...
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,Got sloppy...couldn't maintain my streak.
1-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=impressed,I lost with <i>that</i>?  Maybe you <i>can</i> give me a challenge...
1-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,<i>That</i> lost?  You could hang around with Gascogne...
1-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I'm surprised that lost.  I'll have to channel Gascogne to beat you.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Damn it...at least I still have a lead.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Again...I'm throwing my lead away.
1-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,So soon after the first...
1-must_strip_normal=bored,...
1-must_strip_normal=annoyed,Damn.  I've been all flustered...
1-must_strip_normal=thinking,It's not luck.  I just made a mistake.
1-must_strip_normal=bored,I'm making too many missteps...
1-must_strip_normal=thinking,Got to calm down...I'm not focusing on the game.
1-must_strip_normal=bored,All my fault...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,I wouldn't expect you to value winning when you've never applied yourself a day in your life.

1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,I don't want to be a distraction, least of all to <i>you</i>...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,You're right...a Leader can't lose herself over something trivial.  I'm sorry.
1-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=impressed,I lost with <i>that</i>?  Maybe you <i>can</i> give me a challenge...
1-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,<i>That</i> lost?  You could hang around with Gascogne...
1-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I'm surprised that lost.  I'll have to channel Gascogne to beat you.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...Yes, Ochako?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...I'm listening.  What is it?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...You have my attention, Ochako.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah=bored,Fought in a war?  Well, as pirates, we mostly stage raids...but you're right, there are men I've come to respect.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah=disappointed,Tarak and Mejare are <i>both</i> detestable...but there are people from both planets I respect, yes.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah=disappointed,Well, until recently I thought men were aliens...the men I've worked with since have improved my opinion of them.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:rinkah=bored,I'm a pirate...don't lump me in with Mejarian imperials.  Tarak's no better, but some of its citizens are.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,My Fama had blue hair, and my Oma made sure I had it, too...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Natural.  I imagine yours is, too, or you wouldn't be so cavalier about it.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=calm,Very few Mejarians have dyed hair.  Genetic engineering already makes the colors pretty outlandish...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=bored,If you think <i>blue hair</i> is noteworthy, check out Barnette's green.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Blue hair is nothing special on Mejare.  Paiway has it, my Fama had it...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually <i>do</i> pilot a mech.  Well, a Dread.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot Vandread-Meia, which is a mech.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot the Super Vandread, which is a mech.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=bored,<i>Seas</i>?  Mejare doesn't have much water...and we waste what we <i>do</i> have.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Yes...it would seem so.  I must be blushing...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,I'm blushing, aren't I?  Perceptive...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=thinking,...Yes, I am.  Can't afford mistakes, or to show weakness.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Great.  I must be all flush for <i>man</i> to notice...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,Speaking of which, you should worry more about your own situation, Jura.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,I'm not wearing much, Jura.  You're not as far behind as you think.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I can't get too flustered when my crewmate is next to me wearing five square inches of fabric.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,I've come to expect this sort of thing from you, honestly.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,Well, don't draw attention to it.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,Nobody else was saying anything about it...just leave it be.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,Unless the rest of them are desperate to know, then just let it alone.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,That's right.  What's wrong with that?  Is this mystery woman a pilot, too?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,I do.  I lead the Nirvana's Dread squadron.  Is there something strange about that to you?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,Yes.  I pilot a Dread...I'm the squadron's commander.  It's...stimulating work.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Don't worry about me...I'm over it.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Just a few mistakes...think nothing of it.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,I'm not going to blame my failures on sentimentality...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,I'm fine.  Just playing badly...that's all.
1-must_strip_losing=annoyed,I really need to focus...
1-must_strip_losing=annoyed,Damn it, I'm <i>better</i> than this...
1-must_strip_losing=annoyed,I should've known losing my eyepiece would fluster me...
1-must_strip_losing=thinking,What a miserable loss...
1-must_strip_losing=bored,Mgh...I shouldn't be losing at all.
1-must_strip_losing=bored,...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=bored,<i>Seas</i>?  Mejare doesn't have much water...and we waste what we <i>do</i> have.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Yes...it would seem so.  I must be blushing...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,I'm blushing, aren't I?  Perceptive...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=thinking,...Yes, I am.  Can't afford mistakes, or to show weakness.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Great.  I must be all flush for <i>man</i> to notice...

1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,Why do you all wear such extraneous clothing?
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Unbelievable...
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Any extra clothing...should be personally meaningful.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,That's right.  What's wrong with that?  Is this mystery woman a pilot, too?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,I do.  I lead the Nirvana's Dread squadron.  Is there something strange about that to you?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,Yes.  I pilot a Dread...I'm the squadron's commander.  It's...stimulating work.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,...I don't know what a "dude" is.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gwen=confused,...What's a "dude"?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,...Excuse me?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,I actually <i>do</i> pilot a mech.  Well, a Dread.

1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...I'm listening.  What is it?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,...You have my attention, Ochako.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Flustered...<i>and</i> losing.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,I'm all shaken up...and to top it off, I'm losing.
1-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Can't believe myself...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,It really isn't.  Mejarian soldiers are much better-outfitted.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,I wouldn't expect you to value winning when you've never applied yourself a day in your life.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,That doesn't look fun at all...masturbation should be private.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,I'd rather have a bed to sit on...if I were to do it at all.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,My chief complaint with you is that you don't focus <i>enough</i> on winning.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,I'll enjoy my self-respect and be on my way.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,...Fine.  You've already humiliated yourself, so there's no point in being sour about it any longer.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,...OK.  But you'd better work harder piloting after this.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,I consider this all the leeway I might've given you in flight practice, so you'd better take it seriously.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Alright, alright.  You can't fall any further...so it's time I picked up the slack.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,My Fama had blue hair, and my Oma made sure I had it, too...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:blue_strip,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Natural.  I imagine yours is, too, or you wouldn't be so cavalier about it.

1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=disappointed,What's there to debate?  Was there a similar invention around the same time?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,Clearly Earth needs to keep better records, then...so does Mejare.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,There's a <i>community</i> of you people?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,Is there any productivity to be had with these games, or do they just waste time?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,Blue hair is fairly common on Mejare, actually...but I didn't know Earth men could have it.  And what is this boy like?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,Perhaps you could tell me about him, then.  Is it just his hair color that's similar, or his demeanor?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,That's the word for a child man, right?  I wasn't aware Earth men could have blue hair.  What's he like?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,...Thank you.  I have a crewmate with your brown hair who recently had a baby...but maybe you could tell me about this boy.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,No, it wasn't.  Just a memento.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,It was a gift.  So I wear it to remember.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,...What is it, Sei?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I actually <i>do</i> pilot a mech.  Well, a Dread.  ...What's wrong with that, Misato?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot Vandread-Meia, which is a mech.  ...Is something wrong with that, Misato?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I actually pilot a Dread ship...and I co-pilot the Super Vandread, which is a mech.  ...You look surprised, Misato.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=annoyed,Just drop it, Jura.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Ugh...I'm all shaken.  I'm sorry you have to see me like this, Jura.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=thinking,I don't want to dwell on the issue...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=thinking,Thought that wouldn't bother me, but I guess it did...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Don't worry about me...I'm over it.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,Just a few mistakes...think nothing of it.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,I'm not going to blame my failures on sentimentality...
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,I'm fine.  Just playing badly...that's all.
1-stripping=losing armor,At least I can get out of this armor now.
1-stripping=losing armor,This armor was a pain anyway.
1-stripping=losing armor,Give me a moment.  This is pressurized...
1-stripping=losing armor,This armor is always a pain to remove when I sleep...
1-stripping=losing armor,Alright, alright.  Hold on...this armor is awkward.
1-stripping=losing armor,Maybe this will calm my nerves...
1-stripping=losing armor,...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia2=losing armor,...Chiaki, Mejare doesn't use Earth years.  How long ago was 1958?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia2=losing armor,I <i>have</i> heard of tennis...it's a spectator sport.  Why not just play the real thing?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia2=losing armor,Why play tennis <i>electronically</i>?  Exercise is good for you...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia2=losing armor,I see these video games needed time to develop advanced enough technology for <i>doubles</i> tennis.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia2=losing armor,Perhaps this would be fascinating if I had context for what any of it meant.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia2=losing armor,1958...in <i>Earth</i> years?  Even the timeframes are confusing me now.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing armor,It's mostly for shocks while flying and the occasional laser on the ground.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing armor,It doesn't help all that much...most of my pilots don't wear it.  It shows my rank as squadron leader.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing armor,It's mostly worn to show my rank.  Valore, another squadron leader, wears it as well.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing armor,Funny you say that...my Dread is the fastest in the fleet.  So I, too, value evasion...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing armor,I agree with evasion being superior...better not to take hits at all than try to withstand them.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing armor,It's good to meet a man with some technical knowledge, I suppose.  Hibiki's approach is to charge straight forward, mashing at the controls...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing armor,I was about to ask why you're being so friendly to a stranger.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing armor,I'm not quite sure your image of a pirate aligns with mine...but yes, I am.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing armor,That's true.  I try not to bring it up unless asked.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing armor,Yes, I'm a pirate.  It's not glamorous, but the alternative...is living on Mejare.  That's far worse.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing armor,Piracy is nothing to brag about, but yes, I am one.  Fire away.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing armor,Yes.  I command the Nirvana's Dread squadron.  This armor signifies such.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing armor,Yes.  It's...interesting, to say the least.  But dangerous, hence the armor.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing armor,I command the Nirvana's Dread pilots, actually.  That's why I have this armor, to signify that.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=losing armor,...I'm listening.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=losing armor,Whatever you're thinking, you're wrong.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=losing armor,I've what?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing armor,I don't <i>need</i> my armor to fly...plenty of my pilots wear no protection at all.  It's just a display of rank.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing armor,Well, it aids in shocks as I fly...but I don't <i>need</i> it.  It's actually to show I'm the squadron leader.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing armor,It mostly exists to signify my rank as leader.  Still, it's probably saved my life on a few occasions...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing armor,It's just armor...it's optional for our pilots.  But it shows my rank, so I wear it.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing armor,What exactly is <i>human</i> to a man with <i>wings</i>?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing armor,<i>I'm</i> human.  Not sure what <i>you</i> are.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing armor,If by "human" you mean "Earthling," I suppose Mejarian armor is quite different, yes.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=losing armor,I don't know what a Nohrian is, but I'll take your word for it.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah,marker:state_schools=losing armor,Prejudice?  Closer to ignorance, I'd say...Mejare's schools teach that men want to eat our livers.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=losing armor,Well, we don't <i>look</i> similar.  But I suppose that's your point...men and women look different, too.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=losing armor,If you want to see those blinded by prejudice, look at Mejare's government...we're pirates, and we have no allegiance.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=losing armor,<i>Like home</i>?  Aren't you an Earth man?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=losing armor,It's just armor.  This isn't combat.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing armor,I'm glad you're here to do the bragging for me.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing armor,At least you're here to speak for me.  I'd rather not talk much...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing armor,I wouldn't advertise this armor much.  It's just whatever we could steal...you know that.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing armor,I'm sure Earth's armors are more impressive in places...or at least legitimately obtained.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=losing armor,...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=losing armor,I noticed.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=losing armor,You have me to thank for that.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=losing armor,It attaches.  And I don't just float around in space.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing armor,Your commentary is riveting.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing armor,I've never given the suit much thought.  Covers everything, restricts nothing.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing armor,My bodysuit...I suppose some people <i>would</i> find that stimulating.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing armor,I wouldn't sing its praises too much.  Technically there isn't much skin on display.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing armor,Your lecherous comments aren't making this more enjoyable.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing armor,Can't believe I've been reduced to my crewmate's pornography.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing armor,Please stop talking.  You're making this worse.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing armor,At least you appreciate my body.  That makes one of us.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing armor,I can't even picture you in anything but that dress...or stark-naked, apparently.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing armor,It does its job, and it signifies my rank.  So I don't complain...best if <i>you</i> don't, if you hope to wear it one day.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing armor,You're more into the idea of being squadron leader for the attention than the outfit, I imagine.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing armor,A pirate has to work with what's given to her.  Surely I've told you that...it applies <i>here</i>, too.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing armor,I'm your leader, no matter what...unless you feel like working enough to be promoted over me.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing armor,Hard to be yourself when you're out of your element...of course <i>you're</i> comfortable here.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing armor,We'll see if my mood improves without this bulky armor on.  Don't expect me to reach <i>your</i> levels of comfort, though.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing armor,Am I really any different than usual?  Did you think I'd keep my eyepiece on when it's just a game?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing armor,Maybe I will.  I've been on edge since I got here, but I don't see how being <i>more</i> vulnerable will help.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing armor,I <i>am</i> in a decent mood.  I can be <i>more</i> miserable if you'd like.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing armor,You may be right in that this armor just naturally puts me on edge...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing armor,I didn't pick out an outfit for coming here...maybe it's the armor that's got me irritated.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing armor,I can't see why <i>you're</i> so relaxed, with your dress ready to go any moment...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing armor,It's substantial...unlike everything you've removed thus far.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing armor,I don't have the accessories you do, so it's time for the armor already.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing armor,There isn't much to this flightsuit.  Don't ask me what the point of this game is when our layer counts aren't standardized.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing armor,I thought everyone had to wear the same number of items...so I just came in my armor, as always.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing armor,Yes, we're pirates.  We only do it to survive...well, <i>I</i> do.  Let Jura speak for herself.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing armor,I try not to bring up my piracy unless asked.  It's not glamorous...though Jura tries her best to make it so.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing armor,Yes, we're pirates...I try not to bring it up.  Jura sees it as a point of bragging rights.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing armor,I try to keep my piracy private unless asked.  You never know what someone's reaction will be...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing armor,The only other people we typically interact with would kill us for being pirates...so I try not to bring it up.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing armor,Maybe I'll feel better...after I win, and we leave.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing armor,We'll see how I feel, but this night's not off to a good start.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing armor,Don't worry about how I feel.  You do your job, and then you report back.  That's it.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing armor,We should be about even now...<i>that's</i> not making me feel better.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing armor,<i>Give it a rest</i>.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing armor,...I can't stay mad at you when you're actually showing genuine concern.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing armor,At least you're not making fun of it...so there's more to you than just flirting with passersby.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing armor,Maybe I <i>am</i> all pent-up in this armor.  Can't focus...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=losing armor,Yes.  I command the Nirvana's Dread squadron.  This armor signifies such.  ...Why is that so surprising, Misato?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=losing armor,Yes.  It's...interesting, to say the least.  But dangerous, hence the armor.  ...Is that <i>another</i> similarity, Misato?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=losing armor,I command the Nirvana's Dread pilots, actually.  That's why I have this armor, to signify that.  ...And apparently, Misato finds <i>this</i> thrilling as well.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing armor,...I'm not from Earth, Ochako.  You shouldn't assume I know what these things mean.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing armor,...What's a Quirk?  Some Earth way of introducing yourself?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing armor,That eyepiece is just decorative.  And what's that about a Quirk?  I'm not from this planet...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing armor,I prefer when people <i>don't</i> ask about my eyepiece, actually.  Mind explaining what a Quirk is?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing armor,...Whatever a "Quirk" is, I assure you my eyepiece has nothing to do with it.


#losing bodysuit
2-stripped=stretching,That armor deflects lasers...but not cards.
2-stripped=stretching,Ah.  There, I can breathe better now.
2-stripped=calm,It's useful for flying, but this is different.
2-stripped=happy,You know, that's the same armor Gascogne gave me when I became a squadron leader...
2-stripped=stretching,Feeling freer, but here that's a bad thing...
2-stripped=addressing,Don't think you'll push me any further.
2-stripped=stretching,I didn't pick that out.  Standard-issue for Dread team leaders.  Valore has one, too.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=annoyed,Well, unlike Jura, I have responsibilities...and no time for exhibitionism.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=unimpressed,Jura was the one to drag me here.  She's convinced stripping in front of strangers is going to make me go easier on her.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=addressing,<i>Friends</i> is a strong word.  Occasionally Jura surprises me and does her job, though, which is always nice.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=stretching,Well, Jura actually <i>wants</i> to be here, and felt it proper to drag me along.  She's convinced all of Earth will fall for her.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,Are you paying me compliments because you want time off of the next patrol duty?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Nice try buttering me up, but I won't forget how you dragged me here.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Coming from <i>you</i>...I'm not sure if those compliments mean anything.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,If you're expecting compliments in return, you don't need any.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=addressing,...Glad you appreciate it.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=addressing,...Well, it's nice to have a fan.  Thank you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=addressing,Funny.  Normally being a pilot creates <i>enemies</i> for me.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=bored,Well, I don't do it for fun.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,A lot of women's lives are in my hands when I pilot.  I take it seriously.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=addressing,...Is that an example of the android's trademark evasion?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=smug,As in, evading the subject?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=smug,I see.  Good job evading the conversation.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=pleased,...Speaking of evasion, yes, let's continue playing.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:unaware_mast=addressing,If you think I'll be masturbating tonight, then men are dumber than I thought.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:unaware_mast=addressing,Don't count on it.  You don't seem too spectacular at cards for all your talk.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:unaware_mast=addressing,As if I'd lose to a man.  Don't count on it.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,I <i>am</i> feeling a little better.  Better enough to finally beat you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,You sound cocky, Jura.  You should know better...I've never lost to you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,I <i>do</i> enjoy stretching myself out.  Losing that armor may have been good...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=pleased,That armor always reminds me of when Gascogne gave it to me...perhaps I'll channel her poker skills.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,Since we're so even, Jura...I'd say it's time to show me what you're made of.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,I may be getting into this a little, despite my reservations...this is all your fault.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,Don't think I'm going to strip naked for you, Jura.  Can't let my subordinates' respect for me slip.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,Don't think it's going to get easier from here.  Nudity is one thing...but I <i>hate</i> losing.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,Well, surely a bodysuit is intimidating just for its garishness.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,From what I can tell, Earth women dress more conservatively than Mejarians...so my bodysuit probably offends some sensibilities regardless.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,I don't need to make any friends here.  A crewmate hanging around is enough.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,We're not going to see these people again.  Whatever impression we make is irrelevant.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,Considering our first impressions of <i>Earth</i>, I can live with being seen as a threat.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,People's first impressions of us tend to come from us stealing and killing, so I fail to see the issue.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,...No, you're not.  Mejare is populated only by women, and we're satisfied with that.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=awkward,...I wouldn't say I'm <i>into</i> men.  I was raised to believe they were violent animals.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,...Mejare is a planet of all women.  So no, I haven't been with a man.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=confused,...<i>Into</i> guys?  I thought men inserted their things into <i>women</i>.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,True.  Now I've got more room to finish you off.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,Well, since I'm so limber now, I've got half a mind to shut up a certain loudmouthed crewmate of mine.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I'm feeling fine now...so I suggest you watch out.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=stretching,Much better...sometimes you have good ideas, Jura.  I suppose you're a decent second-in-command, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,I <i>do</i> feel better now.  Try coming up with some other good ideas the next time you're in your Dread.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,I'll be honest.  I mostly wear it out of respect for Gascgone.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,We really haven't done much pirating in a while.  I suppose a common enemy will do that to you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,We haven't raided anyone in a while.  Must be the men making us soft.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,Pirating has become pretty secondary these days, hasn't it?  Even Mejare and Tarak are coming around.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,She's just going to keep going on like this.  Pay no attention to her.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,See what I have to deal with every day?  There's a reason I don't smile much.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,Mm-hm.  I see.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Don't listen to anything she says...this is just going to continue until she finishes.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Not everyone is as vain as you are just because you've convinced yourself as such.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=stretching,It's not you being here.  She talks this way to me on the ship, too.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,<i>Vanity</i>...you have no right to call anyone <i>vain</i>.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,You calling me vain is like a star calling a flashlight bright.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,I don't need it here.  This is supposed to be friendly.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=annoyed,If you lived on Mejare, you'd steal, too.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,You have to earn it.  Isn't that the <i>point</i> of this game?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:unaware_mast=confused,Forfeit?  What are you talking about?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:unaware_mast=disappointed,...Whatever this "forfeit" is, I don't like the sound of it.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:unaware_mast=disappointed,I'm limber with the armor <i>on</i>.  It'd be useless otherwise.  And what's that about a forfeit?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,As if I'd buy a sudden interest in our practice schedule.  Just focus on the game.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,If you beat me, Jura, I'll let you show up five minutes late.  Maybe.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,Just the usual fare.  Vigilance is more important than creativity.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Normally I'd have that planned out, but you dragged me here and made me stare at your breasts, so I'm little distracted.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,What's that supposed to mean?  Does she wear the same suit underneath armor?  ...Part of me wants to meet her now.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,Feel free to list every similarity with this "Rei," Misato.  You've got me curious now.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stretching,This "Rei" sounds like a woman I'd get along with.  Send her over here next time.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,It's a rare woman that people consider similar to me...in my experience.  Now I want to meet this "Rei" of yours.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stretching,Made of?  I'm not sure...I'm more concerned with the protection it provides, mostly from Mejarian laser rings.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stretching,I don't know...it's standard issue, and was given to me when I took command of my Dread squadron.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=bored,It's not much as battle armor...mostly there for protection during flight.  Not sure about the materials, either.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=disappointed,I don't know the materials...I just take what's given to me.  That's not <i>your</i> armor, is it?  You're barely covered.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,...I've never considered myself special, especially not by how I was born.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=annoyed,<i>Born</i> with?  A woman's worth isn't a matter of the circumstances of her birth.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,<i>Born</i> with?  I put more stock in what women do with their lives than in how their lives begin.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,Being a pirate teaches you that most people aren't very special, actually.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=annoyed,I'm a woman like any other.  Perhaps these "Quirks" are exclusive to Earth...using the harvested organs of its colonies.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=disappointed,I'd like to be the arbiter of that, thank you.  I'm my own person.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=thinking,...I'll take your word for it that it is.  Sounds like I'd get along with this woman.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=bored,Never saw myself as having much in common with others, but apparently there's an Earth woman I'm <i>very</i> similar to.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=bored,I feel like I've been captured on Tarak and displayed in a cage...who <i>is</i> this mystery woman?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_headset=confused,...You're familiar with Mejarian armor?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_headset=confused,...What exactly has made you familiar with Mejarian flightsuit armor?
2-must_strip_winning=bored,Seems my advantage has led to a false sense of security...
2-must_strip_winning=annoyed,Well, since I enjoyed losing my armor so much...
2-must_strip_winning=thinking,Serves me right for playing sloppy...
2-must_strip_winning=annoyed,I'm mad, but only at myself.
2-must_strip_winning=annoyed,Overconfidence...Hibiki is rubbing off on me.
2-must_strip_winning=disappointed,...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=disappointed,Sorry to disappoint, Sei, but I wear underwear.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,No, it's not.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,Unlike my crewmates, Sei, I actually wear underwear.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Yes, my suit's next.  Probably a little more stimulating...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,After the show you just gave them, I don't see why losing my bodysuit would turn any heads.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,What's the big deal?  You just <i>masturbated</i> for everyone.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,I <i>could</i> try to be sexy about it, but you've made that a moot point.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,Wouldn't you rather masturbate to someone you <i>don't</i> have to work with the next day?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I hope you're just teasing.  Think of your girlfriend...or one of these Earth people, if you must.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I'm doing my best to ignore how awkward this is, but you can't help but shoot that down...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=annoyed,I would never lose on purpose...<i>especially</i> to help you masturbate.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=disappointed,I don't think I'm going to top what you've already revealed.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,At least you've absorbed most of the embarrassment already...and you're <i>immune</i> to embarrassment.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,You're right, my suit's next...enjoy my pallid complexion.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,I keep on making mistakes...and my subordinate's not exactly in a better position.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,I suppose your breasts must be making me subconsciously want to strip, too.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Trust me, I'm not <i>trying</i> to catch up to you.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Luckily, I'm not totally bare after this...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,The last thing I want is to be nude.  This is <i>your</i> arena, not mine.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,Why do you want to strip so badly, anyway?  Is Barnette's approval not enough for you?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,At least I'm actually <i>stripping</i>.  You've done nothing but tease so far.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,You're outplaying me, but only from loading up on accessories ahead of time.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,Forgive me for not being impressed.  All you've done to stay in this game is come with a stock of small things.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=unimpressed,Surprised you didn't bring your entire jewelry closet and win by default.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=unimpressed,Seems you're taking me on an odyssey all by yourself.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=disappointed,<i>Home</i> console?  Consoles are for ship controls...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,And it's your favorite, I assume?  Can we maybe skip to whatever <i>is</i>?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,This is quite the odyssey of video game trivia...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,You're a lot more thrilled about it than I am.  Do men really like women that much?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Perfect...there goes my suit.  Yes, 9S, I noticed I lost.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=unimpressed,I see that "combat visor" of yours can spot the weakest hand.  Clearly human eyes pale in comparison.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,People always mistake seriousness for shyness.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,I'm told I have a nice smile, actually.  So I try to use it sparingly.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=bored,...What's so special about my suit?  Standard material...it's a style on Mejare.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,It's just a bodysuit.  Nothing to be jealous about...unless there's something I should know about you.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,I just wear it for comfort and efficiency.  They must exist on Earth, right?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,My suit?  Well, I'm out of other options.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,If you're guessing my suit, which you seem to be by your embarrassment, then yes.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=stretching,Yes, my bodysuit.  Do you see anything smaller?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,I made a mistake, and I'm paying the price for it.  So the suit has to go.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,It's no issue to take off the suit, Ochako.  I wear underwear.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=bored,...
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,You'll be losing soon enough, judging by your attitude.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,I don't know, Jura...I don't see any accessories left on your person.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,As far as I can tell, that choker was the last of your defenses.  So I'm not worried.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,Do me a favor and take off your dress all at once next time you lose...just so I can say you have a shred of sportmanship.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,Again?  Damn...
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,I must have needed that armor...
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,You've smelled blood, it seems...
2-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,I lost with <i>that</i>?  I'm getting overconfident.
2-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,<i>That</i> lost?  I can't argue with that kind of skill.
2-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I'm surprised that lost.  You're better than you've been letting on.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,It doesn't.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,Nothing makes my breasts look good.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,At least I held it together for a while...
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,My streak comes to an end.
2-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,That streak <i>did</i> give me a lead...
2-must_strip_normal=bored,...
2-must_strip_normal=annoyed,Maybe this game is a Harvest plot to not have to sort clothes from organs.
2-must_strip_normal=bored,I'm not concentrating...I didn't think the stripping would be so distracting.
2-must_strip_normal=annoyed,I shouldn't be losing this much...
2-must_strip_normal=bored,Still hanging with the pack, but I'm used to being out in front.
2-must_strip_normal=bored,At least this will let my body breathe even more.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,People always mistake seriousness for shyness.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,I'm told I have a nice smile, actually.  So I try to use it sparingly.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:futaba=bored,...What's so special about my suit?  Standard material...it's a style on Mejare.

2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,At least you've absorbed most of the embarrassment already...and you're <i>immune</i> to embarrassment.

2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,Wouldn't you rather masturbate to someone you <i>don't</i> have to work with the next day?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I hope you're just teasing.  Think of your girlfriend...or one of these Earth people, if you must.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I'm doing my best to ignore how awkward this is, but you can't help but shoot that down...
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=annoyed,I would never lose on purpose...<i>especially</i> to help you masturbate.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,You'll be losing soon enough, judging by your attitude.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,I don't know, Jura...I don't see any accessories left on your person.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,As far as I can tell, that choker was the last of your defenses.  So I'm not worried.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,Do me a favor and take off your dress all at once next time you lose...just so I can say you have a shred of sportmanship.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,At least I'm actually <i>stripping</i>.  You've done nothing but tease so far.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,You're outplaying me, but only from loading up on accessories ahead of time.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,Forgive me for not being impressed.  All you've done to stay in this game is come with a stock of small things.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=unimpressed,Surprised you didn't bring your entire jewelry closet and win by default.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Yes, my suit's next.  Probably a little more stimulating...
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,After the show you just gave them, I don't see why losing my bodysuit would turn any heads.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,What's the big deal?  You just <i>masturbated</i> for everyone.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,I <i>could</i> try to be sexy about it, but you've made that a moot point.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=bored,...
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,It doesn't.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,Nothing makes my breasts look good.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Excuse me for wearing what I always do as you drag me into a game I didn't want to play.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=disappointed,You're not working with much yourself.  If you weren't a cheat, you'd probably be naked now.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Just the Mejarian way to go without much clothing, I suppose...compare us to these Earth women.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=pleased,At least my suit covers skin...but then, your dress hides your figure.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,This is usually around the point where you'd get cocky...and you know what happens after that.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,Don't sell yourself short, Jura.  You rose to second-in-command by yourself...you're smart.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,This sort of self-degradation is why you're still only second-in-command.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,If I don't give myself credit for my body, well...you don't give yourself credit for your poker skills.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=disappointed,Sorry to disappoint, Sei, but I wear underwear.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,No, it's not.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,Unlike my crewmates, Sei, I actually wear underwear.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,You're doing very well, Jura.  Just remember who's always won our games.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,I'd rather you praise yourself than put others down, but do as you wish.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,No sense talking back.  I'm impressed you're outplaying me.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=disappointed,I'd tell you to keep that smug attitude in check, but it's the only attitude you have.
2-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=bored,I lost with <i>that</i>?  I'm getting overconfident.
2-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,<i>That</i> lost?  I can't argue with that kind of skill.
2-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I'm surprised that lost.  You're better than you've been letting on.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=unimpressed,Seems you're taking me on an odyssey all by yourself.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=disappointed,<i>Home</i> console?  Consoles are for ship controls...
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,And it's your favorite, I assume?  Can we maybe skip to whatever <i>is</i>?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=bored,This is quite the odyssey of video game trivia...
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Well, there goes all my layers.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,No excuses...just mistakes.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Once again...but that'll be it.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=annoyed,Caught me slipping...
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=annoyed,I needed that streak.  I only wear so much.
2-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=annoyed,Damn.  I was doing well, too.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,You're a lot more thrilled about it than I am.  Do men really like women that much?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,Perfect...there goes my suit.  Yes, 9S, I noticed I lost.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=unimpressed,I see that "combat visor" of yours can spot the weakest hand.  Clearly human eyes pale in comparison.
2-must_strip_losing=bored,Jura might look like she wears less than I do...but she's got trinkets everywhere.
2-must_strip_losing=bored,Gascogne taught me better than this...
2-must_strip_losing=annoyed,Perhaps part of me <i>wants</i> to lose deep down.
2-must_strip_losing=thinking,I'm feeling fat...
2-must_strip_losing=angry,I'm more than capable of clawing my way back.
2-must_strip_losing=annoyed,...
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime=unimpressed,Seems you're taking me on an odyssey all by yourself.

2-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I'm surprised that lost.  You're better than you've been letting on.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Poker is a dangerous game...I'm losing, and fast.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Just sad...
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Normally I'm better than this.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,It doesn't.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=bored,Nothing makes my breasts look good.

2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,Wouldn't you rather masturbate to someone you <i>don't</i> have to work with the next day?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I hope you're just teasing.  Think of your girlfriend...or one of these Earth people, if you must.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I'm doing my best to ignore how awkward this is, but you can't help but shoot that down...
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=annoyed,I would never lose on purpose...<i>especially</i> to help you masturbate.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=annoyed,I had a good run, but I'm still losing.
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I had a streak, but it hasn't helped much...
2-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Perhaps I'll have another run like that with the pressure on...
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,At least I'm actually <i>stripping</i>.  You've done nothing but tease so far.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,You're outplaying me, but only from loading up on accessories ahead of time.

2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,People always mistake seriousness for shyness.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,I'm told I have a nice smile, actually.  So I try to use it sparingly.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:futaba=bored,...What's so special about my suit?  Standard material...it's a style on Mejare.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,It's just a bodysuit.  Nothing to be jealous about...unless there's something I should know about you.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:futaba=disappointed,I just wear it for comfort and efficiency.  They must exist on Earth, right?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,My suit?  Well, I'm out of other options.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,If you're guessing my suit, which you seem to be by your embarrassment, then yes.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=stretching,Yes, my bodysuit.  Do you see anything smaller?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,I made a mistake, and I'm paying the price for it.  So the suit has to go.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,It's no issue to take off the suit, Ochako.  I wear underwear.
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,Excuse me for wearing what I always do as you drag me into a game I didn't want to play.

2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Off comes the whole suit.  You're proving to be better than I thought.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,So I'm out of my suit.  You could already tell what my body looked like anyway.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Don't think you've won.  I <i>do</i> wear underwear.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Now I'm going to get <i>serious</i>.
2-stripping=losing bodysuit,Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_bodysuit=losing bodysuit,Being sure doesn't mean you're correct.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_bodysuit=losing bodysuit,Naked under a bodysuit?  That's just indecent.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_bodysuit,marker:hi-tech_dread=losing bodysuit,My <i>Dread</i> is advanced...nothing about <i>me</i> needs to be.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_bodysuit,marker:wearing_tech=losing bodysuit,No, it's not.  Technology is for using, not wearing.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_bodysuit,marker:armor_lasers=losing bodysuit,...My armor deflects lasers.  That's about the extent of it.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bodysuit,If you want an example of my generosity, I'd say my agreeing to come here fits the bill.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bodysuit,Yes, all at once.  I don't know how you'd count it as anything else.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bodysuit,I hardly even own a shirt and pants, so my options were limited anyway.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bodysuit,What else do I even own?  A sundress and a swimsuit...they wouldn't fare any better.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bodysuit,I think they can tell neither of us wears much clothing.  It's just how Mejare is...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bodysuit,I suppose my outfit <i>does</i> put me at a disadvantage here...but challenges are good.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bodysuit,I suppose when you don't wear much here, it puts all the attention on you...that's true in general, really.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bodysuit,I guess this scant outfit makes me a pushover in this game, doesn't it?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:139=losing bodysuit,Do you mean me losing, or your own masturbation?  I thought that was over.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:139=losing bodysuit,It's a little late for that to matter to you, Pit.  Or can men do it again?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:139=losing bodysuit,Your masturbation, you mean?  I thought you were finished.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:139=losing bodysuit,Living vicariously through the remaining players, Pit?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:139=losing bodysuit,Do you mean me losing, or your own masturbation?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:139=losing bodysuit,It's a little late for that to matter to you, Pit.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:139=losing bodysuit,Your masturbation, you mean?  I suppose men can appreciate a woman in her underwear.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:6,priority:139=losing bodysuit,Living vicariously through the remaining players, Pit?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,priority:139=losing bodysuit,It's slim and efficient.  Being one piece is only a detriment <i>here</i>.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,priority:139=losing bodysuit,I really doubt you have what it takes to strip me further, Pit.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,priority:139=losing bodysuit,It's decently comfortable, actually.  Shame about that being a flaw here.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,priority:139=losing bodysuit,My underwear isn't easy to pry off of me.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=losing bodysuit,You have the sharp eyes a soldier needs, Sei.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=losing bodysuit,Very observant, Sei.  I can see why the White Knights picked you.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing bodysuit,My--<i>boyfriend</i>?  Gascogne is the <i>woman</i> who runs our weapons systems, and I have nothing but respect for her.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing bodysuit,Gascogne is a <i>woman</i>, and the Nirvana's quartermaster.  And my respect for her runs deeper than infatuation.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing bodysuit,Wha--as if I'd have a <i>boyfriend</i>.  Gasocgne is the woman who serves as the Nirvana's quartermaster, and I show her respect.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=losing bodysuit,...Gascogne is a <i>woman's</i> name, and the brave woman who runs our weapons systems.  Don't set me up with <i>men</i>.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bodysuit,I have admirers, do I?  Well, they'll have to stay that way.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bodysuit,I have a hard time believing any of that.  What's your evidence, my surprise birthday parties?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bodysuit,Is that a fact?  Well, it's good to be loved...and I appreciate the service to the crew.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bodysuit,I'll keep that in mind...but it's best to stay professional.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bodysuit,I'd rather stay professional with crewmates.  I know from Barnette that you don't agree...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bodysuit,I really can't tell if you're being serious or not...I'll assume the latter for my own sanity.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bodysuit,Do whatever it takes for you to finish quickly.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bodysuit,If this'll help you finish faster, I suppose it's all for the best.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bodysuit,At least this'll help my skin breathe.  Masturbate to the sweat on the suit if you're going to be all depraved.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia3=losing bodysuit,I'd like to be bought separately right about now...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia3=losing bodysuit,Not much of a trivia piece if both situations are applicable.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia3=losing bodysuit,Weren't you sleepy before?  What happened to <i>that</i>?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia3=losing bodysuit,This is the last time I make small talk with an Earth woman about her hobbies...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:trivia3=losing bodysuit,Serves me right for faking interest to be polite...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bodysuit,Of course I wear underwear.  Wouldn't want this suit rubbing against me all day...I'd chafe.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bodysuit,I'm surprised <i>you</i> wear underwear, frankly.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bodysuit,Everyone's always so surprised I wear underwear with this suit on.  I'm not some...<i>harlot</i>.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bodysuit,I wear this suit for ease of use, not sex appeal...so yes, I have underwear on.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bodysuit,I suppose no underwear beneath would make for a good reveal, wouldn't it?  Shame.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing bodysuit,What?  Of course I do...that'd be indecent.  I don't <i>want</i> to be here, you know.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing bodysuit,Of course I wear underwear.  It'd probably be uncomfortable otherwise...I've never tried.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing bodysuit,I don't want this suit rubbing up against anything sensitive.  I wear underwear.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing bodysuit,I wear underwear.  Don't take me for some kind of...pervert.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=losing bodysuit,I know the suit is revealing, but it's merely a price I pay for comfort.  I wear things underneath.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing bodysuit,And what exactly is the <i>Metaverse</i>?  Some planet I should know about?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing bodysuit,And where is this <i>Metaverse</i> planet?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba,marker:bodysuit=losing bodysuit,You wear a bodysuit?  You're so small it would seem irrelevant.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bodysuit,Give it a rest already.  They're here to see <i>you</i> strip.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bodysuit,I just have the zipper in front to make it easier...it's not meant to be sex appeal.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bodysuit,Yes, it all comes off at once...think nothing of it.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bodysuit,What good would a bodysuit be if I had to struggle with a back-zipper?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bodysuit,Of course it comes on and off easily.  I can't waste time fiddling with it when it's time to scramble.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bodysuit,I'll just strip and let you keep talking...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bodysuit,Luck or not, I lost...so it's time for my suit.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bodysuit,There's strategy in everything, right down to reading your opponent's face...I suppose I'm not very good at that.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bodysuit,Poker is a game about reading people...at least this game gives you more of them to look at.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bodysuit,Have some patience, Jura...seems as if nudity comes to us all, here.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bodysuit,Normally I'd say I was sizing up the enemy, but you'd see right through that...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bodysuit,I could definitely be playing better, but don't forget you're outdoing everyone else, too.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bodysuit,Perhaps your cheerful indifference is really just <i>another</i> kind of poker face.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing bodysuit,Who said I was complaining?  Though I don't share your love of piracy.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing bodysuit,You sound like you pirate for <i>fun</i>.  We just need supplies Mejarian officials tend to keep for themselves.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=losing bodysuit,You seem uncomfortable with my suit, Steve.  It's just standard-issue material.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=losing bodysuit,It's all one piece, but not wearing underwear underneath would be indecent.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=losing bodysuit,It's just a bodysuit, Steve.  <i>You</i> wear one.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bodysuit,That <i>does</i> sound like something I had half a mind to say.  You're sharp...for a man.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bodysuit,She wears a <i>dress</i>?  I thought you engaged in combat...then again, Jura dresses like that for flying.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bodysuit,What good is a <i>dress</i> in combat?  She can't be that similar to me if <i>that's</i> what she wears.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bodysuit,I see all that data of yours is picking up on my speech patterns.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bodysuit,Not a bad imitation of what <i>I'd</i> say.  I'd like to meet this woman...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bodysuit,So, all the same, you have experience stripping in front of people, then?  I don't see the issue.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bodysuit,I'm more concerned with losing than with what anyone thinks of my nude body.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bodysuit,Is there a reason you're trying to sell me to everyone here?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bodysuit,I'm sure everyone's enjoying your commentary.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bodysuit,Never knew you'd want talk me up so much in mixed company.  Do you need a favor?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bodysuit,...You're going to ask a favor when this is over, aren't you?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bodysuit,Just ignore her...I don't dress to impress.


#losing bra
3-stripped=stretching,I really should have worn a more elaborate outfit...
3-stripped=annoyed,This is what I get for just hurrying over here in my flightsuit.
3-stripped=bored,I should have worn more clothing...not that I own very much.
3-stripped=stretching,No sense wearing anything but training gear underneath the flightsuit.
3-stripped=stretching,We call this training gear, though it's really glorified underwear...
3-stripped=thinking,I wasn't exactly hiding my body anyway.
3-stripped=pleased,Now I'm dressed like Barnette is all the time.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:0-0=impressed,...You really <i>are</i> just like Jura.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Teasing?  Right out of Jura's playbook.  Only reason she came here, I'm sure.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:0-0=addressing,<i>Cute</i>, was it?  I'll always take support over looks.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:1-1=disappointed,By all means, Ami, if you want this man, you can have him.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:1-1=addressing,The day I dress up for a man's sake is the day I want the captain to put me out of my misery.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:1-1=addressing,If I were to ever date a man, I <i>hope</i> he'd have the good sense to appreciate supportive training gear.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=disappointed,What are you on about <i>now</i>?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=bored,...One person sober and one drunk doesn't make for good conversation.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Phased weaponry is definitely one of Mejare's strong points.  Men's kinetic weapons are racketous and clunky.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america=disappointed,What's wrong with my underwear?  Haven't you <i>been</i> with women before?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america=disappointed,You're talking like you've never been with a woman.  I thought Earth men and women were all over each other.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america=disappointed,Surely an <i>Earth</i> man has seen women naked before.  Underwear should be no issue for you.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:2-3=pleased,Even Jura would hesitate to tease <i>this</i> many men...I hope.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:2-3=disappointed,Are you sure you want to tease men like this?  They tend to be much stronger than women.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:3,totalMales:2-3=addressing,I paid enough attention to choose underwear that's both supportive and sensible.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,I have no issue with standing in my underwear.  It's quite supportive.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Uncomfortable with your body, Elaine?  I happen to <i>like</i> my underwear.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,...Thank you, Elizabeth.  You're a sweet girl...even if I disagree.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Couldn't you see what my figure was like already?  My suit doesn't exactly obscure it.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,I've never considered myself beautiful.  I try to look presentable, exercising all the time...but muscles aren't beautiful.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching,I've usually aimed for function over beauty, actually.  Maybe I'm not working hard enough...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,That's the nicest way someone's ever put it, actually.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=pleased,That sounds like how <i>Dita</i> might describe my suit.  Sometimes she's almost painfully cheerful.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=pleased,I've never been in a good enough mood to put it that way, but I suppose.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:kira=disappointed,...Why are you staring at me like that, Kira?  Never seen a woman before?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:kira=disappointed,...What about my hands?  They're like any other woman's.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:kira=confused,You...like women's <i>hands</i>?  Is that common among men?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:kira=stretching,Never thought my <i>hands</i> would constitute some sort of dramatic reveal.  Men are full of surprises.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stretching,You sound surprised.  Not sure I want to see this NERV organization for myself.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,Can't believe you thought otherwise.  Earth women really <i>are</i> vulgar.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,Your surprised tone tells me all I need to know about Earth women's decency.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,What's your interest in bodysuits, anyway?  This is just a Mejarian style...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I <i>know</i> it works.  It serves me well in the gym.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I prefer function over form in my clothing.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I doubt a man would understand the importance of breast support in training gear.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=unimpressed,Excellent show of confidence.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,No use going back on your words when you seemed so committed to them to begin with.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,...Next time, bring this "2B" here instead.  She sounds interesting.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,I admit, you're playing much better than me.  But I'm not finished yet.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,Don't start your gloating just yet, Ami.  I'm a long way from defeat.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,Keep up that smug attitude while you can, Ami.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,I feel perfectly comfortable in my underwear.  Let's see if you do, too.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Not particularly, no.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Masturbation is a private activity...this place is disgusting.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Good to hear you're having fun, Ami.  I can't say the same.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:2=disappointed,...I don't know what that means.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:2=confused,...What's a "selfie"?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,Whatever this "selfie" is, it sounds sexual.  So yes, let's wait a bit.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=addressing,My heart is hard to reach.  Some have done it, though.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=addressing,In the vacuum of space.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=addressing,I think the ability to be restrained is what makes us human, actually.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,I'd say you ruined the mystery when you started groping yourself.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,What's there to wonder about?  We're all just human in the end.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=stretching,There's no exoticism about us...we're just normal women.  Best to stay humble.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,Best not to seem alien to people we're trying to extend an olive branch to.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,It's not as if Mejare gets much sunlight...we're even worse, always hiding out in its orbiting debris.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,I hear pale skin is popular in some circles...best to stay away from them, then.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,marker:oma_and_fama=stretching,My Oma wanted my skin to be pale.  I never spent much time outside as a girl...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,If you're going to compliment anything, I actually <i>worked</i> for my abdominal muscles.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Why do <i>you</i> feel the need to dress so provocatively?  You <i>have</i> a girlfriend...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,I prefer clothes that can be used for multiple purposes.  <i>Practical</i> purposes.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,I happen to like the gym, so I dress prepared for it.  You'd be surprised how fulfilling exercise can be.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,Didn't you <i>know</i> I wear this?  I figured you stared at me intently as I undressed for the showers...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,I'll wear whatever I please.  If you were a better poker player, maybe you could say the same.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,Perhaps if you wore a bra, both of us standing in our underwear might mean something.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,Now that I think about it, you could use a bra...my breasts aren't much, and I still like the support.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,That my underwear matches my hair is the closest I come to fashionable.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,You flatter me, Jura.  I suppose that means you want something.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I'd like to see <i>you</i> exercise for once.  You've only ever sweat in the sauna...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=stretching,Barnette would probably find you more attractive if you exercised.  Give it a try sometime.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I can see why you don't exercise too, Jura.  Exercising requires an honest effort.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=disappointed,I hope you're not trying to set me up with any of these people.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,Uh...thank you, Rinkah.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,I try to exercise regularly...I have to stay fit in order to pilot effectively.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stretching,Exercise is important...I have to set an example for the pilots in my squadron.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=disappointed,You don't need to compliment me...you're in better shape than I am.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stretching,Thank you.  But clearly I could learn from <i>your</i> training, Rinkah.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,This is a waste of my time, so it'd be rude of me to waste others'.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=stretching,Stripping the suit in pieces would be cheating.  It's all one item...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,Should've known you'd just tease everyone instead of stripping.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,You're not going to lose your nerve when <i>you</i> have to show skin, right?  That'd be embarrassing...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,Function is always better over form...but I'm sure you have a different underwear philosophy.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,What did you think I wore, <i>lingerie</i>?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,I'm disappointed you expected anything else.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,They're sensible.  Perfect to sleep in following exercise.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,You've got nothing but a thong, I'm sure.  Well, to each her own.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,Don't think patronizing me is going to get you out of flight practice.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,Looks fade, Jura.  You need to spend time in the gym, or you'll lose your figure.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,That figure's not going to last forever if you don't maintain it, Jura.  I don't think Barnette will love you anymore if that happens...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=stretching,Muscles last a lot longer than fat.  I suggest you start exercising...it'll teach you discipline.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=disappointed,You'll have to forgive me for thinking your compliments are a little disingenuous.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,You're not so much complimenting me as bragging about the people you associate with.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,Beauty is subjective...so I just aim for fitness.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,Fitness at least has a practical use...whatever beauty comes from it is just a byproduct.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:9,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,Actually, Mejare is obsessed with fashion.  So was I...when I was little.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:9=disappointed,Mejare pays lip service to exercise, but most of its focus is on fashion, actually.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:9=disappointed,I've never given popular Mejarian opinion much weight.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=disappointed,If you're anything to go by, time on Earth would <i>not</i> warm me up.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=disappointed,The last thing I need is to be surrounded by lecherous Earth men.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=addressing,<i>Ice cold</i>?  Thanks for the compliment.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,Why would I wear anything else?  Exercise is important.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Jura dragged me here.  I wasn't about to dress for the occasion...if I even <i>had</i> something sexy.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,You shouldn't be so dismissive of exercise.  Your looks will fade if you don't maintain your body.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6=disappointed,...Why?  I don't need anything.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,I haven't been shopping in a <i>very</i> long time.  What we need, we steal.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,I haven't shopped in ages.  It all goes to the state on Mejare anyway...always peddling new frivolous fashions.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Thanks for the offer, Ami, but I don't have any money.  Not that I even know what Earth money looks like.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6=disappointed,Shopping on Earth <i>does</i> sound enlightening, but I have no money.  We steal what we need and leave it at that.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6=disappointed,...Is there something wrong with my underwear?  I don't need to buy anything.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I don't <i>want</i> to catch up.  My skills just aren't up to par, apparently.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,You're very attractive, Ami, but not to the point where I could understand this constant self-aggrandizement.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,You sound just like Jura...but to Jura's credit, she's tall and voluptuous.  By Mejarian standards, you're merely attractive.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,Humility is a virtue, Ami.  At least, I heard it was on <i>Earth</i>.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,Sounds like something Jura would say.  Not that I understand Earth men's tastes, but I'd say Jura's body is better.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,Jura considers herself perfect, too...and in a Mejarian's opinion, she's a lot closer to it than you, Ami.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,My body certainly isn't perfect, but I do what I can to maintain it.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,A perfect body is the Mejarian ideal.  Of course, that's actually so the Harvest gets a good product...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,Mejarians are taught to be proud of their bodies...provided we take pride in them, so to speak.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Was that a mocking tone?  I don't see what's wrong with my underwear.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,<i>Interesting</i>?  Not the word I'd use, but then it seems like you're just mocking me anyway,
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,I'm a pirate.  My choices of underwear are only so diverse.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stretching,It's sleek and efficient.  I don't care if it shows off my body...that's par for the course where I'm from.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stretching,Mejarian fashion tends to be revealing.  At least a bodysuit had the benefit of practicality.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,I'm not ashamed of my body.  The suit is comfortable for the function it provides, so I can live with being exposed.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,I lead a squadron of gossiping pilots.  I'm constantly under a microscope anyway...whether my body is exposed or not is of little concern.
3-must_strip_winning=disappointed,Since I'm winning, I guess I shouldn't feel bad about this...
3-must_strip_winning=bored,Looks like I'm joining the club.
3-must_strip_winning=addressing,Some nudity from me at last.  Proud of yourself?
3-must_strip_winning=bored,Mejarian breasts aren't all that different, I assure you.
3-must_strip_winning=annoyed,Get ready to be blown away...
3-must_strip_winning=bored,I actually beat Gascogne once...she had a headcold.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Immediately...
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Is it my turn again?
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Got me out of my bra before I knew what to make of you...
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Staved it off as long as I could...
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,The time has come at last.
3-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I'm winning, but...
3-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=interested,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough...you really <i>are</i> good.
3-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough for you?  I don't even feel bad about losing this hand.
3-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,Two pair couldn't beat you...so now you'll see one.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,"Comfortable" is probably the wrong word here, Ochako.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,I've never considered myself comfortable here...<i>indifferent</i>, at best.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,Maybe you <i>could</i> stand to gain some composure if me taking off my bra is so disconcerting to you.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,If you're reading annoyance as comfort, maybe you <i>do</i> need to take advice from me...
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Took you long enough to realize.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Is Earth not capable of space travel where you come from?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,You <i>are</i> in better shape than me, Sei..  Good to know you're capable of being disciplined.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,Your body <i>is</i> impressive, Sei.  Shame you insist on drinking it all away.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,You <i>are</i> in better shape than I expected, Sei...I like women with hidden depths.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pleased,<i>Sunshine</i>?  Tarak blocks Mejare's sun half the time...and we block theirs the other half.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,There's cuter bras on <i>Mejare</i>.  I wear this for support.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=addressing,It matches my hair.  That's cute enough, isn't it?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=pleased,Half my crewmates don't even wear bras.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Great...this is what you wanted from the start, wasn't it?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=pleased,At least we'll have solidarity in our indecency.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,There's no beating you, Jura.  Not here, when you win even when you lose.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,Should I even bother showing my breasts when you've already wowed the audience with yours?
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=unimpressed,I'm not going to make a scene, Jura.  You've <i>already</i> done that.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,I'm more embarrassed about my crewmate making a fool of herself, honestly.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,You're making a bigger deal of it than I am...
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,I'm just going to get this over with so you have nothing to comment on.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Damn...and with a certain crewmate leering at me.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I <i>cannot</i> believe you talked me into this game.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,Keep the colorful comments coming, Jura.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,I can hardly believe you're enjoying yourself this much.  I thought exposure would've been it for you...
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,I honestly thought you'd lose your nerve if you had to masturbate in public, but no...your vanity knows no bounds.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Well, looks like you've wrung nudity from <i>both</i> Nirvana crew members.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,Couldn't put it off forever.  Time for full nudity...
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Up until this point I've still been in outfits I've appeared in publicly...not anymore.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,At least I'm doing better than <i>you</i>, Jura...but I shouldn't take pleasure in defeating my crewmates.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,At least I'm doing better than <i>you</i>, Jura...but you don't mind losing, so that's not saying much.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,Surprised you didn't throw this hand to make sure you showed them first.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,You've just pulled ahead of me, Jura...I don't like being second place, just so you know.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I suppose by <i>your</i> standards, then, I'm still outplaying you as usual.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,I'm absolutely <i>thrilled</i> to get my breasts out ahead of you, if you couldn't tell.
3-must_strip_normal=thinking,I thought I'd have a lead at this point in the game...
3-must_strip_normal=bored,What's <i>wrong</i> with me tonight?
3-must_strip_normal=thinking,Maybe I should have come here in one of our clunky spacesuits.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,I may be a pirate, but I <i>do</i> follow rules.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,Damn it...I'm slipping.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,It's not the stripping I hate...it's the losing.
3-must_strip_normal=bored,I'll follow the rules.  Usually I'm making them.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Damn...and with a certain crewmate leering at me.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I <i>cannot</i> believe you talked me into this game.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,Keep the colorful comments coming, Jura.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,I can hardly believe you're enjoying yourself this much.  I thought exposure would've been it for you...
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,I honestly thought you'd lose your nerve if you had to masturbate in public, but no...your vanity knows no bounds.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=unimpressed,I'm not going to make a scene, Jura.  You've <i>already</i> done that.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,I'm more embarrassed about my crewmate making a fool of herself, honestly.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,You're making a bigger deal of it than I am...
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,I'm just going to get this over with so you have nothing to comment on.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=disappointed,There's cuter bras on <i>Mejare</i>.  I wear this for support.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=addressing,It matches my hair.  That's cute enough, isn't it?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=pleased,Half my crewmates don't even wear bras.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pleased,<i>Sunshine</i>?  Tarak blocks Mejare's sun half the time...and we block theirs the other half.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,You <i>are</i> in better shape than me, Sei..  Good to know you're capable of being disciplined.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,Your body <i>is</i> impressive, Sei.  Shame you insist on drinking it all away.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,You <i>are</i> in better shape than I expected, Sei...I like women with hidden depths.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,"Comfortable" is probably the wrong word here, Ochako.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,I've never considered myself comfortable here...<i>indifferent</i>, at best.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=disappointed,Maybe you <i>could</i> stand to gain some composure if me taking off my bra is so disconcerting to you.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,If you're reading annoyance as comfort, maybe you <i>do</i> need to take advice from me...
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Took you long enough to realize.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Is Earth not capable of space travel where you come from?
3-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=interested,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough...you really <i>are</i> good.
3-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=pleased,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough for you?  I don't even feel bad about losing this hand.
3-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,Two pair couldn't beat you...so now you'll see one.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Well, looks like you've wrung nudity from <i>both</i> Nirvana crew members.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,Couldn't put it off forever.  Time for full nudity...
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,Up until this point I've still been in outfits I've appeared in publicly...not anymore.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=bored,At least I'm doing better than <i>you</i>, Jura...but I shouldn't take pleasure in defeating my crewmates.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,At least I'm doing better than <i>you</i>, Jura...but you don't mind losing, so that's not saying much.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Alright...let's get this over with.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Fine, fine...I <i>was</i> winning for a while.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=annoyed,At least I prolonged my own anxiety.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,Great...this is what you wanted from the start, wasn't it?
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=pleased,At least we'll have solidarity in our indecency.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,There's no beating you, Jura.  Not here, when you win even when you lose.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,Should I even bother showing my breasts when you've already wowed the audience with yours?
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Damn it...I'm playing like a novice.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,A losing streak...I'm better than this.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,My strategy isn't working...got to adjust.
3-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=bored,Damn.  Thought I'd have more time to fret about this.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,Had you agreed to remove anything substantial, you'd have lost already.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,This is a sad performance I'm putting on.  At least I can say my subordinate has impressed me.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,From the looks of things, you're a lot closer to my level of clothing than you appear.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=bored,Damn...well, Jura, I'm not going to stand here and make excuses.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,Your outfit may have hidden depths, but I'm not sure about your mind.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,At least I have secrets in my mind, as well...unlike a certain crewmate of mine.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=disappointed,For all the layers of your outfit, you could do with being less forward about your intentions.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=pleased,You taking your boots off early is the only surprise you can muster, I figure.  The rest is just typical vanity wrapped in jewelry.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=unimpressed,I'm sure our Earth hosts find your dress mesmerizing.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,You're bringing all the Mejarian fashion we needed to show off.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,I was never interested in a fashion discussion in the first place.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,As far as I can tell, Earth fashion is just Mejarian fashion for colder weather.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=disappointed,I agree, I'm playing very badly...but you should acknowledge your own talent.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=pleased,Give yourself a little credit, Jura.  I didn't think you had the motivation to play cards this well.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,I'm just glad you're taking this seriously instead of throwing the game just to strip.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,I'm actually really impressed with how you've been playing.  If you beat me, maybe you deserve a promotion.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,Surprised you didn't throw this hand to make sure you showed them first.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,You've just pulled ahead of me, Jura...I don't like being second place, just so you know.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I suppose by <i>your</i> standards, then, I'm still outplaying you as usual.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,I'm absolutely <i>thrilled</i> to get my breasts out ahead of you, if you couldn't tell.
3-must_strip_losing=thinking,I've played shamefully, so it's time for me to be ashamed.
3-must_strip_losing=bored,...And no more breast support.  I could use some support right now...
3-must_strip_losing=thinking,I deserve this with how predictable I've been this game.
3-must_strip_losing=bored,Still not as bad as getting your district shut down...
3-must_strip_losing=stretching,Let's get this over with.
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Took you long enough to realize.
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Is Earth not capable of space travel where you come from?

3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Not the bra...and I was doing so well.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,...Not the bra.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Clearly you've gotten in my head...
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,You're in my head.  Now you'll reap the benefits.
3-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,I'm being too stubborn...
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Damn...and with a certain crewmate leering at me.

3-stripping=losing bra,Off comes the bra.  Don't expect much...
3-stripping=losing bra,And now, my decidedly mediocre chest...
3-stripping=losing bra,Now you'll see my breasts.  Are you satisfied, or will you push me further?
3-stripping=losing bra,Give me a second...this thing isn't meant to come off easily.
3-stripping=losing bra,For your sake, I hope you weren't looking forward to this...
3-stripping=losing bra,...
3-stripping=losing bra,Ugh.  I'm not sure which is more embarrassing...the nudity or the losing.
3-stripping=losing bra,As you might imagine, sports bras are meant to stay <i>on</i>...
3-stripping=losing bra,This is a sports bra...so you've finally gotten me down to how I wouldn't dress in public.
3-stripping=losing bra,You must be proud of yourself, gettin me naked.  But there isn't much to see.
3-stripping=losing bra,Sorry, but my chest isn't exactly worth the effort.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing bra,Energy propulsion.  You'd have to ask Parfet for the details.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing bra,How do you sail around in the <i>sea</i>?  Wouldn't that ruin the electronics?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bra,I'm far more annoyed about losing this badly.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bra,Perhaps normally I'd be incensed about revealing my breasts...but really, it's the losing that's doing this to me.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bra,Can't take this off quite as smoothly as the suit...not that I want to.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing bra,Whatever insecurity I had about my breasts has switched to my poker skills.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing bra,AT Field?  I told you, I don't know what you're talking about.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing bra,An AT Field?  Sounds like the Paksis's energy--nebulous at best.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing bra,A field?  Why?  It's just my chest.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing bra,That's in your best interest, Pit.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing bra,Among Mejarians, at least, my chest leaves something to be desired...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing bra,You had <i>expectations</i>?  Where men stand on breasts is a mystery to me.
3-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing bra,This is doubly uncomfortable with a man around...
3-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing bra,I wonder how an Earth man will react to this...Tarakkians would just run away.
3-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing bra,Am I being distracted by the man here?
3-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing bra,Nothing weird about this to an Earth man...Tarakkians think our milk is corrosive.
3-stripping,totalExposed:0-0,totalNaked:0-0,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=losing bra,It's embarrassing enough to have to show my breasts, but to be the first to do so...
3-stripping,totalExposed:0-0,totalNaked:0-0,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=losing bra,Was this Jura's plan?  To knock me down a peg through public humiliation?
3-stripping,totalExposed:0-0,totalNaked:0-0,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=losing bra,I really have underestimated you...now I'm paying the price.
3-stripping,totalExposed:0-0,totalNaked:0-0,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=losing bra,No one else has even exposed themselves...this is pathetic.
3-stripping,totalExposed:0-0,totalNaked:0-0,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=losing bra,We're in a group, yet I feel more alone than ever.
3-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,I'm not the first, so I have no right to complain...
3-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Looks like I'll be joining you.
3-stripping,totalExposed:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Glad I'm not the first to show nudity.  I would have never forgiven myself...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bra,You make me uncomfortable for <i>other</i> reasons.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bra,I'm perfectly comfortable with nudity...but not with losing.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bra,You'd be comfortable nude in a Harvest mothership.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing bra,Well, Jura, some of us have a professional bone in our bodies.
3-stripping,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,You masturbating like that puts this into perspective.
3-stripping,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Could be worse...I could be masturbating.
3-stripping,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,One last line of defense...before I have to join you.
3-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Well, when others have sacrificed more...
3-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,Sometimes you just need to hold the line.
3-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing bra,At least my groin is still covered.  That's more than some of us can say...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bra,Well, if you're a hero, confidence would probably inspire the people you interact with.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bra,I try to maintain confidence.  If the leader loses faith, so will everyone else.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bra,It's just my breasts...if I didn't have the confidence for this, I'd have no place among the crew.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bra,Confidence is a good trait in a woman, no matter your station in life...so I'd agree.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=losing bra,Confidence in your breasts is one thing...but confidence in general is good, yes.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bra,You can tell?  Suppose I'm not as stoic as I'd like to be...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bra,You look even happier than usual, so I suppose we even out.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bra,Excuse me for not being thrilled about public nudity, especially when there isn't much for me to show.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing bra,Meanwhile, your only emotion is "pleased with yourself."
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=losing bra,The <i>Blue Hair Club</i>?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bra,I'll be sure to shower your breasts with praise when it's <i>your</i> turn.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bra,It's a shame you're immune to humiliation, or I'd try to pay you back for this.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bra,Hard to retort when you'd love nothing more than to get your breasts out...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bra,I'm not going to make a fuss about it...you're doing that for me.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing bra,I'm not complaining, am I?  Don't make me out to be some whining idiot.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bra,I don't wear a bra for the express purpose of taking it off in front of people.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bra,I'll leave the theatrics to you, Jura.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bra,You could <i>use</i> a bra's support, Jura.  They'll start to sag one day...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing bra,I figured <i>you</i> didn't wear a bra because it would clash with your dress...not that that dress doesn't have issues itself.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bra,Your lecherous commentary is more distracting than your body, Jura.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bra,Yes.  We're all very distracted.  Just like you wanted.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bra,Must be nice having no decency at all.  You certainly lead a carefree life...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bra,Well, you're cheerful, in a relationship, and still highly-ranked.  Maybe you've got the right attitude about your body...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=losing bra,A gorgeous body goes a long way.  It's good you have that to be proud of...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bra,Always good to hear your support, Jura.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bra,Cute has never been a word I wanted to describe me...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bra,Cute.  Right.  What I've always aimed for.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing bra,I'll just let you continue talking...maybe it'll distract everyone.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bra,Valore?  What's <i>she</i> got to with this?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bra,<i>Valore</i>?  ...Don't make any assumptions.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bra,Any relationship with another squadron leader...would just spell trouble.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bra,I can't be with Valore...it'd distract us both from work.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bra,<i>Valore</i>?  I'm not going to endanger our pilots due to...potential relationship issues.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing bra,<i>Valore</i>?  We--we can't do that...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing bra,Jura being here is easier.  At least I have some authority over her.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing bra,We shower together.  Undoing this bra is more awkward than Jura's presence.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing bra,If you're going to admire my resolve, I'd prefer it be from putting up with Jura's laziness for several years.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing bra,I couldn't care less about Jura's opinion on my breasts.  I'd prefer if she had criticisms of my leadership.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=losing bra,...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=losing bra,The Nirvana's artificial gravity is equal to Earth's, as is Mejare's.  You probably just exercise more.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=losing bra,Gravity has nothing to do with it.  I just need to work harder.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=losing bra,I'd have a more impressive chest if the gravity were actually lower...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-sei:1=losing bra,Public nudity isn't my idea of fun.  Drinking is even less so.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-sei:1=losing bra,I don't handle alcohol well...that's the farthest thing from fun I can imagine.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-sei:1=losing bra,There's other ways to have fun besides drinking and stripping.  That's just vulgar...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-sei:1=losing bra,Never did I think I'd be playing this game with two blue-haired drunken soldiers.  At least you two have a lot in common.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=losing bra,I'd also like to know what an AT Field <i>is</i>, for the record.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=losing bra,Whatever this "AT Field" is, it sounds more interesting than my breasts.  So does how you know about them...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=losing bra,You two <i>are</i> strangers, correct?  I'd like to know how she's heard of them, too...and what they <i>are</i>.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing bra,Photograph me if you want.  Nobody knows who I am.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing bra,Take pictures if you want.  I doubt they'll reach Mejare.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing bra,Are you taking photographs?  If this reaches the ship, Jura will never take me seriously again.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing bra,I have bad memories of my picture being taken...or good, in a way.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing bra,Are you taking photographs?  I'd like to see you try to blackmail a pirate.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing bra,Take pictures if you want.  My <i>Wanted</i> mugshot is outdated anyway.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bra,What exactly would buying time accomplish?  If I were a coward, I'd just leave.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bra,It's a sports bra...it's meant to stay in place.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bra,Figures a man wouldn't understand the necessity of a secure bra...it's not meant to come off easily.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bra,How's buying time supposed to help me?  There's no way out of this...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing bra,If I didn't have to fiddle with it, it'd be too loose to be useful.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bra,I hope you don't think I'm going to end up with one of these Earth women...or <i>men</i>, God forbid.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bra,I don't see the point in playing up my looks...especially with <i>you</i> around.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bra,No need to brag when you're willing to do it for me, disingenuous as it may be.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing bra,Why do you insist on acting like I'm some sort of model?  Just to hype yourself up later?


#lost all clothing
4-stripped=annoyed,No need for you to comment on size...
4-stripped=annoyed,I know, I know.  They're small.
4-stripped=annoyed,I know they're underwhelming, no need to tell me...
4-stripped=thinking,I guess I got the competition I wanted...
4-stripped=annoyed,Don't patronize me...
4-stripped=stretching,If you were hoping for bigger, get Jura to come here.  Or Barnette.  Or Dita.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,<i>Now</i> you're adopting my mindset.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,Better that than on my chest.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,...What breasts have you been looking at?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,This <i>2B</i> woman must have next to nothing if my breasts are impressive to you.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,To a man, I suppose <i>any</i> amount of breast tissue is a lot, isn't it?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=bored,I tend to compare myself to other women, so I'll have to disagree.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=pleased,I'm totally lost in this conversation...but the idea of a teenager spying on a clandestine government organization <i>is</i> pretty amusing.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=interested,I'll be honest...if she is, I side with the teenager over the state.  Good for you, Futaba.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=addressing,That's a funny thought.  Listen, Futaba, if you need protection from the law, the Nirvana has room for you.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=addressing,Rebelling against authority?  I like you, Futaba.  Keep up the good work.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,count-futaba:1=pleased,Guess Earthlings have more intellectual ways of rebelling against the state than shooting lasers...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=bored,Photograph me if you want.  Nobody knows who I am.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=disappointed,Take pictures if you want.  I doubt they'll reach Mejare.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=bored,Are you taking photographs?  If this reaches the ship, Jura will never take me seriously again.

4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,No frame of reference?  Aren't there women where you live?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=confused,No frame of reference?  I thought you worked for a woman.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,No frame of reference?  I thought Earth men and women couldn't get enough of each other.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,...Thank you.  But don't you know any women where you come from?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,Are they?  Maybe...yours are a little shapelier, I'd say.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=disappointed,Maybe you're right.  Yours <i>do</i> look nice...but I didn't really expect much from an Earth woman in the first place.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=thinking,I'm used to comparing myself to women from Mejare...and most of them are more impressively endowed than I am.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=bored,Mejarians have different standards for size than Earth women, I suppose...not that your breasts aren't nice.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=thinking,I know.  I'm sorry, Misato.  Just a little neurotic about it...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=addressing,Don't feel bad.  Dita tends to just yell things out when under pressure, too.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=addressing,...Do your teammates appreciate that?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=addressing,Phantom Thieves?  What separates a thief from a pirate, exactly?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=disappointed,...I have no clue what you're on about now.  Are you feeling alright?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=disappointed,...Already <i>what</i>?  You need to speak clearly when you address people.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=stretching,There's nothing wrong with nudity...women should work hard and be proud of their bodies.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=annoyed,You're looking a little queasy, Ochako.  Is there something wrong with my breasts?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,Staying fit is never irrelevant, Sei.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=addressing,You'd better ease up on the drinking, or you'll let yourself go.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,...Yes, Sei.  There are cuter chests.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Indeed you do.  Even anatomically speaking.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,...You can keep <i>Misty</i> out of this, too.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=stressed,Leave Misty out of this.  I'm not...<i>looking for a relationship</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Don't talk about Misty here.  She's too young for this...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,First Valore, and now Misty.  Can't believe I'm saying this, but focus on <i>yourself</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,Glad you're enjoying the game, even in defeat.  That makes one of us.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching,I'm feeling about the same as always, Jura. Just a little colder.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,I hope you didn't think I'd be all embarrassed.  Annoyed, yes, but I have nothing to be embarrassed about.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,I'm feeling fine.  That's it.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Am I feeling any better?  I'm feeling...<i>competitive</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,I'm feeling competitive, but unfortunately you can no longer help me with that.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pleased,I was just about to tell you to stop agitating it, actually.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=addressing,I don't know.  Shouldn't blue-haired women have the coldness to match?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=stretching,Somehow I think you're just using this as another excuse to brag.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=pleased,So, not content with bragging about yourself, you've moved on to your crewmates?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,I don't know, Jura, our breasts seem the same as any other woman's.  Sure this isn't more about <i>you</i>?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=thinking,We shouldn't be exoticizing ourselves.  That's probably how the Harvest got started.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,...Although I maintain there isn't much to them.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=bored,Next to you, anyway, I have little to brag about.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=thinking,My chest is mediocre...but that's all I'll say on the subject.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,Maybe a massage would help them grow.  No, not from <i>you</i>.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,Your time is coming.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,You know better than anyone that I'm not that easy to finish off.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=stretching,I'm sure you're annoyed yourself that I stole the breast reveal from you.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=pleased,I'm naked, and you're winning.  Neither of us is happy.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=thinking,They're nothing special for Mejare.  Earth I have no clue about...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=stretching,No use being a braggart when you're painfully average.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,I don't dwell on it, alright?  And if you're going to compliment me, make it something I <i>worked</i> for.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=disappointed,False confidence is a lot more damaging than false shame in the end...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,I <i>could</i> go the spa right about now.  I'll be sure to do that after I win.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,The spa might help steam some tension away...sounds like a good idea.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=pleased,Don't tell them we have a spa.  It'll just make them want to come back with us.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,You've said it yourself: too much time in the spa and I won't have any breasts left.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=thinking,Well...there isn't much to them.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,It's called modesty, Jura...and knowing your flaws.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=disappointed,It'd be healthy for you to admit your <i>own</i> flaws, even if they're not physical ones.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=bored,Hate how I had to fiddle with that so much for a lackluster reveal...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=thinking,...I understand your concern.  Making me strip in public isn't about to make me change my mind, though.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=disappointed,And was this game your idea of cheering me up about it?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=stretching,It's got nothing yo do with you, Jura...but I appreciate your concern.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,At least I've got crewmates who worry about me.
4-must_strip_winning=bored,You can't avoid these things forever...
4-must_strip_winning=thinking,Well, here we go.  Can't say I expected my shorts to carry a lead.
4-must_strip_winning=disappointed,You've forced me to match you...congrats.
4-must_strip_winning=bored,I always enjoy games more when I'm winning.
4-must_strip_winning=bored,Couldn't finish off my opponent...a classic mistake.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,You know, Jura, you don't <i>have</i> to flirt with me.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,I don't know why I expected you to be respectful at any point tonight.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,I know you're a fan of compliments, Jura...well, you're <i>impossible to ignore</i>.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Any secrets my outfit kept disappeared a long time ago.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,Held this off as long as I could...
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,You've finally pushed me to match you.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=interested,I really made you work for this...
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I had a streak there...now I'm just streaking.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,You thinking I enjoy any part of this is more insulting than dragging me here in the first place.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I certainly don't <i>want</i> to be naked, but I can with live it.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I didn't have much faith in these shorts...but with my breasts out, I suppose the worst is over already, anyway.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,I do <i>not</i> enjoy being naked.  Not everyone is <i>you</i>, Jura.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Like a woman, same as you.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Mejarians are every bit as human as Earth women, despite Earthlings' known xenophobia.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,Let's just say I don't plan on following your example, Jura.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Can't say you've made a <i>terrible</i> case for public masturbation...but I'd rather maintain a claim of decency over you.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,I'd really hate to have to masturbate at this point...that means I'd have lost.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,I don't feel the need to listen to a recently-disgraced subordinate.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=interested,It's true, Jura...you're playing far better than I expected of you.  I'm impressed.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,At least you've been proving that you actually listen to me from time to time.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,You're not doing half bad, Jura.  If you win this, consider me officially proud of you for once.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,Well, considering you were wearing more than me from the start, I'm a little less than impressed.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,I knew showing my breasts would shake me...
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,You're catching up quickly.  So am I, in a way.
4-must_strip_winning,timeInStage:0-0=addressing,You've evened the odds.  But I'll take it from here.
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I had <i>two pair</i>...you <i>really</i> want to see me naked.
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough?  You've <i>earned</i> this.
4-must_strip_winning,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I appreciate a challenge...and you're giving me one.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,<i>Designers</i>?  What are you on about?
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,I wasn't <i>designed</i>.  My Oma and Fama just made a few genetic tweaks...they had the money for it.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=annoyed,If by designers you mean my <i>parents</i>.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,I appreciate the compliments, but they're unnecessary.  And I didn't have <i>designers</i>.
4-must_strip_normal=bored,I can't believe it's come to this...
4-must_strip_normal=annoyed,I hope none of you is from the Harvest...
4-must_strip_normal=thinking,My mind is clouded...I can't focus.
4-must_strip_normal=addressing,Some of my crewmates would back out at this point...but not me.
4-must_strip_normal=annoyed,I'm getting soft...and for some of us, the opposite is happening.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I dress for function.  Do you know what <i>function</i> means, Jura?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,Best to have respect for older women, Jura.  You'll be old one day, and you'll need something respectable besides your looks.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4,marker:oma_and_fama=addressing,You shouldn't joke about looking old.  You want to be Barnette's Fama, right?  That'll age you quite a bit...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,If you've got any underwear on at all, I'm sure it's a few thin strings of fabric at best.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Looks like I just need to practice more.  Nothing else to it.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,I thought my poker face was up to snuff, but I suppose having my breasts out will put a crack in it.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,Clearly you're a better poker player, Jura.  I've taught you well.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=pleased,Seems the student's surpassed the...other student.  You must have been listening all those times I played cards with you.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=pleased,Good to see you have some faith in me, though it may be more than I have in myself.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Are those genuine words of encouragement?  I wasn't sure you were capable of that.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Don't sell yourself short.  You've pinned me down, so do the right thing and finish me off.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=pleased,This kind of self-doubt is why you're still ranked below me, Jura.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=unimpressed,It's a real shame, considering stripping is all you wanted to do anyway.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=disappointed,You've seen me nude in the showers, so I can only assume you brought me here to take me down a peg.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,A nude Mejarian is like a nude Earth woman, except for perhaps some unusual hair colors.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,It's not as if Mejarians dress to conceal.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,I haven't lost <i>yet</i>.  I wouldn't recommend getting cocky against me, Jura.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,Sometimes the best strategy is to feign defeat.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,Unless you're planning on being a cheat and taking that dress off in stages, I'd say you're not so far ahead of me.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,I'm just glad you're giving me a good challenge, Jura.  I didn't expect that from you.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,You thinking I enjoy any part of this is more insulting than dragging me here in the first place.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I certainly don't <i>want</i> to be naked, but I can with live it.

4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Completely naked...I did what I could to prevent this.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,Just when I need it most, my streak fails me.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Nearly slipped away...now I'm slipping them off.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,You know, Jura, you don't <i>have</i> to flirt with me.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,I don't know why I expected you to be respectful at any point tonight.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,I know you're a fan of compliments, Jura...well, you're <i>impossible to ignore</i>.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Any secrets my outfit kept disappeared a long time ago.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,Let's just say I don't plan on following your example, Jura.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Can't say you've made a <i>terrible</i> case for public masturbation...but I'd rather maintain a claim of decency over you.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,I'd really hate to have to masturbate at this point...that means I'd have lost.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,I don't feel the need to listen to a recently-disgraced subordinate.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,<i>Designers</i>?  What are you on about?
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,I wasn't <i>designed</i>.  My Oma and Fama just made a few genetic tweaks...they had the money for it.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=annoyed,If by designers you mean my <i>parents</i>.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,I appreciate the compliments, but they're unnecessary.  And I didn't have <i>designers</i>.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Like a woman, same as you.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Mejarians are every bit as human as Earth women, despite Earthlings' known xenophobia.
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I had <i>two pair</i>...you <i>really</i> want to see me naked.
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough?  You've <i>earned</i> this.
4-must_strip_normal,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I appreciate a challenge...and you're giving me one.
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Psyched out...
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,My cards must be written all over my face...
4-must_strip_normal,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Shot down in flames.
4-must_strip_losing=bored,I need to apologize to Gascogne after this game...
4-must_strip_losing=thinking,I can't afford these mistakes...not here, not ever.
4-must_strip_losing=bored,If you told the captain I played this badly, she wouldn't believe you...
4-must_strip_losing=annoyed,I'm still in this game, and don't you forget it.
4-must_strip_losing=bored,My last line of defense.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,<i>Designers</i>?  What are you on about?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,I wasn't <i>designed</i>.  My Oma and Fama just made a few genetic tweaks...they had the money for it.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=annoyed,If by designers you mean my <i>parents</i>.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:9s=disappointed,I appreciate the compliments, but they're unnecessary.  And I didn't have <i>designers</i>.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Looks like I just need to practice more.  Nothing else to it.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,I thought my poker face was up to snuff, but I suppose having my breasts out will put a crack in it.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,Clearly you're a better poker player, Jura.  I've taught you well.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=pleased,Seems the student's surpassed the...other student.  You must have been listening all those times I played cards with you.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=pleased,Good to see you have some faith in me, though it may be more than I have in myself.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Are those genuine words of encouragement?  I wasn't sure you were capable of that.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,Don't sell yourself short.  You've pinned me down, so do the right thing and finish me off.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=pleased,This kind of self-doubt is why you're still ranked below me, Jura.
4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I had <i>two pair</i>...you <i>really</i> want to see me naked.
4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,<i>Two pair</i> wasn't enough?  You've <i>earned</i> this.
4-must_strip_losing,hasHand:Two Pair=addressing,I appreciate a challenge...and you're giving me one.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=unimpressed,It's a real shame, considering stripping is all you wanted to do anyway.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=disappointed,You've seen me nude in the showers, so I can only assume you brought me here to take me down a peg.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=stretching,A nude Mejarian is like a nude Earth woman, except for perhaps some unusual hair colors.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=addressing,It's not as if Mejarians dress to conceal.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,I haven't lost <i>yet</i>.  I wouldn't recommend getting cocky against me, Jura.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,Sometimes the best strategy is to feign defeat.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,Unless you're planning on being a cheat and taking that dress off in stages, I'd say you're not so far ahead of me.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,I'm just glad you're giving me a good challenge, Jura.  I didn't expect that from you.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=addressing,I dress for function.  Do you know what <i>function</i> means, Jura?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,Best to have respect for older women, Jura.  You'll be old one day, and you'll need something respectable besides your looks.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4,marker:oma_and_fama=addressing,You shouldn't joke about looking old.  You want to be Barnette's Fama, right?  That'll age you quite a bit...
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,If you've got any underwear on at all, I'm sure it's a few thin strings of fabric at best.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=disappointed,You thinking I enjoy any part of this is more insulting than dragging me here in the first place.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I certainly don't <i>want</i> to be naked, but I can with live it.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=bored,I didn't have much faith in these shorts...but with my breasts out, I suppose the worst is over already, anyway.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=unimpressed,I do <i>not</i> enjoy being naked.  Not everyone is <i>you</i>, Jura.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,Let's just say I don't plan on following your example, Jura.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=bored,Can't say you've made a <i>terrible</i> case for public masturbation...but I'd rather maintain a claim of decency over you.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,I'd really hate to have to masturbate at this point...that means I'd have lost.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,I don't feel the need to listen to a recently-disgraced subordinate.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,It feels like I'm stuck with an idiot player who has too much time to mess with the offline version.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=disappointed,...Well, it's nice to be able to break character for once.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like ~player~ needs to learn that Shaggy Blanco stopped being funny in 2017.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...I'd rather have seen you in Dragon Ball Super than the actual ending, so there's that.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=bored,...Well, since we're all admitting we're fictional, it's sort of liberating, actually.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:el_shaggy_blanco=unimpressed,Like the fourth wall is collapsing on top of me.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Like a woman, same as you.
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:elaine=addressing,Mejarians are every bit as human as Earth women, despite Earthlings' known xenophobia.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,What a mess I'm being tonight.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,This hasn't been my A game...
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=annoyed,Even Hibiki would be outplaying me like this.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:0-0=bored,This is poker play worthy of Hibiki himself.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=bored,I really don't care about being naked...but I was having a good run there.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,The bra was a more painful loss anyway.
4-must_strip_losing,timeInStage:7-99=disappointed,Even after that run, I'm still losing.  But don't think I'm through just yet.
4-stripping=losing shorts,Are you ready?  This would make a whole crowd of Tarakkians flee in terror.
4-stripping=losing shorts,Prepare yourself for the rarest sight on all of Tarak...
4-stripping=losing shorts,I guess Earth men wouldn't find me particularly interesting...
4-stripping=losing shorts,And now for the body you could already make out from the beginning.
4-stripping=losing shorts,I never did leave much to the imagination in the first place...
4-stripping=losing shorts,I know a few Earthlings who'd <i>really</i> like to have my body...and all of yours, too.
4-stripping,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=losing shorts,Since we're all women, this isn't that awkward...
4-stripping,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=losing shorts,I wonder if I'd lose my nerve if any men were playing...
4-stripping,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=losing shorts,At least there's no men around...
4-stripping,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=losing shorts,No different than on Mejare, at least.
4-stripping,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=losing shorts,Would I be playing better if there were a man around to keep me on edge?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing shorts,No use complaining about the hand you're dealt...metaphorically speaking.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing shorts,Fate's just an excuse people make for their failures...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing shorts,If it's fate for me to be fully nude as you lord over me in your dress, then I want nothing to do with it.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=losing shorts,Why defer to destiny when you can take charge of your own life?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing shorts,Is pubic hair common on Earth?  Any we see here might just be coincidence...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing shorts,She's right, I shave...almost everyone does on Mejare.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing shorts,I expected you to tease them about that, not just spell it out.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=losing shorts,I mean, I don't consider shaving a badge of honor...just seems more sensible to me.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing shorts,Is that what Earth people call male and female parents?  I had parents...they were both women, that's all.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing shorts,I was <i>technically</i> made in a lab...but it was from my parents' eggs.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s,marker:oma_and_fama=losing shorts,I had parents, just not a male one...my Fama carried me like your Earth mothers.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=losing shorts,I had parents...I'm not a robot, despite what my crewmates might have to say on the matter.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing shorts,Why would I protest?  I lost fair and square.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elaine=losing shorts,<i>Protest</i>?  Mejarians are taught to be proud of their bodies.  Decent advice as far as Mejare goes.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing shorts,Frivolous <i>what</i>?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing shorts,Pirates aim for ruthless efficiency, actually.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=losing shorts,Pirates bother with whatever they have to.  And deep down, we're still women.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing shorts,Actually, Pit, I'm just getting started.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing shorts,If you think being naked is going to rattle me, Pit, I've been through much worse.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing shorts,Almost over?  I'm finishing this game on <i>my</i> terms.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=losing shorts,I wouldn't underestimate a cornered woman, Pit.  Neither should you.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing shorts,If <i>this</i> rattled me, I would've been shot down and killed a long time ago.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing shorts,I should hope I'd be able to handle this.  I don't expect <i>these</i> Earthlings to bear down and harvest my organs.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing shorts,You know good and well dealing with the Harvest is much worse.  Considering these are Earth people, maybe it's good you still have your sword.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=losing shorts,Would you be equally as calm?  It's a good trait for a squadron leader to have, if you're looking to be promoted.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing shorts,I'm not embarrassed.  It's called <i>decency</i>.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing shorts,I wouldn't expect you to understand why someone might not enjoy showing off their body.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing shorts,I have to wonder if you'll lose your nerve when it's <i>your</i> turn...probably not.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=losing shorts,You're half-naked all the time regardless...but then, that suit always shows my figure.  Keeps me humble, I suppose...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing shorts,<i>Vaginas</i>, yes.  I don't know why Earth culture seems to skirt around the issue.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing shorts,Even if we hadn't, it's not as if genitals differ from person to person on Mejare.  We could wager a guess.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing shorts,Yes, we've seen each others' vaginas.  I don't know why you consider that a watershed moment.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=losing shorts,...Yes.  Would you say most Earth women are like you, Elizabeth?  Few Mejarians would shudder at the word <i>vagina</i>.
4-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing shorts,And with a man around...how embarrassing.
4-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing shorts,Can't believe I'm stripping down with a man nearby...
4-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing shorts,And with a man around...I hardly want to do it around other women.
4-stripping,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=losing shorts,I'm not ashamed of my body...but I <i>am</i> worried about it.
4-stripping,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=losing shorts,Next to a masturbator, being naked is nothing.
4-stripping,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=losing shorts,Nothing between me and masturbating now...nothing but my own skill.
4-stripping,totalMasturbating:1-4,priority:0=losing shorts,At least you've proven public masturbation isn't all that bad.
4-stripping,totalNaked:0-0,priority:0=losing shorts,Didn't think I'd be the first naked...or that I'd <i>ever</i> be naked.
4-stripping,totalNaked:0-0,priority:0=losing shorts,The first to be pushed this far...well done.
4-stripping,totalNaked:0-0,priority:0=losing shorts,I can handle nudity.  Can you handle me at my best?
4-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing shorts,At least I'm not the first.  That would have been pathetic.
4-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing shorts,Totally naked...it's quickly becoming fashionable.
4-stripping,totalNaked:1-4,priority:0=losing shorts,I'll live.  Wasn't even the first to be pushed this far.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=losing shorts,<i>Hair</i>?  Hate to break it to you...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=losing shorts,I'm afraid they're going to have to keep waiting, Sei.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,Hair?  Hair belongs on the head...nowhere else.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,Hair belongs on the head alone...though men don't seem to believe in that.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing shorts,Projecting your indecency onto me only shows your own insecurity about it.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing shorts,If I liked being stared at, why would I keep that a secret from you?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing shorts,It's nice to be appreciated, but I'd like women to respect me for my leadership...something I've <i>earned</i>.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing shorts,You're right, I'm really a lecherous, exhibitionist nymph.  You've got me all figured out, Jura.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=losing shorts,Even if that were true, I wouldn't give you the satisfaction of admitting it.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing shorts,Don't worry.  Soon you'll have to join me, from the looks of it.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing shorts,You're talking like you had respect for me before.  I never got that impression.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing shorts,You can't let shame stop you from finishing a mission...or keeping your word.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=losing shorts,It'd be far more embarrassing to back out like a coward.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,Never thought <i>you</i> would be one to spoil a surprise.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,Is there <i>anyone</i> on our crew with pubic hair?  Barnette doesn't...Dita, maybe?  She's absentminded enough to forget...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,Shaving is one of the few cultural quirks of Mejare I subscribe to.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,It's aerodynamic and clean.  Why wouldn't I shave?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:pubic_hair_comments=losing shorts,I suppose Earth people would find blue pubic hair fascinating.  Sorry to disappoint...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing shorts,I think the Harvest would agree we're quite the team, as would the Mejarian military.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing shorts,Well, I've defied death more than a few times with your help.  So we're certainly a team.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing shorts,I'll be honest.  I'm not feeling much solidarity with you at the moment.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing shorts,I think I may have had a stronger bond with you <i>before</i> playing this game, actually.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing shorts,My idea of helping you is shooting a soldier that's got you pinned down...not giving you a body to ogle.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=losing shorts,Shouldn't you be thinking about your <i>girlfriend</i>, Jura?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing shorts,Photograph me if you want.  Nobody knows who I am.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing shorts,Take pictures if you want.  I doubt they'll reach Mejare.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing shorts,Are you taking photographs?  If this reaches the ship, Jura will never take me seriously again.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing shorts,I have bad memories of my picture being taken...or good, in a way.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing shorts,Are you taking photographs?  I'd like to see you try to blackmail a pirate.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=losing shorts,Take pictures if you want.  My <i>Wanted</i> mugshot is outdated anyway.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing shorts,You're the one who dragged me here, Jura.  And I couldn't care less if the state doesn't want me nude in public.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing shorts,I don't care what the state thinks of me.  My body is my own...though you've basically appropriated it tonight.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing shorts,Forget the state...<i>I</i> don't want to be publicly nude.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=losing shorts,Somehow I doubt stripping in public is Mejare's biggest issue with our lifestyles.

-3-stripped=butt,Well, here I am.  Satisfied?
-3-stripped=butt,Always expect the worst in your battle plan...
-3-stripped=butt,Yes, the carpet matches the drapes...or it would, if I had one.
-3-stripped=butt,I was cocky coming into this game...not anymore.
-3-stripped=butt,Seeing me like <i>this</i> would get you forty lashes on Tarak.
-3-stripped,marker:pubic_hair_comments=butt,Shaved is the way to be.  One less thing to worry about.
-3-stripped=butt,Knowing Jura, she's planned this and has Paiway on the scene...
-3-stripped=butt,I hope Paiway isn't lurking around here with her camera...
-3-stripped=butt,This'd be one hell of a <i>Pai-check</i>...
-3-stripped=butt,Now to get rid of these things.  I'm sure you'll appreciate the view...
-3-stripped=butt,Enjoy the rear view while you can.  I need to find a place to put these...
-3-stripped=butt,As you can now clearly see, these shorts were all I had left.
-3-stripped=butt,And now my clothes pile is complete...as is your view.
-3-stripped=butt,Don't think you've embarrassed me.  That suit leaves nothing to the imagination...here, look.
-3-stripped=butt,My backside is nothing stimulating, right?  Not after you saw it in the suit already.
-3-stripped=butt,Well...here I am.  All of me.
-3-stripped=butt,Best to sate your curiosity now than let it simmer.  Here I am from the back...
-3-stripped=butt,Considering my wardrobe, being naked is nothing but a color change for me.
-3-stripped=butt,If you think I'm ashamed of my body, you're mistaken...but I <i>am</i> ashamed of losing.
-3-stripped=butt,Seems my bare breasts weren't enough to satisfy you.  Perhaps my backside is.
-3-stripped=butt,Breasts are fetishized on Mejare...butts are usually an afterthought.  What about Earth?
-3-stripped=butt,I'm fond of the butt...exercise can improve it, unlike breasts.
-3-stripped=butt,I'm told the exercising I do has improved my backside.  You be the judge...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,Photograph me if you want.  Nobody knows who I am...especially not by my butt.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,Take pictures if you want.  I doubt they'll reach Mejare...or that anyone will recognize my butt.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,Are you taking photographs?  If this reaches the ship...well, they know what I look like naked.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,I have bad memories of my picture being taken...a photograph of my backside isn't nearly as bad.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,Are you taking photographs?  I'd like to see you try to blackmail a pirate...and one who's not afraid to show her backside in public.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,Take pictures if you want.  My <i>Wanted</i> mugshot is usually from the front.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=butt,Take pictures if you want, Shego.  I'd be impressed if Mejarian imperials could identify me by my rear.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=butt,I'm sure you're itching to join me.  Though with that thong, you essentially already have.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=butt,Oh, be quiet, Jura.  You've done nothing but tease and make fun all night.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=butt,Not a sincere bone in your body, is there?  I don't know what Barnette sees in you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=butt,Don't try to suck up to me later.  I'm remembering this for a long time.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=butt,Whatever's available.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:challenging_sei=butt,Finish me off and I'll tell you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=butt,The spa attendants offer to do it for me, but that's a little intimate for my tastes.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=butt,Mejarians have made a culture out of shaving...we've got more than a few methods.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=butt,Right.  That's why you're curled up on the floor and I'm still standing.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=butt,Remember who's still in the game and then go through that logic again, Jura.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=butt,That kind of attitude is exactly why you've lost, Jura...and are still ranked below me.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=butt,Every game has luck, Jura...but every game <i>also</i> boils down to skill.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=butt,Feel free to ask Jura more questions about Mejare when she's done ogling you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=butt,How'd you even <i>join</i> our crew, anyway?  You don't seem to hate Mejare all that much in the first place.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=butt,Half the time you talk like we're ambassadors from Mejare.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=butt,You're a better example of Mejarian bodies, if not poker skills.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=butt,Please.  I'll get that dress off of you myself...just to beat you, not to look.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=butt,You'll be in my position soon, Jura, regardless of whether you want to be.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=butt,There's no need, Jura.  You'll be losing in a moment, and then you can be as indecent as you please.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=butt,I've always told you to have a killer instinct.  Don't take pity on me...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=butt,Right now, I'm the enemy, Jura.  Don't do me any favors.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=butt,I'm the <i>worst</i>?  What, for shaving?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=butt,For shaving?  Quite common on Mejare, actually.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,marker:pubic_hair_comments=butt,For shaving?  Mejarians are obsessed with cleanliness, and I like to reduce friction.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=butt,For shaving, or for displaying my backside?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=butt,I'm the <i>worst</i>?  What for, shaving?  You can groom how you please.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:pubic_hair_comments=butt,For shaving?  Must not be common on Earth, judging by your own groin.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:pubic_hair_comments=butt,For shaving?  I like to reduce friction, given my profession.  I thought you said you worked with computers.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=butt,For shaving, or for displaying my backside?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=stressed,Valo--<i>there's nothing between me and Valore</i>.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=butt,Keep your ridiculous matchmaking to yourself.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=butt,Well, it'd be nice for my body to be appreciated, though I don't think I particularly deserve it.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=butt,...Valore's got nothing to do with me, besides being a colleague.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=unimpressed,<i>Valore</i>?  Just because you <i>want</i> to pair us all off doesn't mean it's going to happen.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=butt,Perhaps I'd get more attention if I were cheerful.  That'd be <i>your</i> advice, right?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=butt,I love competition, but competing to be the most beautiful seems a little shallow anyway.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=butt,Well, at least I could probably beat any of you in an <i>athletic</i> competition.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=butt,If you put more effort into piloting and went to the gym, I'd have no claim of superiority over you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=butt,You're better-looking than me, I agree...a better poker player, it would seem, too.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=butt,When the gym gets tanning lights, maybe you'll see some pigment.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=butt,I hear Earth has a bigger sun than we do...or at least doesn't have Tarak blocking it out.  So maybe my skin tone is strange...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=butt,I spend my time indoors.  So do you and Barnette...so it must just be genetics.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:riches_to_rags=butt,I was born pale...I'd rather that than the tan I got living on the streets.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,It's better I don't get a big head.  You can see what that does to a woman.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,I'm a leader.  I can't get arrogant...it'll endanger myself and others.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,An inflated ego can only be a detriment.  Best to stay humble, no matter how hard you work.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,I don't need an ego boost.  I've already made too many mistakes to be in this situation in the first place.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,You haven't been to Mejare.  I'm average-looking...try getting <i>Jura</i> to downplay her appearance.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,Why would I have a problem with it?  I'm prepared to show everything else, it would seem.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,Well, with a crewmate around, turning my back on the table is a bit easier...besides, you've earned this.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,The goal was to get me naked, wasn't it?  If I couldn't stop you, it seems fair you should see everything.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,It's the least I could do, since you've pushed me this far.  Perhaps the embarrassment will motivate me to play better.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,priority:150,count-jura:1=butt,Mejare has little interest in the butt...so I have little shame.  Breasts are the focus of our culture.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=butt,I've never cared much if it did.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=butt,My secrets are in my head, not on my body.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=butt,But apparently my poker skills leave something to be desired.  Does my backside?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=butt,Mejarians tend not to do so, as you can see.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=butt,If you think <i>my</i> outfit was revealing, take a look at Jura sometime.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:blue_hair=butt,Actually, blue hair <i>and</i> shaving are both common on Mejare.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:pubic_hair_comments=butt,Mejarians are obsessed with excess...but not when it comes to pubic hair.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:pubic_hair_comments=butt,If you have a taste for pubic hair, Marinette, don't come to Mejare.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:blue_hair=butt,Mejarians love vibrant hair colors.  I think Ezra's <i>brown</i> is honestly a bit exotic there.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=butt,The last thing I want to be is a representative of Mejare.  My only allegiance is to Magno Vivan's pirates.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=butt,Considering how flawed Mejare is, I suppose I <i>do</i> represent it well.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=butt,I think you, with your many frivolous accessories, capture the essence of Mejarian women much better.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=butt,Your jewelry and lecherous comments tells them everything they need to know about Mejarians.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=butt,<i>Derrière</i>?  That's an interesting name for it...probably fancier than it deserves.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=butt,I'm not ashamed of who I am, Elizabeth.  I'm not proud, either...but I lost fair and square.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=butt,...I'm glad you appreciate my backside.  I at least have tried to improve it, since you actually <i>can</i>...unlike breasts.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=butt,Do I, Elizabeth?  It's strange to get compliments for it...Mejare has an obsession with breasts.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=butt,That's flattering...or it <i>would</i> be, if you didn't seem so thrilled about piracy.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=butt,If you knew the first thing about space travel, I might say the same thing about you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine=butt,Flattering, but I think my poker skills leave too much to be desired, unfortunately.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=butt,It's better I don't get a big head.  Get Jura over here if you want to see what that does to you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=butt,I'm a leader.  I can't get arrogant...it'll endanger myself and others.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=butt,An inflated ego can only be a detriment.  Best to stay humble, no matter how hard you work.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=butt,I don't need an ego boost.  I've already made too many mistakes to be in this situation in the first place.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=butt,You haven't been to Mejare.  I'm average-looking.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=butt,Oh, shut up.  I know good and well you're just teasing.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=butt,You've got your pick of better-looking women if you wanted to cheat on Barnette.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=butt,Better you ogle <i>me</i> than some man, I suppose.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=butt,You'd better not start any relationship issues with Barnette.  The two of you arguing would do nothing but tank missions.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

0-male_human_must_strip=calm,Come on, ~player~.  Part of the game...
0-male_human_must_strip=calm,Looks like you lost, ~player~...
0-male_human_must_strip=disappointed,You must have expected this would happen.
0-male_human_must_strip=calm,Your turn, ~player~...
0-male_human_must_strip=thinking,A man...
0-male_human_must_strip=thinking,So, a man has to strip...
0-male_human_must_strip=calm,...
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=thinking,No need to antagonize him...it's hard being alone.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,I can respect having the courage to come alone.  Jura's the only reason I came here at all...
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,Can't say I'm thrilled about a man playing at all, but at least he didn't bring friends.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=bored,Jura dragging me here at all isn't what I'd call supportive, Rinkah.
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You're not very good at this, are you?
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,I suppose this game takes brainpower a man wouldn't have...
0-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Too much of a thinking woman's game?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=disappointed,About time...
0-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Quite a run you had there...
0-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Nice streak.  You have yet to beat me, though...
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  This is going to be a bore...
0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...you're no challenge at all.
0-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would eviscerate you.
0-male_must_strip=thinking,A man.
0-male_must_strip=thinking,So, a man has to strip.
0-male_must_strip=calm,Looks like you lost, ~name~.
0-male_must_strip=calm,Your turn, ~name~.
0-male_must_strip=disappointed,You must have expected this would happen.
0-male_must_strip=calm,Come on, ~name~.  Part of the game.
0-male_must_strip=calm,...
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,What is this "Pod" you keep referring to?  What does it do?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Are you going to explain what your "Pod" is, or are we all supposed to ignore it?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll bite.  What's this "Pod" you keep mentioning?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm curious about this "Pod" of yours.  I suppose you wanted me to ask about that, since you said it out loud.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why are you blindfolded?  Don't you want to see the cards?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you wearing a blindfold?  Are you really that confident?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you on a bet or something?  Take your blindfold off and play seriously.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Your outfit is one thing, but to be wearing a blindfold?  What's wrong with you?
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=impressed,Wait, you two work together?  That's...very awkward.  Jura and I split up when we came here...
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,I see even on Earth, the superiority of women is clearly entrenched.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  The captain is quite a bit older than I am...
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  I sure wouldn't want <i>Hibiki</i> playing this with me.
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Maybe I just lack the experience, but...are you a man or a woman?
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Men and women have always looked pretty distinct to me...and then there's you.
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you live underground?  Sounds claustrophobic...
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...That's a man, Jura.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I'm no expert, but I think Corrin is a <i>man</i>, actually.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I think Corrin's a man, Jura.  Though he <i>does</i> look feminine.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,The same person, both male and female...guess that cements it.  Men and women <i>are</i> the same species.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,I wonder what <i>I'd</i> look like as a man...horrifying.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Mejarian scientists.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=pleased,The same person, one born on Tarak and the other on Mejare.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Judging by his attitude, men are a lot more shy about nudity...which only makes this more curious.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=awkward,You two must be close, then.  Good to know men and women can be this comfortable around each other...I suppose.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,It's definitely a unique coincidence.  But being nude together is no issue for us...I wonder if that's true for these two.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Jura and I shower together, since the ship only has the communal bathroom...is that true for you two, as well?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Now</i> are you taking off that ridiculous blindfold?  Or...<i>tactical visor</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,So are you forfeiting, or are you finally deciding to let yourself see?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Attached to that blindfold?  Either give up the game or take off that thing...your move.
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Jura, do you think you could learn from this man?  Perhaps nonverbally?
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't seem too talkative, but I'm told you can handle a sword.  You could stand to learn something from this man, Jura.
0-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Barely talks, skilled with a sword?  Look at that, Jura.  He's everything you're not.
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=impressed,You're...a <i>man</i>?  Not like one I've ever seen.
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you speaking through a translator?  Is that some archaic Earth language?
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Earth languages besides the common tongue are a mystery to me.  Even Tarakkian code is not something I've ever concerned myself with.
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Facial markings?  Like Rabat's people.  I'll keep that in mind, Earth-man.
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,...I've seen enough men to know you're not human.
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly...<i>are</i> you?
0-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=disappointed,So <i>gay</i> is the term Earthlings use?  Sounds sort of derisive.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,Never thought I'd meet a <i>man</i> with my fashion sense.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you were frozen for decades.  Hibiki was that way, too...
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Hibiki could certainly benefit from that...not that he'd ever accept.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Seems unbecoming of a man to take the easy way out.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,If everyone on this <i>America</i> planet is built like you, I'd hate to see the women.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you really a captain?  You seem built more to <i>take</i> orders than give them.
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't need to strip for me to tell you're fit.  They'd worship you on Tarak.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll be honest.  You don't look like much of a man.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought men were supposed to be tall and strong.  Of course, Hibiki proves <i>that</i> wrong...
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why do you have wings?  I <i>thought</i> men were human, but maybe not.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Children aren't allowed in here, even male ones.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really, ~player~?  You picked <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really?  Over 100 characters and you pick <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've <i>seen</i> men.  You're Kool-Aid <i>monster</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...Have some respect for yourself, ~player~.  <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Unless it's April Fool's Day, you shouldn't be picking this character.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,If this is what Earthlings find attractive, I'm glad the colonists left.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,I'm not sure how to feel about being picked by the same player who'd choose <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>.
0-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,You must really hate me to stick me on a table with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,A "Street Fighter"...I've been in street fights.  Nothing to brag about.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Eternal Fighting Champion"?  You shouldn't rest on your laurels.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=impressed,I came to see a man here...you're certainly a lot of man.
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  You look like you can barely get yourself out of bed.
0-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Man or woman, unkempt appearances don't impress me.
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,So, you help that girl fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
0-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,You seem immature...but then, Hibiki makes that work for himself.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You're not very good at this, are you?
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,I suppose this game takes brainpower a man wouldn't have.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Too much of a thinking woman's game?
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=pleased,I never thought I'd meet a man shorter than Hibiki...but you might be the one.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who let this...<i>child</i> in here?
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Men really do come in all shapes and sizes.  You might as well be a woman.
0-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you?  You look like a child.  Get out.

0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.

0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.

0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you alright?  Your skin...it's pink, and it looks unhealthy.  I wouldn't put it past Earth to do this to undesirables...

0-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
0-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.

0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So...does "princess" mean "light dresser"?  That would make more than a few of my crewmates princesses.
0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,...Could you explain what a "princess" is?  I'm...not from Earth, so I don't know its titles.
0-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is a "princess" a position of power on Earth?  You'd think an authority figure would wear more clothing...

0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type...though a rather unintimidating one.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  You <i>claim</i> to protect, but only when it suits you.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=bored,Oh, perfect.  A soldier.  Try not to kill anyone for fun before the game is over.
0-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The ones I know enjoy indoctrinating children and shutting down housing districts.

0-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.

0-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.

0-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...

0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=annoyed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=addressing,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,<i>Now</i> are you done?  Or are you going to summon vines and perpetuate this?
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.

0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is it true you're a "princess"?  I'm told you hold some authority...which makes me question why you're here.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,I'm told you're a ruler of some sort...shouldn't you be <i>ruling</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,I hear you're an authority figure where you're from.  I'm sure your subjects appreciate you spending your time like this.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,My experience with authority has always been that they don't deserve their power...you being here reinforces that.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=impressed,You go to school for "magic"?  That...sounds rather fascinating, actually.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun...but I suppose magic would have made it easier.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't have good memories of school...maybe you could talk about your magic instead?
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm told you can use magic.  Sometimes the Paksis feels that way...we certainly never had any schooling on the subject.

0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,What do you think, Jura?  Should we have our arms replaced with robotics?

0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...what's a father?
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Interesting skin color.  Are you even human?  Or an Earthling?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare has strange hair colors...apparently Earth has strange <i>skin</i> colors.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confused,I'm not sure what's more distracting: the skin color, or the wings.  Are you from Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really thought this was Planet Earth.  I wasn't aware people here could be so...colorful.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What are those sounds you keep making?  Is that the language of...whatever planet you come from?
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,I can barely understand you...verbally <i>and</i> physically.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's with your speech?  You keep making these odd sounds in places...
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Let me guess.  You're going to take off your underwear.
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,I'm expecting a mundane display.

0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford that, if you wanted.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,Haven't you played cards before?  Aren't you wealthy enough to own a <i>casino</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though you've probably got more money than my whole crew.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  Even if it's only on finances.

0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.

0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  This is your chance, Jura.  Make connections.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  What do you think, Jura?  Was it for owning an anatomy book?
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...like us.
0-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,The same person, both male and female...that shreds any doubts I had about men and women being the same species.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,I wonder what Hibiki would look like as a woman...probably taller, honestly.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Tarakkian scientists.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,The same person, one born on Mejare and the other on Tarak.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women, and I'm not sure which one is prettier.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Good to see another woman who shares my fashion sense.  Even the color scheme is close...
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,My bodysuit is pretty standard among Mejarian styles...but looking at you, maybe it was inspired by Earth.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Bodysuits are comfortable, aren't they?  And efficient, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,That bodysuit of yours looks awfully similar to my own.  I don't think I could pull off that helmet, though.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...look, Jura, another one.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You're a fiery one...she's how I picture your and Barnette's daughters, Jura.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of Jura here.

0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I can see two reasons why you and Jura are going to get along this evening.  And your martial arts skills aren't one of them.
0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
0-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
0-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=thinking,Time travel...if it's true, I'm curious what you've actually used it for.  Unless you'd rather hide that...
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,That's quite the outfit.  You may have competition, Jura...but then, you like that.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm not sure I'd want to date someone who'd agree to it in a seedy place like this.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Unless she's heading to Mejare soon, I can't see that relationship working out.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You seem far more interested, Jura.  She <i>is</i> blonde, after all.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe <i>you</i> could flirt with her and bring her back.  Barnette could use some target practice.
0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe if she agreed to join the crew...but what from I hear, she <i>hunts</i> pirates.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> chilly, Jura.  At least I show my face.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Clearly I need to show less emotion, then.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You're right.  I could really improve my stoicism by watching her.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A <i>concession</i>?  I thought you were going to tease me all night.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I'm sure she has her reasons.  Stoicism is important for a leader...

0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,"Pearl"?  Jura's already a big fan of yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I feel your pain.  I command a short, overconfident man myself.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,Well, this is <i>one</i> way to grow closer to your colleagues.  I sure wouldn't want any crewmates here.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Surely a <i>goddess</i> wouldn't need a man to help her.
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
0-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's this about wrestling?  ...Sounds like a male pursuit.  Physical posturing...
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off.  What <i>planet</i> are you from?
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,That's an...interesting skin color.  And speech pattern.  Who <i>are</i> you, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Wha--<i>don't bring up Misty</i>!  It's not like she'll understand.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,You--I--Misty and I are not an <i>item</i>.  I just give her advice.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You know perfectly well Misty's into <i>men</i>, Jura...and also that she's too young.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Why do you try to twist my relationship with Misty into love?  She just...needs guidance.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Oh, good, another Meia.  Now I can take a day off of bossing Jura around.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Look at that, Jura.  The worst day of your life.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Playing with more than one of me is sweet.  Have you extended the same love to Jura here?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,I'm glad you like me enough to play with more than one of me, ~player~.  Do you like Jura, too?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I don't think people will be confused.  This woman seems a lot more well-known on this planet.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,One letter can make all the difference...just like one mistake.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,If you actually got us confused, I'd have Duero check your eyes before you posed a danger to the team.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I trust my second-in-command to track the subtle differences between Mei and I.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Assuming that style exists anywhere, it's too conspicuous.  This coloration blends into machinery.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,She can be as bubbly as she wants.  I doubt she has the responsibilities you or I carry.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,She looks young, Jura...and in a better position.  She can afford to be happy, so let her.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wherever she comes from, I'm sure that pattern is optimal.  She must wear it for a reason.
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too?  Until recently we never got far past the Mejarian system.
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,It took an accidental wormhole to actually fling us out of the Mejarian system.  <i>Your</i> Earth is a lot more adventurous.
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Everyone on Earth, exploring space in peace and harmony?  This Star Fleet sounds nice.  Tarak and Mejare can't even unite the sexes.
0-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll agree that traveling through space teaches you a lot about other civilizations.  The colonies we've run into have all been different.
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, take instructions from this woman so you can actually put that rapier to use.
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's, and your sword like Jura's here.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.  But the sword is distinctly Jura.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, learn from this woman and actually use your sword properly.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,As long as you've got that sword, could you teach Jura how to use it?  That rapier of hers is just for show.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't antagonize her, Jura.  I can respect a woman who understands the value of silence.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You could do to learn from me or her when it comes to occasionally being quiet.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You can't learn anything from talking, Jura.  Kyoko's being smart, listening in on us...
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,She <i>does</i> have my temperament.  Don't take that as an insult, Kyoko...more women should listen to others.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Do I have to be involved in this?  I didn't even lose...and I don't want the ship seeing this.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,The focus is on Jura.  Don't rope me into this...I don't want my pilots seeing me here.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,It's <i>Jura's</i> turn.  Just take two pictures of her and be done with it...she won't care if the ship sees her here.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Can't you just photograph Jura?  This could reach the ship...
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,See what too much makeup leads to, Jura?  You shouldn't concern yourself with it.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,A "goddess"?  I'm sorry if I ever called you vain, Jura.  This is a new one.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You have some competition for extravagant dress, Jura.  And vanity, apparently.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little on edge.  It's just a card game.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's an interesting streak in your hair.  Mejarians have unusual hair colors, but not on specific parts...the red matches your attitude.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm told you spend a lot of time fighting woman authority figures.  Guess we're not so different...even if your demeanor is a bit acerbic.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That red streak seems to betray your attitude.  Just try to relax...
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
0-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.  Although it would seem your outfit is branching out.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=calm,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...say, you look a little different than before.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And is it just me, or did you dress up for this?
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides the outfits.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about your outfit seems unusual for you...strange, since I've never met you before.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we won't be here long.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=confused,Are you counting each bandage as one layer?  If not, this'll be over soon.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really wasn't counting on seeing nudity this quickly.  At least it's a woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Did I just walk in on a game that's nearly over?
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
0-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Congratulations, ~player~.  You've found what are probably my rarest lines.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  You must really like me, ~player~.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  Honestly, ~player~, that's a little flattering.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=pleased,I see Earth has also perfected cloning technology.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Glad you appreciate me enough to play with more than one of me.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  That's...a little cute, ~player~.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,More than one of me?  Considering my responsibilities, that would really help.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,Would you look at that, ~player~'s figured out the offline version.  And apparently is very fond of me.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,More than one Meia?  How flattering.  Be sure to try out Jura, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Never thought I'd say <i>these</i> lines.  I'm glad you like me so much, ~player~.  That's sweet.
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,Someone said you gave up on school.  So did I...
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like you get a lot of exercise.  Always good to see in a woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=disappointed,You said something about a <i>killer</i>?  Earth's no stranger to killing, as far as I'm concerned.
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
0-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,You...what <i>are</i> you?  Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.  What <i>are</i> you, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...I hope you don't think the floating and lack of eyes is normal to us.  Or maybe it <i>is</i> on Earth...
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
0-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that a camera?  Paiway, our child nurse, is always skulking around with hers...so this is nothing new.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=bored,A camera?  Are you really going to photograph us all?  ...Whatever.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you trying to blackmail us with that camera?  I've been in the media for far worse than this.
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hope you don't think you're going to embarrass me with that camera.  I'm not exactly from here, anyway.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You said you come from the plains?  Sounds nice...Mejare's not very verdant, and Tarak's even worse.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You come from the plains, you said?  My parents took me to the plains when I was a little girl...it was fun to run around.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,The plains, you said you lived in?  Somehow I doubt the Earth I know has any green left...
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=pleased,Barnette's got green hair, too...but that's with the help of Mejarian genetic engineering.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=calm,Green hair isn't that strange on Mejare.  One of my pilots has it.  What about Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=impressed,Is your hair naturally green?  That'd be impressive for an Earth woman...
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons...or another dress, at least.
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're some kind of covert agent?  I'd be lying if I said I was good at sniffing those out.
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,Speaking of covert agents...I think we gave B.C. a newfound respect for women.
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,The Nirvana's had its share of covert agents.  They tend to warm up to our cause.
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=impressed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  I suppose the Paksis isn't all that different...
0-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  We've had our issues with hostile red light in the past.
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're some kind of hunter, correct?  I suppose a pirate isn't far off from that.
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's this planet <i>Pandora</i> like?  More verdant than Mejare, I hope.
0-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  I think I knew a woman named Pandora once...
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
0-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Bless you--oh, <i>no</i>.  Don't tell me...
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Not <i>this</i> again.  The blonde version?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,God bless you--oh, damn it.  She's changed back...
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Bless--damn it, that was Launch.  Here we go again...
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,Do you have someone to support you?  This switching can't be good for your mental health...or physical.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=calm,Your blonde version seems liable to get you killed.  Do you have friends?  Colleagues?  Are you alright?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,I'd hate to see you wander around with your...condition.  Are you sure you're safe, always switching as you do?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=thinking,Earth women are full of surprises...do you want to live on the Nirvana, just to have some support?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=calm,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,What are you waving that thing around for?  Guns aren't children's playthings!
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,Put the gun down, would you?  What are you so afraid of?
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...An acerbic, bestial woman waving a racketous mechanical gun around.  Just how I pictured Earth women.
0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,I can understand wanting to be armed in a seedy place like this, but you're taking this too far.  And don't wave it around!
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,You raid tombs?  All of Earth is ancient history is Mejare, not just dead queens.
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you certainly look fit, which is good to see in a woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,<i>Tombs</i>, you said?  Not for me...too cramped.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like Paiway dressed up as a fairy.  Are you old enough to be here?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I read about fairies as a girl.  They protected Mejarian children from marauding packs of men.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,A <i>fairy</i>?  Earth never fails to surprise me with its species variety.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a fairy?  I'd need to see something spectacular for you to match the stories I've heard.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'm told you hold some authority in a military organization.  I hope you're using that responsibly.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,A military woman?  Excuse me for not being impressed.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You don't seem quite as fiercely repulsive as the woman soldiers I've come to know.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,Military...nothing worse than having a soldier around.  Try not to kill anyone.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Mejare has detectives...but they mostly investigate enemies of the state.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Anyone who focuses on discovering secrets is probably hiding a few themselves.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  Are men any good in school?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  More nuanced than Mejare's, I hope.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem about as expressive as <i>I</i> ever get.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=impressed,These "Evas" I've heard of actually seem like impressive technology.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You said something about "Evas" before?  My Dread sounds a lot more reliable...but still, they sound fearsome.
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Evas" sound like they're not to be trifled with.  Good thing the Earth I know doesn't have any.
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,They said you're a student...but something about you seems intense.  Like you know more than you let on...
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a student.  The uniform matches...but something in your eyes doesn't.
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I know this is rude, but...something seems off about you.  What did you say you did?  You're a student?
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,For a supposed student, there's something about the way you carry yourself that makes me wary...like you're one step ahead of us.
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...Of <i>space</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Who in space makes these decisions?
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I thought you were just out in space...
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too...how's it treating you?
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  Even with a whole crew at your side...
0-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=impressed,You fly through space on an <i>observatory</i>?  Sounds...strangely luxurious.
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...With <i>magic</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  I guess <i>magic</i> would make you worthy of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=thinking,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  Well, she can't use <i>magic</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...but magic might give you a good reason to think that.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  That's rare on Mejare...you'd turn heads.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Is that common on Earth?  Few Mejarians are that way...
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Dark skin...besides Valore and Amarone, I'm not sure I know any Mejarian women like you.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=thinking,Most Mejarians are pale, but your skin is dark.  So is Valore's...but that's beside the point.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?  Especially with men's mechanical sidearms?
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot quieter than those racketous male ones.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.  She likes men's mechanical guns.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought those clunky men's guns to a card game.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...Is there a reason you keep waving those clunky kinetic guns around?  Women should know better than to use male weapons.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...You don't need to start any fights.  I certainly don't want to hear the racket of those men's sidearms you've got.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,I'll never understand Barnette's fixation on clunky men's guns...or yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,People say I never smile...are you the same way?
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You don't quite seem dressed for the occasion here.  Unless you'd rather just get it over with.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking,Just like challenging yourself, based on how little you're wearing?  I just rushed over in what I usually wear.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,At least you seem to like the attention.  Based on your outfit, you're going to attract a lot of it.
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You've got enough energy for both of us.  Neither of us is wearing very much, though...
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a student, yes?  And what does this Academy you attend teach you about?
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,My school experiences...weren't the best.  But I'm curious what you've been learning in this Academy of yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shy...that's normally what I expect from students.  What is it you've been taught, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A student?  I dropped out of school...I had to learn piloting the hard way.  What's taught in "Beacon Academy"?
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're tall for a woman.  Might give Gascogne a run for her money.
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's this "America" planet known for?  Tall women?
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You report the news?  I was on the news as a little girl...wish I wasn't.
0-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're a reporter?  It's been a while since I had a <i>positive</i> media appearance.
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,Out of everyone here, you seem remarkably...normal.  In a way, that's refreshing.
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,As far as I can tell, you're quite standard for Earth women.  Don't take that as an insult...
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Hm.  Not sure what to make of you.  You seem rather straightforward.
0-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=bored,As normal as can be...which is why I'm wary.
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
0-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  With a brooch and everything...you look the part.
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  The crown leads me in that direction...
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  That's who rules Mejare...
0-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...the title doesn't make the woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You're from some kind of ninja village, was it?  And what's a ninja, for that matter?
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=impressed,These "ninjas" of yours sound a lot like the telepathic people Hibiki got stuck with...
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,Not to be rude, but what's the significance of your facial markings?
0-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=disappointed,Facial markings...I think Rabat's people have some, too.  Not that I trust them.
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
0-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,So you do unsavory work for this old woman you know?  I work for an old woman, too...she approached <i>me</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...now we have a <i>goddess</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...feeling alright, Orendi?
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,We've never run into aliens in our travels...didn't think I'd meet one <i>here</i>.  And you're certainly alien.
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...<i>aware</i> of the rest of us?
0-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=bored,...Would you please stop shouting?  Whatever you are...
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
0-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,At least your <i>hair</i> is expressive.
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=confused,...Where's your body, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,You look like a miniature Paksis.  Any relation?
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like the Paksis sprouted wings and shrunk.
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you big enough to hold the cards?

0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?

0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.

0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you feast on men's energy, or something to that effect?  Way to confirm what Tarakkians already think.
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shapely.  Is that how a "succubus" lures men into her traps?
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=confused,Is all that really necessary?  And are those real wings?  I heard you say you were a <i>succubus</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=bored,You might actually give Jura some competition with that figure.  She's hunting for men herself...

0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
0-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.

0-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.

0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=impressed,Even for an Earth woman, that looks like pretty old-fashioned dress.  Your manners are similarly classical...
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,I could have sworn I saw you at another table than this one...guess it must have been a similarly passive woman.
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=confused,How'd you lose that bit of your finger?  You seem rather demure to be in combat...
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem very assertive.  I wouldn't think this game would attract a shy woman like you...

0-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Then why are you here?
0-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She'd never lower herself to games like this...

0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...What's this "Borg" all about?
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Borg" sounds a lot like the Harvest...taking whatever they want.
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,We used to think men were just a collective, too...maybe I shouldn't make fun.
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.
0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?

0-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and the "Borg" sounds suspiciously similar to the Harvest.  We'll watch out for them.

0-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't you have some sort of first name?  "Dark Magician Girl" is too long to say in the heat of battle.

0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
0-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.

0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You seem more like a dressed-up athlete.
0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She's certainly not as athletic as <i>you</i> look.
0-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though you might have an athletic edge on me.

0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a lawyer.  I'm assuming that means you work with the law?  Mejare's laws are absolute.
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,You "practice law," correct?  Where I come from, laws are handed down...and no one can argue them.
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,What does a lawyer do, exactly?  Mejare doesn't allow women to argue the laws...if we could, men might be considered human.
0-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare doesn't allow legal arguments...and being a pirate, I'm on the wrong side of them.  But law is what you work with, correct?
0-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...

0-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.

0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're immortal.  Is that in the sense of never aging, or never dying at all?
0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,If you really <i>can</i> wield magic, I'd be honored to learn it...it sounds useful.
0-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=calm,The Paksis has proven to me that powers beyond human ability exist...so I'm willing to believe you might have some.
0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I was told you were a spacefarer, as well...and a pilot.  Good to see a woman who understands my situation.
0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Is it true you're a space pilot?  So am I...I'd love to discuss formations or maneuvers after the game is over.

0-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,Is it true you were in cryosleep for a number of years?  So was a man I know...he looks younger than me, but he's over a hundred years old.

0-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Honestly.  You're just being coy to save face.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=disappointed,Don't give me that.  You're broken up about losing--you just pretend not to care.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Good attitude.  Just stop trying so you can claim losing doesn't bother you.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=unimpressed,If this game is all luck, shouldn't we be a little more even?  Or are you just trying to save face?
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored,The moment you've been waiting for.  Well, give our friends a good show.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored,I've given up all hope regarding your skill.  Just get to stripping.

0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored,...Just get it over with.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,I expected better from you...this is getting sad.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,I'm glad you put a little more effort into piloting than into this...not that I'm satisfied with your piloting.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,This is pathetic...cards or piloting, I taught you better than this.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Please tell me you're losing on purpose.  I'd like to maintain some respect for your intelligence, if not your modesty.

0-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you travel through space, too...and hunt space pirates.  Good luck with that.

0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,Get it together, Jura.  Unless you're just losing on purpose...
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,At least <i>try</i> to win.  Don't paint a picture of us as ditzy exhibitionists.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,Where's your focus?  I make you play poker with me and Gascogne so you'll sharpen your tactical skills...
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,Come <i>on</i>, Jura.  Don't roll over and die.  You're smarter than this.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I know you like showing off your body, but at least make them <i>earn</i> it.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,Going to remove some <i>clothes</i> this time?
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Why you bothered with your rapier is beyond me.  You <i>want</i> to be naked.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I'm actually a little curious how much clothing you've prepared for this...
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,Fashion is definitely your first love.  I'm curious how you plan to pace this out...
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Bad start.  But you have plenty to lose, I'm sure.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Something tells me you came to this game prepared.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,What's first on what I'm sure is a long list?
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,You're certainly not one to go right for large items...so I'm not expecting much.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,It begins.  Expect a long journey to nudity, everyone.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is it true you're a "mutant"?  Forgive my ignorance, but you look quite human to me.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=awkward,For a supposed mutant, you look very human.  Maybe it's an Earth custom I'm missing...
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,I was told you're a mutant.  Considering your very human appearance, I think that warrants an explanation.
0-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,Would you mind explaining what they meant when they said you're a "mutant"?  Is that just a term for some subset of Earthlings?
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, you're...a "clown"?  You shouldn't put yourself down like that...unless it's some kind of profession?
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly does a "clown" do for a living?  Are you some kind of public entertainer?
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, clowns...entertain people?  All the entertainment on Mejare tends to focus on the evils of men.
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard you were a "clown," which sounds a little degrading.  You don't seem too broken up about it, though.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,It's good to see a fellow pilot!  You even look a little like Belvedere.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...pure black is an interesting choice, if it's intentional.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...I don't think I know anyone with pure black hair.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  That black hair is imposing...as is your stark outfit.
0-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though no pilot of mine has pure black hair.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  Duero seems that way, too, even if he only shows it to Parfet.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Take that how you will.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Besides Duero, I can't picture a man sitting still.
0-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=thinking,You're into art, you said?  Artists are good to have around...they tend not to kill people.
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that headband some sort of designation?  Not to be rude.
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a "ninja"?  Sounds like the telepathic people Hibiki was stuck with.
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=bored,You're awfully quiet.  Not that I take issue with that...
0-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=confused,So these "ninjas" have their own society?  What separates you from a typical human?
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough...but magic sounds like a good motivator.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...but not about <i>magic</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
0-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,Good, you're wearing enough makeup for both of us.  Saves me the trouble.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  Might even make <i>Jura</i> jealous.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
0-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=bored,...About as much on as <i>Barnette</i> ever layers.  And she has a certain reputation for baring it all.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...at least the rest seems comfrotable for you.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.  The rest of our styles match, at least.
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_spiders=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
0-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue...I'm sure Parfet would like working with you, if you do engineering.
0-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=disappointed,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off...once she learns to pronounce "San Fransokyo."
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,So, tell me about these "Phantom Thieves."  What is it you do?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Phantom Thieves" of yours sound like pirates.  What do you steal, exactly?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,Parfet is into computers.  You said you were, too, right?  Something about "Phantom Thieves"?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing...but just as unkempt.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She wears glasses, too...and she sometimes neglects hygiene.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together...and didn't teach her how to clean herself.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build..and Parfet's glasses.  Are you old enough to be here?  You should have cleaned yourself, regardless.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds...Parfet gets like that, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,Not to be rude, but I still can't comprehend this.  Are you shaving...<i>the rest of it</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,...Is the bottom fur next?  Did you really come here naked?
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,To meet a cat-woman hybrid here, and that she's not even wearing anything...I assume what's around your groin is fur, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,You've only lost once before, but I think I know what's coming next.  If it, too, is fur...
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're aware you need <i>clothing</i> to play this game, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=confused,Did you just come here from a finished game?  You've got almost nothing on...
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=impressed,And they say <i>Mejarians</i> dress revealingly.  You barely dress at <i>all</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you meant to come dressed in a cat costume, it seems to be missing a few pieces.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type, based on those weapons.  Guess you can't trust a soldier to leave them behind, even here.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got a sweet expression for all those weapons you're carrying.  It's unsettling.
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you brought weapons here?  What kind of place is this?
0-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You're a military woman?  You've got the uncomfortably sweet expression of one, for sure.
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=confused,Are...you OK?  You're all clammed up...
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like a schoolgirl.  Are you sure you want to be here?  Is someone making you do this?
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you alright...Saki, was it?  You look so nervous...
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Saki?  That's you, right?  You've hardly said a thing...and you're turning red.
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've seen better days...and are about to see worse ones.  Are you sure you want to play this?
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,You got to school with <i>men</i>?  Can't even imagine...
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,These "vampires" of yours sound like if the Harvest were even more supernatural than it already is.  Fearsome.
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,You work with computers?  I think Parfet's dabbled with them, though she likes machinery better.  Do they help with vampires?
0-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Tell me more about these "vampires."  If they exist, I'm sure Earth will send them our way soon enough.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.  What do you use this magic for?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?  I'd like to see some...
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset...in battle and out.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=addressing,If you could teach your "magic" to me, this night might actually be worth it.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=confused,You're...a little thin on clothes to be playing this, don't you think?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  You've barely got anything on.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've heard of Valentine's Day...but that's for love, not indecency.
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=bored,Shouldn't you have come to a strip poker game...<i>clothed</i>?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=pleased,That's about how much Barnette wears with her apron.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  Quite decorated, as well.  Some type of authority, then?
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You're certainly dressed for it.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I have to ask...I don't know Earth's power structure.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...even if they dress that way.
0-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>Royalty</i>?  If you're the one ruling Earth, I suggest you stop sending the Harvest our way.
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
0-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.  Of course, Mejare's schools tried to do the same.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager...and your dress doesn't seem too protective.
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...are Earth women realy like this?
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=bored,You seem to know us all pretty well...perhaps a little <i>too</i> well, if you follow.
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,You're just flustered.
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,Get it together.
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Early-game nerves, ~name~?
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  This is going to be a bore...
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...you're no challenge at all.
0-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would eviscerate you.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...but the mechanical arm is more striking.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a fiery one.  I'm sorry about your arm...or I <i>would</i> be, if it didn't look superior to my own.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=addressing,I shouldn't pry as to how you lost your arm...but is that mechanical replacement useful?
0-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,You're a fiery one.  Like if Barnette and Jura had their child...hopefully she'd have her arm.
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=impressed,Good streak.  I almost forgot about you.
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=disappointed,You're a sneaky one...
0-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,I was wondering which of us would lose first...


#lost eyepiece
1-male_human_must_strip=calm,...
1-male_human_must_strip=pleased,One step closer towards an enlightening evening...
1-male_human_must_strip=thinking,Learning more about men can't be a bad thing...
1-male_human_must_strip=calm,Don't keep us waiting...there's a lot you could teach me.
1-male_human_must_strip=addressing,Thought you could break my focus?
1-male_human_must_strip=addressing,I'm not <i>that</i> shaken...
1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  You might as well just forfeit now.
1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...that one loss I had was clearly a fluke.
1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would just toy with you.
1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Starting to rethink things?
1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=pleased,You're more stubborn than Hibiki...
1-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Maybe men really are simpletons...
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=pleased,They always give way in the end...
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Got overconfident, ~player~?
1-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=pleased,You were doing well for a while, but nothing lasts...
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=thinking,No need to antagonize him...it's hard being alone.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,I can respect having the courage to come alone.  Jura's the only reason I came here at all...
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,Can't say I'm thrilled about a man playing at all, but at least he didn't bring friends.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=bored,Jura dragging me here at all isn't what I'd call supportive, Rinkah.
1-male_must_strip=pleased,One step closer towards an enlightening evening.
1-male_must_strip=calm,Learning more about men can't be a bad thing.
1-male_must_strip=calm,Don't keep us waiting.  There's a lot you could teach me.
1-male_must_strip=addressing,Thought you could break my focus?
1-male_must_strip=addressing,I'm not <i>that</i> shaken.
1-male_must_strip=calm,...
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why are you blindfolded?  Don't you want to see the cards?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you wearing a blindfold?  Are you really that confident?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you on a bet or something?  Take your blindfold off and play seriously.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Your outfit is one thing, but to be wearing a blindfold?  What's wrong with you?
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=impressed,You're...a <i>man</i>?  Not like one I've ever seen.
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you speaking through a translator?  Is that some archaic Earth language?
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Earth languages besides the common tongue are a mystery to me.  Even Tarakkian code is not something I've ever concerned myself with.
1-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Facial markings?  Like Rabat's people.  I'll keep that in mind, Earth-man.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard there's a female version of you.  What kept <i>her</i> away?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,And I thought <i>Bart's</i> outfits could be garish.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress more garishly than Bart.  I wonder how <i>you'd</i> look bald.
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,So, you help that girl fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
1-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,You seem immature...but then, Hibiki makes that work for himself.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,They told me you're an agent, but an agent of <i>what</i>, I'm still not sure.  Perhaps you could elaborate...and take off your weapon.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=angry,Don't think I don't see that weapon.  I'm trying to be less wary of men...but an armed "agent" puts me on edge.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's my understanding you're an agent.  Well, I'm a pirate...and I didn't come armed, so perhaps you should remove your weapon.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=bored,An "agent" of a man with a weapon at his hip is making this an uncomfortable experience already.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=pleased,I never thought I'd meet a man shorter than Hibiki...but you might be the one.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who let this...<i>child</i> in here?
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Men really do come in all shapes and sizes.  You might as well be a woman.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you?  You look like a child.  Get out.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,I'm no expert on men, but you look like a prepubescent one...never mind the cat ears.  Children aren't allowed here.
1-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,We shouldn't be playing with this child here.  This is wrong...
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,Never thought I'd meet a <i>man</i> with my fashion sense.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you were frozen for decades.  Hibiki was that way, too...
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Hibiki could certainly benefit from that...not that he'd ever accept.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Seems unbecoming of a man to take the easy way out.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,If everyone on this <i>America</i> planet is built like you, I'd hate to see the women.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you really a captain?  You seem built more to <i>take</i> orders than give them.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't need to strip for me to tell you're fit.  They'd worship you on Tarak.
1-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  You might as well just forfeit now...
1-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...that one loss I had was clearly a fluke.
1-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would just toy with you...
1-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=pleased,They always give way in the end.
1-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Got overconfident, ~name~?
1-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=pleased,You were doing well for a while, but nothing lasts.
1-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Starting to rethink things?
1-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=pleased,You're more stubborn than Hibiki.
1-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Maybe men really are simpletons.
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't trust you.  You have a nasty look in your eye.
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I've always regarded men as simple...but you look a little <i>too</i> complex.
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've learned that men aren't really animals...but something about you reminds me of one.
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look unhinged.  Always thought men were, but never saw one display it...
1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you staring at?  Look somewhere else.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Maybe you could talk to Jura...if you seemed capable of talking.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=disappointed,So you <i>can</i> speak.  What was that all about?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=annoyed,So you <i>were</i> just making fun of me...
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=bored,Grunting and screaming around women is what I'd expect from a Tarakkian.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Now</i> are you taking off that ridiculous blindfold?  Or...<i>tactical visor</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,So are you forfeiting, or are you finally deciding to let yourself see?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Attached to that blindfold?  Either give up the game or take off that thing...your move.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  You look like you can barely get yourself out of bed.
1-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Man or woman, unkempt appearances don't impress me.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Judging by his attitude, men are a lot more shy about nudity...which only makes this more curious.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=awkward,You two must be close, then.  Good to know men and women can be this comfortable around each other...I suppose.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,It's definitely a unique coincidence.  But being nude together is no issue for us...I wonder if that's true for these two.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Jura and I shower together, since the ship only has the communal bathroom...is that true for you two, as well?
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,...I've seen enough men to know you're not human.
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly...<i>are</i> you?
1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=disappointed,So <i>gay</i> is the term Earthlings use?  Sounds sort of derisive.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Can't you take this seriously, ~player~?
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,~player~, you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,You put <i>Shaggy Blanco</i> on a table with me?  Do you really hate me that much?
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I wish I could understand what you're saying.  Maybe then I'd get something out of this joke.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,At least you started working out.  You're still all unkempt.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=disappointed,White's not a popular color among Mejarians...you can imagine why.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,Not sure how to take this.  You picked <i>me</i>...but apparently I'm only worthy of playing with Shaggy Blanco.
1-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=addressing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to a joke character?  You underestimate me, ~player~.
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,What is this "Pod" you keep referring to?  What does it do?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Are you going to explain what your "Pod" is, or are we all supposed to ignore it?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll bite.  What's this "Pod" you keep mentioning?
1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm curious about this "Pod" of yours.  I suppose you wanted me to ask about that, since you said it out loud.
1-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,A "Street Fighter"...I've been in street fights.  Nothing to brag about.
1-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Eternal Fighting Champion"?  You shouldn't rest on your laurels.
1-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=impressed,I came to see a man here...you're certainly a lot of man.
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
1-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,The same person, both male and female...guess that cements it.  Men and women <i>are</i> the same species.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,I wonder what <i>I'd</i> look like as a man...horrifying.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Mejarian scientists.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=pleased,The same person, one born on Tarak and the other on Mejare.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...That's a man, Jura.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I'm no expert, but I think Corrin is a <i>man</i>, actually.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I think Corrin's a man, Jura.  Though he <i>does</i> look feminine.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Jura, do you think you could learn from this man?  Perhaps nonverbally?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't seem too talkative, but I'm told you can handle a sword.  You could stand to learn something from this man, Jura.
1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Barely talks, skilled with a sword?  Look at that, Jura.  He's everything you're not.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll be honest.  You don't look like much of a man.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought men were supposed to be tall and strong.  Of course, Hibiki proves <i>that</i> wrong...
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why do you have wings?  I <i>thought</i> men were human, but maybe not.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Children aren't allowed in here, even male ones.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really, ~player~?  You picked <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really?  Over 100 characters and you pick <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've <i>seen</i> men.  You're Kool-Aid <i>monster</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...Have some respect for yourself, ~player~.  <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Unless it's April Fool's Day, you shouldn't be picking this character.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,If this is what Earthlings find attractive, I'm glad the colonists left.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,I'm not sure how to feel about being picked by the same player who'd choose <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>.
1-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,You must really hate me to stick me on a table with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
1-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=calm,You might be handsomer if you grew your hair out.  Duero makes it work.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=impressed,Wait, you two work together?  That's...very awkward.  Jura and I split up when we came here...
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,I see even on Earth, the superiority of women is clearly entrenched.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  The captain is quite a bit older than I am...
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  I sure wouldn't want <i>Hibiki</i> playing this with me.
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Maybe I just lack the experience, but...are you a man or a woman?
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Men and women have always looked pretty distinct to me...and then there's you.
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you live underground?  Sounds claustrophobic...
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
1-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,And I thought <i>Hibiki</i> was outgoing...
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,Well...you're certainly enthusiastic.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,We're all right here.  You don't have to shout.
1-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is "captain" an actual designation, or just what you call yourself?
1-female_human_must_strip=bored,Hopefully this game will be over soon...
1-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,You cost me my eyepiece...I'm not feeling so sympathetic anymore.
1-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,Move us along, please...
1-female_human_must_strip=bored,Half-nude women are not a rare sight on the Nirvana...
1-female_human_must_strip=bored,I'm sure everyone wants to see <i>you</i> strip...
1-female_human_must_strip=calm,...
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,You've got potential, lasting so long...
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Nice run.  You've got skill...
1-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=impressed,Good streak, ~player~...perhaps I underestimated you.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  You might as well just forfeit now.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...that one loss I had was clearly a fluke.
1-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would just toy with you.
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=bored,Pull yourself together, ~player~...
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,This is getting embarrassing...
1-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Time to change tactics, ~player~...
1-female_must_strip=calm,...
1-female_must_strip=bored,Hopefully this game will be over soon.
1-female_must_strip=disappointed,You cost me my eyepiece.  I'm not feeling so sympathetic anymore.
1-female_must_strip=disappointed,Move us along, please.
1-female_must_strip=bored,Half-nude women are not a rare sight on the Nirvana.
1-female_must_strip=bored,I'm sure everyone wants to see <i>you</i> strip.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=happy,Did you slip into your native language before?  That's a little cute.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=pleased,Despite our differences, humans throughout the galaxy <i>did</i> agree on a language...
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,Was that a taste of what they speak on planet France?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,You're doing it <i>again</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,Out of everyone here, you seem remarkably...normal.  In a way, that's refreshing.
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,As far as I can tell, you're quite standard for Earth women.  Don't take that as an insult...
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Hm.  Not sure what to make of you.  You seem rather straightforward.
1-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=bored,As normal as can be...which is why I'm wary.
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,You raid tombs?  All of Earth is ancient history is Mejare, not just dead queens.
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you certainly look fit, which is good to see in a woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,<i>Tombs</i>, you said?  Not for me...too cramped.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Wha--<i>what are you doing</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't wave that thing around!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't fire that thing!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,<i>Where's your trigger discipline</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Why did you <i>bring</i> that thing?
1-female_must_strip,filter:pokemon,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_po,priority:381,marker:chi_po=awkward,<i>This</i> girl is from Poke...<i>whatever</i>?  So...these games star real people?
1-female_must_strip,filter:pokemon,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_po,priority:381,marker:chi_po=bored,...What makes you think I know what "Star Wars" is, either?
1-female_must_strip,filter:pokemon,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_po,priority:381,marker:chi_po=bored,...Money?  These games make <i>money</i>?  All the money on Mejare goes to the state...
1-female_must_strip,filter:pokemon,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_po,priority:381,marker:chi_po=awkward,Should you be talking about ~name~ like this?  If she wants to bring up...<i>whatever</i>-mon, let her do it.
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're tall for a woman.  Might give Gascogne a run for her money.
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's this "America" planet known for?  Tall women?
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You report the news?  I was on the news as a little girl...wish I wasn't.
1-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're a reporter?  It's been a while since I had a <i>positive</i> media appearance.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman.  I'm not sure if <i>Gascogne</i> could measure up to you...
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,Earth women can get pretty tall, it seems...but so can Mejarians, and I believe the gravity's the same.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think Gascogne's still got an inch on you, so don't feel self-conscious about your size.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=awkward,Do men like tall women?  I'm about middle-of-the-pack in that regard...
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,You carry yourself well for your height, though you seem a little uneasy.  Do you not get out much?
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is it true you're a "mutant"?  Forgive my ignorance, but you look quite human to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=awkward,For a supposed mutant, you look very human.  Maybe it's an Earth custom I'm missing...
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,I was told you're a mutant.  Considering your very human appearance, I think that warrants an explanation.
1-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,Would you mind explaining what they meant when they said you're a "mutant"?  Is that just a term for some subset of Earthlings?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...but the mechanical arm is more striking.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a fiery one.  I'm sorry about your arm...or I <i>would</i> be, if it didn't look superior to my own.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=addressing,I shouldn't pry as to how you lost your arm...but is that mechanical replacement useful?
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,You're a fiery one.  Like if Barnette and Jura had their child...hopefully she'd have her arm.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Men aren't all that dangerous.  Just simpletons.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Surely you've grown up around men.  I don't have <i>that</i> benefit.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=impressed,I never thought an Earth woman would be so shy around men...
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You don't quite seem dressed for the occasion here.  Unless you'd rather just get it over with.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking,Just like challenging yourself, based on how little you're wearing?  I just rushed over in what I usually wear.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,At least you seem to like the attention.  Based on your outfit, you're going to attract a lot of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You've got enough energy for both of us.  Neither of us is wearing very much, though...
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a student, yes?  And what does this Academy you attend teach you about?
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,My school experiences...weren't the best.  But I'm curious what you've been learning in this Academy of yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shy...that's normally what I expect from students.  What is it you've been taught, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A student?  I dropped out of school...I had to learn piloting the hard way.  What's taught in "Beacon Academy"?
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,...You've never played poker before?  What do Earth women do during downtime?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=impressed,You've never played poker before?  Gascogne would have a field day with you...
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,You've never played poker before, and you start with <i>strip</i> poker?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  With a brooch and everything...you look the part.
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  The crown leads me in that direction...
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  That's who rules Mejare...
1-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...the title doesn't make the woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly full of energy.  Might even rival Dita, though I could never picture her playing this.
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Wherever this <i>Australia</i> planet is, its food must be nutritious.  You're energetic.
1-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=pleased,You're pretty energetic.  That's good to see in a pilot, and I suppose Dita proves discipline isn't a necessity.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,At least your <i>hair</i> is expressive.
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
1-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=calm,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, you're...a "clown"?  You shouldn't put yourself down like that...unless it's some kind of profession?
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly does a "clown" do for a living?  Are you some kind of public entertainer?
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, clowns...entertain people?  All the entertainment on Mejare tends to focus on the evils of men.
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard you were a "clown," which sounds a little degrading.  You don't seem too broken up about it, though.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Jura.  Always bragging about her looks...although she might be more justified in doing so.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=unimpressed,Taking another inch off of the stems?  Surely you can think of another way to waste our time.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,In case you were wondering, that's twice that you should've lost now.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=annoyed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=addressing,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,<i>Now</i> are you done?  Or are you going to summon vines and perpetuate this?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Stripping your flowers now?  Any more vegetation we should know about?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Is a bush next?  Are you stripping flowers and replacing them with branches?
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,People say I never smile...are you the same way?
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...feeling alright, Orendi?
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,We've never run into aliens in our travels...didn't think I'd meet one <i>here</i>.  And you're certainly alien.
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...<i>aware</i> of the rest of us?
1-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=bored,...Would you please stop shouting?  Whatever you are...
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...now we have a <i>goddess</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.  Though it seems your world has more nature...
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.  Seems you live in a world with vegetation...
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,What are you waving that thing around for?  Guns aren't children's playthings!
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,Put the gun down, would you?  What are you so afraid of?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...An acerbic, bestial woman waving a racketous mechanical gun around.  Just how I pictured Earth women.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,I can understand wanting to be armed in a seedy place like this, but you're taking this too far.  And don't wave it around!
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
1-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,So you do unsavory work for this old woman you know?  I work for an old woman, too...she approached <i>me</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=bored,...Well, we know what your favorite color is, don't we?  Even your <i>hair</i> is purple...
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,Purple hair, purple outfit...even on Mejare, purple hair is a bit outlandish.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,I have some crewmates who wish their hair was a more exotic color, like your purple.  I suppose I should consider my blue strange...
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is that purple hair your natural color?  Where are you from?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You're from some kind of ninja village, was it?  And what's a ninja, for that matter?
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=impressed,These "ninjas" of yours sound a lot like the telepathic people Hibiki got stuck with...
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,Not to be rude, but what's the significance of your facial markings?
1-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=disappointed,Facial markings...I think Rabat's people have some, too.  Not that I trust them.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is it true you're a "princess"?  I'm told you hold some authority...which makes me question why you're here.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,I'm told you're a ruler of some sort...shouldn't you be <i>ruling</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,I hear you're an authority figure where you're from.  I'm sure your subjects appreciate you spending your time like this.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,My experience with authority has always been that they don't deserve their power...you being here reinforces that.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,I'm told you were cryogenically frozen for some time...that's also true of Misty, a young girl I know from Pluto.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,Is it true you were in cryosleep for a number of years?  So was a man I know...he looks younger than me, but he's over a hundred years old.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,Someone mentioned you were in cryosleep for some time.  It sounds uncomfortable...maybe you don't want to talk about it.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,You were cryogenically frozen, correct?  Several of my crewmates were, as well...technically making them older than any of us.
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,What was that transformation you did earlier?  That was impressive...you had a full suit on!
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Didn't you come here with a pink suit on?  How'd you take it off so quickly?  All I saw was light...
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,Did you...<i>transform</i> earlier?  What was that all about?  I'm curious...
1-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Weren't you wearing a suit like mine just before?  ...Besides the pink.  How did you transform out of it?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=disappointed,Are you feeling alright, Jura?  I've played cards with you before.  You're better than this.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=bored,Feeling under the weather, Jura?  From a card-playing perspective, anyway?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=disappointed,Are you OK, Jura?  Is there a relationship-related reason for stripping nude in front of a crowd?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=bored,Are you OK?  Is there a reason you're seeking validation from these people?  Your body is beautiful, there.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,It's good to see a fellow pilot!  You even look a little like Belvedere.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.  And she doesn't really have the wardrobe for this game...
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  Might even make <i>Jura</i> jealous.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=bored,...About as much on as <i>Barnette</i> ever layers.  And she has a certain reputation for baring it all.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Someone else with blue hair...too bad you're a soldier.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I can see two reasons why you and Jura are going to get along this evening.  And your martial arts skills aren't one of them.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  ...Apparently not with a "Borg collective."  I apologize.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...What's this "Borg" all about?
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Borg" sounds a lot like the Harvest...taking whatever they want.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,We used to think men were just a collective, too...maybe I shouldn't make fun.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Star Fleet" sounds nice.  Humans are all scattered on different planets where I'm from...though we don't have to deal with this "Borg."
1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and the "Borg" sounds suspiciously similar to the Harvest.  We'll watch out for them.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,That's quite the outfit.  You may have competition, Jura...but then, you like that.
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...look, Jura, another one.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You're a fiery one...she's how I picture your and Barnette's daughters, Jura.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of Jura here.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
1-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,...I'm sorry, you said you were a <i>genie</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly is a "genie"?
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Is "genie" some kind of Earth race?
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Amarone never calls herself a genie...
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Valore never called herself a genie...
1-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  B.C. never calls herself a genie...but then, she doesn't exactly count.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> chilly, Jura.  At least I show my face.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Clearly I need to show less emotion, then.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You're right.  I could really improve my stoicism by watching her.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A <i>concession</i>?  I thought you were going to tease me all night.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I'm sure she has her reasons.  Stoicism is important for a leader...
1-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Amarone.
1-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Valore.

1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  Rabat probably considers himself one.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  I can appreciate getting the job done quickly.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=bored,An assassin...there's nothing subtle about our Dreads, unfortunately.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,As assassin, you said?  One of the reasons I prefer Mejarian laser rigns is their subtlety.

1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe <i>you</i> could flirt with her and bring her back.  Barnette could use some target practice.

1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Mejare has detectives...but they mostly investigate enemies of the state.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Anyone who focuses on discovering secrets is probably hiding a few themselves.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  Are men any good in school?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  More nuanced than Mejare's, I hope.

1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you travel through space, too...and hunt space pirates.  Good luck with that.
1-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,There's a pirate named Rabat I wouldn't mind you catching for us...since you travel through space.

1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot quieter than those racketous male ones.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.  She likes men's mechanical guns.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought those clunky men's guns to a card game.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...Is there a reason you keep waving those clunky kinetic guns around?  Women should know better than to use male weapons.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...You don't need to start any fights.  I certainly don't want to hear the racket of those men's sidearms you've got.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,I'll never understand Barnette's fixation on clunky men's guns...or yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outift that attracts men?  If so, Jura will have an easy time finding one.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Jura certainly does, but I've never seen eye-to-eye with her.

1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  That's rare on Mejare...you'd turn heads.
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Is that common on Earth?  Few Mejarians are that way...
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Dark skin...besides Valore and Amarone, I'm not sure I know any Mejarian women like you.

1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.  As well as letting you change outfits.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford a wardrobe change, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,I should have expected a wealthy woman to change her wardrobe...I would, too, if I owned anything.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,You work in a team of women?  And your outfit is different...we don't really have uniforms, either.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself.  And has the finances to vary her outfit.
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...With <i>magic</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  I guess <i>magic</i> would make you worthy of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=thinking,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  Well, she can't use <i>magic</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...but magic might give you a good reason to think that.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...our outfits tend to vary, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...you've got some strange outfits yourselves.

1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And dress herself in different ways.

1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,What do you think, Jura?  Should we have our arms replaced with robotics?

1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=bored,I guess all that teasing really did the trick, Jura.  ~player~ loves you enough to put another one.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=unimpressed,Good.  Twice the vanity, half the responsibility.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=thinking,I don't make any effort to look beautiful, so I see why ~player~ would want two of you instead...

1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it...is this how people dress there?

1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like Paiway dressed up as a fairy.  Are you old enough to be here?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I read about fairies as a girl.  They protected Mejarian children from marauding packs of men.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,A <i>fairy</i>?  Earth never fails to surprise me with its species variety.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a fairy?  I'd need to see something spectacular for you to match the stories I've heard.

1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.

1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
1-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.

1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
1-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.  Of course, Mejare's schools tried to do the same.
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue...I'm sure Parfet would like working with you, if you do engineering.
1-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=disappointed,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off...once she learns to pronounce "San Fransokyo."
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  You look like you're about to cast off that dress and go running.
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You seem more like a dressed-up athlete.
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She's certainly not as athletic as <i>you</i> look.
1-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though you might have an athletic edge on me.
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,Someone said you gave up on school.  So did I...
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like you get a lot of exercise.  Always good to see in a woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=disappointed,You said something about a <i>killer</i>?  Earth's no stranger to killing, as far as I'm concerned.
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Congratulations, ~player~.  You've found what are probably my rarest lines.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  You must really like me, ~player~.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  Honestly, ~player~, that's a little flattering.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=pleased,I see Earth has also perfected cloning technology.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Glad you appreciate me enough to play with more than one of me.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  That's...a little cute, ~player~.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,More than one of me?  Considering my responsibilities, that would really help.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,Would you look at that, ~player~'s figured out the offline version.  And apparently is very fond of me.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,More than one Meia?  How flattering.  Be sure to try out Jura, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Never thought I'd say <i>these</i> lines.  I'm glad you like me so much, ~player~.  That's sweet.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,You said you were a "Street Fighter," correct?  I suppose that <i>would</i> get you into shape.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,You said something about street fighting?  I've been in street fights.  I'd rather not go back to that, but if you like it...
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You said you're a street fighter?  That's a harsh life...I lived on the streets when I was younger.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,Street fighting isn't the kind of thing I'd glorify, but if it makes you happy...just take care of yourself.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...at least the rest seems comfrotable for you.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.  The rest of our styles match, at least.
1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_spiders=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,You look like you're in great shape.  I respect that in a woman...very much.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Not to be too forward, but...your legs are so muscular.  What's your training routine?
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Wow...whatever you do to exercise, I'd like to learn it.  You look fantastic.
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman, and in a good way.  Could I get your frame with enough training?
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Your build is impressive...and I wouldn't say to that to <i>any</i> strange woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
1-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,...What in Ma's name am I looking at?  Are you <i>human</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I'll be perfectly honest.  You look inhuman.
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,Er...what <i>are</i> you, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I thought the <i>Harvest</i> was terrifying.  My God.
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...and you don't seem happy to be here.
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that...since you seem annoyed regardless.
1-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here...and you seem miserable about it, anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're some kind of covert agent?  I'd be lying if I said I was good at sniffing those out.
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,Speaking of covert agents...I think we gave B.C. a newfound respect for women.
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,The Nirvana's had its share of covert agents.  They tend to warm up to our cause.
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=impressed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  I suppose the Paksis isn't all that different...
1-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  We've had our issues with hostile red light in the past.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're aware you need <i>clothing</i> to play this game, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=confused,Did you just come here from a finished game?  You've got almost nothing on...
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=impressed,And they say <i>Mejarians</i> dress revealingly.  You barely dress at <i>all</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you meant to come dressed in a cat costume, it seems to be missing a few pieces.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,Not to be rude, but I still can't comprehend this.  Are you shaving...<i>the rest of it</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,...Is the bottom fur next?  Did you really come here naked?
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,To meet a cat-woman hybrid here, and that she's not even wearing anything...I assume what's around your groin is fur, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,You've only lost once before, but I think I know what's coming next.  If it, too, is fur...
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons...or another dress, at least.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=confused,You're...a little thin on clothes to be playing this, don't you think?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  You've barely got anything on.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've heard of Valentine's Day...but that's for love, not indecency.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=bored,Shouldn't you have come to a strip poker game...<i>clothed</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=pleased,That's about how much Barnette wears with her apron.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You said you come from the plains?  Sounds nice...Mejare's not very verdant, and Tarak's even worse.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You come from the plains, you said?  My parents took me to the plains when I was a little girl...it was fun to run around.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,The plains, you said you lived in?  Somehow I doubt the Earth I know has any green left...
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I was told you were a spacefarer, as well...and a pilot.  Good to see a woman who understands my situation.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Is it true you're a space pilot?  So am I...I'd love to discuss formations or maneuvers after the game is over.
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're a pilot.  I never expected to meet a woman like that here...what's your ship like?
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I heard you're a space pilot.  I command a Dread squadron myself...what is it that you do?
1-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone told me you're a space pilot.  I've really fallen in love with piloting myself, though I only have a few years' experience...
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,This "magic" of yours sounds pretty interesting.  Can it be taught?
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're immortal.  Is that in the sense of never aging, or never dying at all?
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,If you really <i>can</i> wield magic, I'd be honored to learn it...it sounds useful.
1-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=calm,The Paksis has proven to me that powers beyond human ability exist...so I'm willing to believe you might have some.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that a camera?  Paiway, our child nurse, is always skulking around with hers...so this is nothing new.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=bored,A camera?  Are you really going to photograph us all?  ...Whatever.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you trying to blackmail us with that camera?  I've been in the media for far worse than this.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hope you don't think you're going to embarrass me with that camera.  I'm not exactly from here, anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=impressed,Even for an Earth woman, that looks like pretty old-fashioned dress.  Your manners are similarly classical...
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,I could have sworn I saw you at another table than this one...guess it must have been a similarly passive woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=confused,How'd you lose that bit of your finger?  You seem rather demure to be in combat...
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem very assertive.  I wouldn't think this game would attract a shy woman like you...
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a..."princess"?  For nobility, you don't seem too informed...
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Then why are you here?
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She'd never lower herself to games like this...
1-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though I suppose you're lowering yourself by playing this.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm a pirate, too...small universe we live in.
1-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  Well...the outfit is certainly different, and apparently the manner.
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,You...what <i>are</i> you?  Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.  What <i>are</i> you, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...I hope you don't think the floating and lack of eyes is normal to us.  Or maybe it <i>is</i> on Earth...
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
1-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=confused,"Dark Magician Girl"?  That's some sort of <i>title</i>, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't you have some sort of first name?  "Dark Magician Girl" is too long to say in the heat of battle.
1-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Dark Magician <i>Girl</i>?  Children aren't allowed here.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing...but just as unkempt.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She wears glasses, too...and she sometimes neglects hygiene.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together...and didn't teach her how to clean herself.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build..and Parfet's glasses.  Are you old enough to be here?  You should have cleaned yourself, regardless.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds...Parfet gets like that, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
1-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
1-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, this'll be interesting.  How do you plan on stretching your outfit thin?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Still wondering what your plan is here...there isn't much to your dress.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,I figure you've got lots of trinkets, but only Barnette knows for sure...
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,If you think I know what you're going to strip, I don't watch you undress in the showers with enough interest.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...You can't be serious.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...<i>Excuse me</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...Can't you take this seriously?  Can't you <i>pretend</i> to do so?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,I--who are you?  How'd you get in here?
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So, you're...some sort of "princess"?  Not sure I know what that is...
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So...does "princess" mean "light dresser"?  That would make more than a few of my crewmates princesses.
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,...Could you explain what a "princess" is?  I'm...not from Earth, so I don't know its titles.
1-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is a "princess" a position of power on Earth?  You'd think an authority figure would wear more clothing...
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You were trapped...in a computer?  I guess we were trapped in the Paksis once...
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live in a...muh-more-puh-guh?
1-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is this "muh-more-puh-guh" how Earthlings pass the time?  You should be working.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Well, if I had to guess...your boots.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your boots.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I'd really rather just focus on the cards...your shoes, maybe?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Whatever I say, you'll probably pick something else to spite me...your boots.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,You just want attention...
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,I wanted a challenge, and I get <i>you</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,Just looking over here...
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,For God's sake...
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,Sure you should take this so lightly?  You only have so many accessories left.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Is it your <i>goal</i> to be naked?  Wouldn't you rather win?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,Soon you'll be out of small things, Jura.  That dress will have to go all at once.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,I see your strategy, but it's only going to make them want to strip you even more.
1-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you feast on men's energy, or something to that effect?  Way to confirm what Tarakkians already think.
1-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shapely.  Is that how a "succubus" lures men into her traps?
1-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=confused,Is all that really necessary?  And are those real wings?  I heard you say you were a <i>succubus</i>...
1-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=bored,You might actually give Jura some competition with that figure.  She's hunting for men herself...
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you report the news?  Mejare's news agencies are all state propaganda.
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,I'm not a fan of the media...my family has had some bad publicity on Mejare.
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're <i>reporting</i> this?  The last time I appeared on television, I was a little girl...
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I appeared on Mejarian television not too far back.  We were raiding an armory.
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see a woman who shares my fashion sense...though it looks like a tight fit.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  Duero seems that way, too, even if he only shows it to Parfet.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Take that how you will.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Besides Duero, I can't picture a man sitting still.
1-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=thinking,You're into art, you said?  Artists are good to have around...they tend not to kill people.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type...though a rather unintimidating one.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  You <i>claim</i> to protect, but only when it suits you.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=bored,Oh, perfect.  A soldier.  Try not to kill anyone for fun before the game is over.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The ones I know enjoy indoctrinating children and shutting down housing districts.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Is it your dress now?  ...No, doesn't look like it.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,I think I can see what's next...and it isn't your dress.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,You're slipping, Jura.  Don't give up...you only have one small thing left, from the looks of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your wall of accessories seems to be breaking down.  The cards are the only way to win.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,Are you a student...?  I went to state schools on Mejare when I was a little girl...
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,Are you a student...?  How do men behave in school, anyway?
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.
1-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,Are you a student?  I dropped out of school...
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
1-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=pleased,Barnette's got green hair, too...but that's with the help of Mejarian genetic engineering.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=calm,Green hair isn't that strange on Mejare.  One of my pilots has it.  What about Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=impressed,Is your hair naturally green?  That'd be impressive for an Earth woman...
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type, based on those weapons.  Guess you can't trust a soldier to leave them behind, even here.
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got a sweet expression for all those weapons you're carrying.  It's unsettling.
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you brought weapons here?  What kind of place is this?
1-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You're a military woman?  You've got the uncomfortably sweet expression of one, for sure.
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why is your skin pink?  Do you have a medical condition?  Earth is no stranger to poisoning populations it doesn't care for...
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...and you look a little sickly with that skin.  Were you poisoned?  Did Earth do this to you?
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you alright?  Your skin...it's pink, and it looks unhealthy.  I wouldn't put it past Earth to do this to undesirables...
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Are you...feeling OK?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You...<i>want</i> to strip?
1-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,I...who <i>are</i> you?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,Do you have someone to support you?  This switching can't be good for your mental health...or physical.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=calm,Your blonde version seems liable to get you killed.  Do you have friends?  Colleagues?  Are you alright?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,I'd hate to see you wander around with your...condition.  Are you sure you're safe, always switching as you do?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=thinking,Earth women are full of surprises...do you want to live on the Nirvana, just to have some support?
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,Good, you're wearing enough makeup for both of us.  Saves me the trouble.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we won't be here long.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=confused,Are you counting each bandage as one layer?  If not, this'll be over soon.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really wasn't counting on seeing nudity this quickly.  At least it's a woman.
1-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Did I just walk in on a game that's nearly over?
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Sorry to be insulting, but you look rather unevenly-proportioned.  You should exercise more.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look you're giving everyone?  This is just a game.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,I'm trying not to comment on your body...Mejarians tend to be judgmental enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you seems off.  I'd suggest you relax.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager...and your dress doesn't seem too protective.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...are Earth women realy like this?
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=bored,You seem to know us all pretty well...perhaps a little <i>too</i> well, if you follow.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'm told you hold some authority in a military organization.  I hope you're using that responsibly.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,A military woman?  Excuse me for not being impressed.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You don't seem quite as fiercely repulsive as the woman soldiers I've come to know.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,Military...nothing worse than having a soldier around.  Try not to kill anyone.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a lawyer.  I'm assuming that means you work with the law?  Mejare's laws are absolute.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,You "practice law," correct?  Where I come from, laws are handed down...and no one can argue them.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,What does a lawyer do, exactly?  Mejare doesn't allow women to argue the laws...if we could, men might be considered human.
1-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare doesn't allow legal arguments...and being a pirate, I'm on the wrong side of them.  But law is what you work with, correct?
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
1-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Bless you--oh, <i>no</i>.  Don't tell me...
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Not <i>this</i> again.  The blonde version?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,God bless you--oh, damn it.  She's changed back...
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Bless--damn it, that was Launch.  Here we go again...
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=confused,...Where's your body, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,You look like a miniature Paksis.  Any relation?
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like the Paksis sprouted wings and shrunk.
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you big enough to hold the cards?
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=impressed,These "Evas" I've heard of actually seem like impressive technology.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You said something about "Evas" before?  My Dread sounds a lot more reliable...but still, they sound fearsome.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Evas" sound like they're not to be trifled with.  Good thing the Earth I know doesn't have any.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...pure black is an interesting choice, if it's intentional.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...I don't think I know anyone with pure black hair.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  That black hair is imposing...as is your stark outfit.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though no pilot of mine has pure black hair.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.  What do you use this magic for?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?  I'd like to see some...
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset...in battle and out.
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=addressing,If you could teach your "magic" to me, this night might actually be worth it.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough...but magic sounds like a good motivator.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...but not about <i>magic</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
1-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that headband some sort of designation?  Not to be rude.
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a "ninja"?  Sounds like the telepathic people Hibiki was stuck with.
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=bored,You're awfully quiet.  Not that I take issue with that...
1-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=confused,So these "ninjas" have their own society?  What separates you from a typical human?
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,They said you're a student...but something about you seems intense.  Like you know more than you let on...
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a student.  The uniform matches...but something in your eyes doesn't.
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I know this is rude, but...something seems off about you.  What did you say you did?  You're a student?
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,For a supposed student, there's something about the way you carry yourself that makes me wary...like you're one step ahead of us.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.
1-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,"Black Canary"?  I <i>wish</i> Mejare had canaries...
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.  Although it would seem your outfit is branching out.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=calm,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...say, you look a little different than before.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And is it just me, or did you dress up for this?
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides the outfits.
1-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about your outfit seems unusual for you...strange, since I've never met you before.
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
1-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  Quite decorated, as well.  Some type of authority, then?
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You're certainly dressed for it.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I have to ask...I don't know Earth's power structure.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...even if they dress that way.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>Royalty</i>?  If you're the one ruling Earth, I suggest you stop sending the Harvest our way.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak...that's why its soldiers are so ruthless, even to us.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman...but military service <i>isn't</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soldiers...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.
1-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'll try to reserve judgment...but know that it's a rare soldier that earns anything but my contempt.
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off.  What <i>planet</i> are you from?
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,That's an...interesting skin color.  And speech pattern.  Who <i>are</i> you, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that...
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She's blind without her glasses, too...no mystery there.  But you solve those, yes?
1-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Are you any good with machines?  Or purely a mystery-solver?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Earth was devastated many years ago, so it started using its colonies as organ farms.  Mejare is the uterus colony...so there's no men.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=thinking,We've come to know a few men, actually...but Earth's organ-harvesting is why Mejare is nothing but women.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Mejare is just one of Earth's many colonies.  It was intentionally settled as women-only for Earth to harvest reproductive organs.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,Jura wanted to come here <i>because</i> we don't know much about men.  Earth harvests uteri from Mejare, so there's no need for them.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,What's that phrase you keep saying?  "Plus Ultra"?  What does that mean?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,Why do you keep saying "Plus Ultra"?  Is that some sort of battle cry?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=calm,...What's the meaning of that "Plus Ultra" phrase you keep repeating?  Is it for teambuilding or just personal confidence?
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's, and your sword like Jura's here.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.  But the sword is distinctly Jura.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, learn from this woman and actually use your sword properly.
1-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,As long as you've got that sword, could you teach Jura how to use it?  That rapier of hers is just for show.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford that, if you wanted.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,Haven't you played cards before?  Aren't you wealthy enough to own a <i>casino</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though you've probably got more money than my whole crew.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  Even if it's only on finances.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, take instructions from this woman so you can actually put that rapier to use.
1-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--how could anyone be so--<i>are you serious</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,What a disgusting woman, offering so bluntly...wait, <i>you're letting her</i>?
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Unbelievable that someone could be so lecherous...wait, <i>what</i>?  Don't let her touch you!
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Wha--Jura, you don't even know this woman!  Don't let her near you!  Doesn't this place have rules about that?
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too?  Until recently we never got far past the Mejarian system.
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,It took an accidental wormhole to actually fling us out of the Mejarian system.  <i>Your</i> Earth is a lot more adventurous.
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Everyone on Earth, exploring space in peace and harmony?  This Star Fleet sounds nice.  Tarak and Mejare can't even unite the sexes.
1-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll agree that traveling through space teaches you a lot about other civilizations.  The colonies we've run into have all been different.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=interested,The whole suit, then?  I don't plan on being pushed that far, but my heart goes out to you.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,Seems your suit is next, Ochako.  I understand how you must be feeling, as you can see.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,Best not to drag this out, Ochako...not if your suit is next.  I understand the awkwardness.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,My fullest sympathies, Ochako.  It can be hard zipping the whole thing off in public.
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=impressed,You go to school for "magic"?  That...sounds rather fascinating, actually.
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun...but I suppose magic would have made it easier.
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't have good memories of school...maybe you could talk about your magic instead?
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm told you can use magic.  Sometimes the Paksis feels that way...we certainly never had any schooling on the subject.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Wha--<i>don't bring up Misty</i>!  It's not like she'll understand.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,You--I--Misty and I are not an <i>item</i>.  I just give her advice.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You know perfectly well Misty's into <i>men</i>, Jura...and also that she's too young.
1-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Why do you try to twist my relationship with Misty into love?  She just...needs guidance.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Assuming that style exists anywhere, it's too conspicuous.  This coloration blends into machinery.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,She can be as bubbly as she wants.  I doubt she has the responsibilities you or I carry.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,She looks young, Jura...and in a better position.  She can afford to be happy, so let her.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wherever she comes from, I'm sure that pattern is optimal.  She must wear it for a reason.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I just don't understand.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,You can't run away from your problems, Florina...I've tried.
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,I appreciate women that stand their ground against their fears...
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,Running away doesn't solve anything...your fears can always run faster.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't antagonize her, Jura.  I can respect a woman who understands the value of silence.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You could do to learn from me or her when it comes to occasionally being quiet.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You can't learn anything from talking, Jura.  Kyoko's being smart, listening in on us...
1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,She <i>does</i> have my temperament.  Don't take that as an insult, Kyoko...more women should listen to others.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Let me guess.  You're going to take off your underwear.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,I'm expecting a mundane display.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Here we go again...
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,This is how Jura treats <i>everyone</i>.  She's quite proud of herself...and to be fair, no disasters have struck because of her.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,I'll start reprimanding Jura when she starts getting women killed.  For now it's just an annoyance.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,I'm the squadron leader, yes, but Jura's second-in-command.  Besides, she hasn't gotten anyone killed yet...
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Jura's second-in-command.  She usually does her job...she just tends to get distracted with <i>this</i> sort of thing during downtime.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?  ...Or without a body?
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm told you're into art.  If you want that life-sized portrait, Jura, here's your chance.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
1-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So does Jura here.  Fire away.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  This is your chance, Jura.  Make connections.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,You've got potential, lasting so long.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Nice run.  You've got skill.
1-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=impressed,Good streak, ~name~.  Perhaps I underestimated you.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
1-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's this about wrestling?  ...Sounds like a male pursuit.  Physical posturing...
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Interesting skin color.  Are you even human?  Or an Earthling?
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare has strange hair colors...apparently Earth has strange <i>skin</i> colors.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confused,I'm not sure what's more distracting: the skin color, or the wings.  Are you from Earth?
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really thought this was Planet Earth.  I wasn't aware people here could be so...colorful.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,Jura's no fighter, but something tells me you and she would get along.  Two things, actually.
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
1-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  What do you think, Jura?  Was it for owning an anatomy book?
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...like us.
1-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Good to see another woman who shares my fashion sense.  Even the color scheme is close...
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,My bodysuit is pretty standard among Mejarian styles...but looking at you, maybe it was inspired by Earth.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Bodysuits are comfortable, aren't they?  And efficient, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,That bodysuit of yours looks awfully similar to my own.  I don't think I could pull off that helmet, though.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you're the type who clings to the past, ~player~.  That isn't healthy.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you aware there's a superior Velma character now, ~player~?  Don't cling to nostalgia like a fool.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and inform you there's a better Velma available for play now, ~player~.  This is Velma Classic.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=bored,Still using the inferior characters of the past, just because they're comfortable...listen, ~player~, the game has evolved.  So should you.
1-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Velma Classic is just here for posterity, ~player~.  The Velma of today is far more on-model.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,The same person, both male and female...that shreds any doubts I had about men and women being the same species.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,I wonder what Hibiki would look like as a woman...probably taller, honestly.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Tarakkian scientists.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,The same person, one born on Mejare and the other on Tarak.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women, and I'm not sure which one is prettier.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches Jura's.  So does your intensity.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,You're a fiery one...like if Barnette and Jura had their child, finally.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of some of my crewmates.
1-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
1-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=thinking,Time travel...if it's true, I'm curious what you've actually used it for.  Unless you'd rather hide that...
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What are those sounds you keep making?  Is that the language of...whatever planet you come from?
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,I can barely understand you...verbally <i>and</i> physically.
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's with your speech?  You keep making these odd sounds in places...
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=confused,You're...<i>streaming</i> this?  I don't understand.
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you talking to?
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  Whatever, no one knows who I am anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  They might recognize me on Mejare, but not Earth...
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Guess I'm getting a <i>Wanted</i> mugshot tonight.
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't like publicity...not one bit.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
1-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,See what too much makeup leads to, Jura?  You shouldn't concern yourself with it.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outfit that attracts men?  You'll have an easy time finding a man, then, Jura.
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Talk to Jura about it...
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work as a <i>model</i>?  You and Jura here should talk.
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Isn't that you've always wanted, Jura?
1-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Seems Earth women are capable of being vain, too, Jura...and models.  Have fun with this girl.
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,You got to school with <i>men</i>?  Can't even imagine...
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,These "vampires" of yours sound like if the Harvest were even more supernatural than it already is.  Fearsome.
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,You work with computers?  I think Parfet's dabbled with them, though she likes machinery better.  Do they help with vampires?
1-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Tell me more about these "vampires."  If they exist, I'm sure Earth will send them our way soon enough.
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,Videl...you keep mentioning your "dad."  What's a dad?
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...what's a father?
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Oh, good, another Meia.  Now I can take a day off of bossing Jura around.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Look at that, Jura.  The worst day of your life.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Playing with more than one of me is sweet.  Have you extended the same love to Jura here?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,I'm glad you like me enough to play with more than one of me, ~player~.  Do you like Jura, too?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  You might as well just forfeit now...
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...that one loss I had was clearly a fluke.
1-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Gascogne would just toy with you...
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I suppose.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=confused,Let's make sure I understand this.  You go to a whole <i>school</i> of people with powers like yours?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2,marker:dropout=thinking,I actually dropped out of school as a girl...perhaps if that school was full of women with superpowers, I might have stayed.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I'm very curious about this "Academy" of yours.  And every student has powers like you do?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=thinking,School was never a pleasant experience for me...but then, I didn't have superpowers.  What's this Academy of yours like, exactly?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You seem like you're getting nervous.  Is something wrong, Ochako?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,...Ochako, you're blushing.  A lot.  What's the matter?
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=confused,...Aren't you just taking your belt off?  What's the matter?  You're beet red.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You're blushing, Ochako...and sweating, too.  Is something wrong?  Do you need help?
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=bored,Pull yourself together, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,This is getting embarrassing.
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Time to change tactics, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...though you look like you're in a hurry to remove it.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=bored,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...but you seem quite comfortable yourself.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you're having fun already, even despite that strange green skin.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=bored,I was about to ask about your green skin, but it just seems to be your natural complexion.  You're certainly having fun as we speak.
1-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you smirking about all the time?  Just comfortable in your own...<i>green</i> skin?
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I don't think people will be confused.  This woman seems a lot more well-known on this planet.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,One letter can make all the difference...just like one mistake.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,If you actually got us confused, I'd have Duero check your eyes before you posed a danger to the team.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I trust my second-in-command to track the subtle differences between Mei and I.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.  And you don't really have the wardrobe for this game...
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.

2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Can't believe I've lost twice before this.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...how embarrassing.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  What a hollow victory.
2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=pleased,Even Hibiki would change strategy at this point...
2-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Getting bored?

2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=smug,Overthought things?
2-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=pleased,You were winning for a while there...

2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,I can respect having the courage to come alone.  Jura's the only reason I came here at all...

2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,The same person, both male and female...guess that cements it.  Men and women <i>are</i> the same species.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,I wonder what <i>I'd</i> look like as a man...horrifying.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Mejarian scientists.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=pleased,The same person, one born on Tarak and the other on Mejare.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard there's a female version of you.  What kept <i>her</i> away?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,And I thought <i>Bart's</i> outfits could be garish.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress more garishly than Bart.  I wonder how <i>you'd</i> look bald.
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=impressed,You're...a <i>man</i>?  Not like one I've ever seen.
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you speaking through a translator?  Is that some archaic Earth language?
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Earth languages besides the common tongue are a mystery to me.  Even Tarakkian code is not something I've ever concerned myself with.
2-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Facial markings?  Like Rabat's people.  I'll keep that in mind, Earth-man.
2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Overthought things?
2-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=pleased,You were winning for a while there.

2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  You look like you can barely get yourself out of bed.
2-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Man or woman, unkempt appearances don't impress me.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,What is this "Pod" you keep referring to?  What does it do?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Are you going to explain what your "Pod" is, or are we all supposed to ignore it?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll bite.  What's this "Pod" you keep mentioning?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm curious about this "Pod" of yours.  I suppose you wanted me to ask about that, since you said it out loud.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=disappointed,So you <i>can</i> speak.  What was that all about?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=annoyed,So you <i>were</i> just making fun of me...
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=bored,Grunting and screaming around women is what I'd expect from a Tarakkian.
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
2-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=calm,You might be handsomer if you grew your hair out.  Duero makes it work.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Can't you take this seriously, ~player~?
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,~player~, you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,You put <i>Shaggy Blanco</i> on a table with me?  Do you really hate me that much?
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I wish I could understand what you're saying.  Maybe then I'd get something out of this joke.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,At least you started working out.  You're still all unkempt.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=disappointed,White's not a popular color among Mejarians...you can imagine why.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,Not sure how to take this.  You picked <i>me</i>...but apparently I'm only worthy of playing with Shaggy Blanco.
2-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=addressing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to a joke character?  You underestimate me, ~player~.
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Can't believe I've lost twice before this...
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...how embarrassing.
2-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  What a hollow victory...
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Maybe I just lack the experience, but...are you a man or a woman?
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Men and women have always looked pretty distinct to me...and then there's you.
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you live underground?  Sounds claustrophobic...
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
2-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Now</i> are you taking off that ridiculous blindfold?  Or...<i>tactical visor</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,So are you forfeiting, or are you finally deciding to let yourself see?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Attached to that blindfold?  Either give up the game or take off that thing...your move.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,So, you help that girl fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
2-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,You seem immature...but then, Hibiki makes that work for himself.
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,...I've seen enough men to know you're not human.
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly...<i>are</i> you?
2-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=disappointed,So <i>gay</i> is the term Earthlings use?  Sounds sort of derisive.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Jura, do you think you could learn from this man?  Perhaps nonverbally?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't seem too talkative, but I'm told you can handle a sword.  You could stand to learn something from this man, Jura.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Barely talks, skilled with a sword?  Look at that, Jura.  He's everything you're not.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,They told me you're an agent, but an agent of <i>what</i>, I'm still not sure.  Perhaps you could elaborate...and take off your weapon.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=angry,Don't think I don't see that weapon.  I'm trying to be less wary of men...but an armed "agent" puts me on edge.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's my understanding you're an agent.  Well, I'm a pirate...and I didn't come armed, so perhaps you should remove your weapon.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=bored,An "agent" of a man with a weapon at his hip is making this an uncomfortable experience already.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't trust you.  You have a nasty look in your eye.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I've always regarded men as simple...but you look a little <i>too</i> complex.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've learned that men aren't really animals...but something about you reminds me of one.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look unhinged.  Always thought men were, but never saw one display it...
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you staring at?  Look somewhere else.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,A "Street Fighter"...I've been in street fights.  Nothing to brag about.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Eternal Fighting Champion"?  You shouldn't rest on your laurels.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=impressed,I came to see a man here...you're certainly a lot of man.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...That's a man, Jura.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I'm no expert, but I think Corrin is a <i>man</i>, actually.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I think Corrin's a man, Jura.  Though he <i>does</i> look feminine.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll be honest.  You don't look like much of a man.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought men were supposed to be tall and strong.  Of course, Hibiki proves <i>that</i> wrong...
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why do you have wings?  I <i>thought</i> men were human, but maybe not.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Children aren't allowed in here, even male ones.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=impressed,Wait, you two work together?  That's...very awkward.  Jura and I split up when we came here...
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,I see even on Earth, the superiority of women is clearly entrenched.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  The captain is quite a bit older than I am...
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  I sure wouldn't want <i>Hibiki</i> playing this with me.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really, ~player~?  You picked <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really?  Over 100 characters and you pick <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've <i>seen</i> men.  You're Kool-Aid <i>monster</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...Have some respect for yourself, ~player~.  <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Unless it's April Fool's Day, you shouldn't be picking this character.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,If this is what Earthlings find attractive, I'm glad the colonists left.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,I'm not sure how to feel about being picked by the same player who'd choose <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>.
2-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,You must really hate me to stick me on a table with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Judging by his attitude, men are a lot more shy about nudity...which only makes this more curious.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=awkward,You two must be close, then.  Good to know men and women can be this comfortable around each other...I suppose.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,It's definitely a unique coincidence.  But being nude together is no issue for us...I wonder if that's true for these two.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Jura and I shower together, since the ship only has the communal bathroom...is that true for you two, as well?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why are you blindfolded?  Don't you want to see the cards?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you wearing a blindfold?  Are you really that confident?
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you on a bet or something?  Take your blindfold off and play seriously.
2-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Your outfit is one thing, but to be wearing a blindfold?  What's wrong with you?
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Maybe you could talk to Jura...if you seemed capable of talking.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,Never thought I'd meet a <i>man</i> with my fashion sense.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you were frozen for decades.  Hibiki was that way, too...
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Hibiki could certainly benefit from that...not that he'd ever accept.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Seems unbecoming of a man to take the easy way out.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,If everyone on this <i>America</i> planet is built like you, I'd hate to see the women.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you really a captain?  You seem built more to <i>take</i> orders than give them.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't need to strip for me to tell you're fit.  They'd worship you on Tarak.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=pleased,I never thought I'd meet a man shorter than Hibiki...but you might be the one.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who let this...<i>child</i> in here?
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Men really do come in all shapes and sizes.  You might as well be a woman.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you?  You look like a child.  Get out.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,I'm no expert on men, but you look like a prepubescent one...never mind the cat ears.  Children aren't allowed here.
2-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,We shouldn't be playing with this child here.  This is wrong...
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,And I thought <i>Hibiki</i> was outgoing...
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,Well...you're certainly enthusiastic.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,We're all right here.  You don't have to shout.
2-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is "captain" an actual designation, or just what you call yourself?
2-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,You've got to play better, ~player~...
2-female_human_must_strip=calm,Don't blame your luck, or you'll never improve.
2-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,Well, don't just roll over and die...
2-female_human_must_strip=calm,All games boil down to skill, even this one.
2-female_human_must_strip=pleased,I'll just treat this like our daily pilot rollcall...
2-female_human_must_strip=calm,...
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Was that skill...or just a lucky streak?
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Do have it in you for another streak like that?
2-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,More runs like that, and you'll blow us all away...
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,<i>Focus</i>, ~player~...
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,You'll burn out if you keep playing like this...
2-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Surely you don't want to go out like this...
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Can't believe I've lost twice before this.
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...how embarrassing.
2-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  What a hollow victory.
2-female_must_strip=calm,...
2-female_must_strip=disappointed,You've got to play better, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip=disappointed,Don't blame your luck, or you'll never improve.
2-female_must_strip=disappointed,Well, don't just roll over and die...
2-female_must_strip=calm,All games boil down to skill, even this one.
2-female_must_strip=addressing,I'll just treat this like our daily pilot rollcall.
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You're from some kind of ninja village, was it?  And what's a ninja, for that matter?
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=impressed,These "ninjas" of yours sound a lot like the telepathic people Hibiki got stuck with...
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,Not to be rude, but what's the significance of your facial markings?
2-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=disappointed,Facial markings...I think Rabat's people have some, too.  Not that I trust them.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=bored,...Well, we know what your favorite color is, don't we?  Even your <i>hair</i> is purple...
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,Purple hair, purple outfit...even on Mejare, purple hair is a bit outlandish.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,I have some crewmates who wish their hair was a more exotic color, like your purple.  I suppose I should consider my blue strange...
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is that purple hair your natural color?  Where are you from?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=confused,Let's make sure I understand this.  You go to a whole <i>school</i> of people with powers like yours?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2,marker:dropout=thinking,I actually dropped out of school as a girl...perhaps if that school was full of women with superpowers, I might have stayed.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I'm very curious about this "Academy" of yours.  And every student has powers like you do?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=thinking,School was never a pleasant experience for me...but then, I didn't have superpowers.  What's this Academy of yours like, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a lawyer.  I'm assuming that means you work with the law?  Mejare's laws are absolute.
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,You "practice law," correct?  Where I come from, laws are handed down...and no one can argue them.
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,What does a lawyer do, exactly?  Mejare doesn't allow women to argue the laws...if we could, men might be considered human.
2-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare doesn't allow legal arguments...and being a pirate, I'm on the wrong side of them.  But law is what you work with, correct?
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that...
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She's blind without her glasses, too...no mystery there.  But you solve those, yes?
2-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Are you any good with machines?  Or purely a mystery-solver?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,<i>Now</i> are you done?  Or are you going to summon vines and perpetuate this?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Stripping your flowers now?  Any more vegetation we should know about?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Is a bush next?  Are you stripping flowers and replacing them with branches?
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Was that skill, or just a lucky streak?
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=calm,Do have it in you for another streak like that?
2-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,More runs like that, and you'll blow us all away.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly full of energy.  Might even rival Dita, though I could never picture her playing this.
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Wherever this <i>Australia</i> planet is, its food must be nutritious.  You're energetic.
2-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=pleased,You're pretty energetic.  That's good to see in a pilot, and I suppose Dita proves discipline isn't a necessity.
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm a pirate, too...small universe we live in.
2-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  Well...the outfit is certainly different, and apparently the manner.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Don't get complacent just because I'm out of my armor, Jura.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Don't lose your focus, now.  You've been beating me so far...
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased,Can't you maintain a lead over your Leader, Jura?  I've always hoped you'd manage that one day.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Try not to choke this away like you always do.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,You got to school with <i>men</i>?  Can't even imagine...
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,These "vampires" of yours sound like if the Harvest were even more supernatural than it already is.  Fearsome.
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,You work with computers?  I think Parfet's dabbled with them, though she likes machinery better.  Do they help with vampires?
2-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Tell me more about these "vampires."  If they exist, I'm sure Earth will send them our way soon enough.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
2-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,So you do unsavory work for this old woman you know?  I work for an old woman, too...she approached <i>me</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
2-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you're the type who clings to the past, ~player~.  That isn't healthy.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you aware there's a superior Velma character now, ~player~?  Don't cling to nostalgia like a fool.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and inform you there's a better Velma available for play now, ~player~.  This is Velma Classic.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=bored,Still using the inferior characters of the past, just because they're comfortable...listen, ~player~, the game has evolved.  So should you.
2-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Velma Classic is just here for posterity, ~player~.  The Velma of today is far more on-model.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...pure black is an interesting choice, if it's intentional.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...I don't think I know anyone with pure black hair.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  That black hair is imposing...as is your stark outfit.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though no pilot of mine has pure black hair.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=interested,...You still have your jewelry.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Knowing you, your choker's next.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,There's no way you wouldn't drag out the tease as long as possible.  Your jewelry's next.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,I'd recommend the choker, just so you can breathe better.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,That would have been my guess, but since you're calling it into question, probably not.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,I don't see anything else small, but I know who I'm talking to.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=unimpressed,I wouldn't put it past you to be hiding another accessory in your cleavage.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored,I sure <i>hope</i> it's the dress.  That way you could stop pestering me about it.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
2-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=impressed,These "Evas" I've heard of actually seem like impressive technology.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You said something about "Evas" before?  My Dread sounds a lot more reliable...but still, they sound fearsome.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Evas" sound like they're not to be trifled with.  Good thing the Earth I know doesn't have any.
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
2-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
2-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...now we have a <i>goddess</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...feeling alright, Orendi?
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,We've never run into aliens in our travels...didn't think I'd meet one <i>here</i>.  And you're certainly alien.
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...<i>aware</i> of the rest of us?
2-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=bored,...Would you please stop shouting?  Whatever you are...
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=confused,"Dark Magician Girl"?  That's some sort of <i>title</i>, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't you have some sort of first name?  "Dark Magician Girl" is too long to say in the heat of battle.
2-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Dark Magician <i>Girl</i>?  Children aren't allowed here.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.  Though it seems your world has more nature...
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.  Seems you live in a world with vegetation...
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,You...what <i>are</i> you?  Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.  What <i>are</i> you, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...I hope you don't think the floating and lack of eyes is normal to us.  Or maybe it <i>is</i> on Earth...
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.  Although it would seem your outfit is branching out.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=calm,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...say, you look a little different than before.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And is it just me, or did you dress up for this?
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides the outfits.
2-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about your outfit seems unusual for you...strange, since I've never met you before.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'm told you hold some authority in a military organization.  I hope you're using that responsibly.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,A military woman?  Excuse me for not being impressed.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You don't seem quite as fiercely repulsive as the woman soldiers I've come to know.
2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,Military...nothing worse than having a soldier around.  Try not to kill anyone.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,I left Barnette in charge.  I figured she's actually responsible enough to handle it...unlike you.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased,Barnette.  Perhaps you should consult her for leadership advice tonight instead of sex.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,Well, <i>Dita</i> certainly couldn't handle it, so I opted for your darling Barnette.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Barnette's been responsible lately, so I chose her.  Perhaps I need a <i>new</i> second-in-command...
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm told you're into art.  If you want that life-sized portrait, Jura, here's your chance.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is it true you're a "princess"?  I'm told you hold some authority...which makes me question why you're here.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,I'm told you're a ruler of some sort...shouldn't you be <i>ruling</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,I hear you're an authority figure where you're from.  I'm sure your subjects appreciate you spending your time like this.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,My experience with authority has always been that they don't deserve their power...you being here reinforces that.
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...and you don't seem happy to be here.
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that...since you seem annoyed regardless.
2-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here...and you seem miserable about it, anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work as a <i>model</i>?  You and Jura here should talk.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Isn't that you've always wanted, Jura?
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Seems Earth women are capable of being vain, too, Jura...and models.  Have fun with this girl.
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
2-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's this about wrestling?  ...Sounds like a male pursuit.  Physical posturing...
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
2-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=unimpressed,Taking another inch off of the stems?  Surely you can think of another way to waste our time.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,In case you were wondering, that's twice that you should've lost now.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=annoyed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=addressing,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=interested,The whole suit, then?  I don't plan on being pushed that far, but my heart goes out to you.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,Seems your suit is next, Ochako.  I understand how you must be feeling, as you can see.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,Best not to drag this out, Ochako...not if your suit is next.  I understand the awkwardness.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,My fullest sympathies, Ochako.  It can be hard zipping the whole thing off in public.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,They said you're a student...but something about you seems intense.  Like you know more than you let on...
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a student.  The uniform matches...but something in your eyes doesn't.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I know this is rude, but...something seems off about you.  What did you say you did?  You're a student?
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,For a supposed student, there's something about the way you carry yourself that makes me wary...like you're one step ahead of us.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you report the news?  Mejare's news agencies are all state propaganda.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,I'm not a fan of the media...my family has had some bad publicity on Mejare.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're <i>reporting</i> this?  The last time I appeared on television, I was a little girl...
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I appeared on Mejarian television not too far back.  We were raiding an armory.
2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see a woman who shares my fashion sense...though it looks like a tight fit.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Congratulations, ~player~.  You've found what are probably my rarest lines.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  You must really like me, ~player~.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  Honestly, ~player~, that's a little flattering.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=pleased,I see Earth has also perfected cloning technology.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Glad you appreciate me enough to play with more than one of me.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  That's...a little cute, ~player~.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,More than one of me?  Considering my responsibilities, that would really help.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,Would you look at that, ~player~'s figured out the offline version.  And apparently is very fond of me.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,More than one Meia?  How flattering.  Be sure to try out Jura, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Never thought I'd say <i>these</i> lines.  I'm glad you like me so much, ~player~.  That's sweet.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.

2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,What a disgusting woman, offering so bluntly...wait, <i>you're letting her</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Unbelievable that someone could be so lecherous...wait, <i>what</i>?  Don't let her touch you!
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Wha--Jura, you don't even know this woman!  Don't let her near you!  Doesn't this place have rules about that?
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,You look like you're in great shape.  I respect that in a woman...very much.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Not to be too forward, but...your legs are so muscular.  What's your training routine?
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Wow...whatever you do to exercise, I'd like to learn it.  You look fantastic.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman, and in a good way.  Could I get your frame with enough training?
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Your build is impressive...and I wouldn't say to that to <i>any</i> strange woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
2-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,You just want attention...
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,I wanted a challenge, and I get <i>you</i>.

2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You seem like you're getting nervous.  Is something wrong, Ochako?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,...Ochako, you're blushing.  A lot.  What's the matter?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=confused,...Aren't you just taking your belt off?  What's the matter?  You're beet red.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You're blushing, Ochako...and sweating, too.  Is something wrong?  Do you need help?
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too?  Until recently we never got far past the Mejarian system.
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,It took an accidental wormhole to actually fling us out of the Mejarian system.  <i>Your</i> Earth is a lot more adventurous.
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Everyone on Earth, exploring space in peace and harmony?  This Star Fleet sounds nice.  Tarak and Mejare can't even unite the sexes.
2-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll agree that traveling through space teaches you a lot about other civilizations.  The colonies we've run into have all been different.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
2-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off.  What <i>planet</i> are you from?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,That's an...interesting skin color.  And speech pattern.  Who <i>are</i> you, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You were trapped...in a computer?  I guess we were trapped in the Paksis once...
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live in a...muh-more-puh-guh?
2-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is this "muh-more-puh-guh" how Earthlings pass the time?  You should be working.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...You can't be serious.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...<i>Excuse me</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...Can't you take this seriously?  Can't you <i>pretend</i> to do so?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,I--who are you?  How'd you get in here?
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why is your skin pink?  Do you have a medical condition?  Earth is no stranger to poisoning populations it doesn't care for...
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...and you look a little sickly with that skin.  Were you poisoned?  Did Earth do this to you?
2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you alright?  Your skin...it's pink, and it looks unhealthy.  I wouldn't put it past Earth to do this to undesirables...
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,...What in Ma's name am I looking at?  Are you <i>human</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I'll be perfectly honest.  You look inhuman.
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,Er...what <i>are</i> you, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I thought the <i>Harvest</i> was terrifying.  My God.
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Can't believe I've lost twice before this...
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...how embarrassing.
2-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I had a <i>high card</i>.  What a hollow victory...
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So, you're...some sort of "princess"?  Not sure I know what that is...
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So...does "princess" mean "light dresser"?  That would make more than a few of my crewmates princesses.
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,...Could you explain what a "princess" is?  I'm...not from Earth, so I don't know its titles.
2-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is a "princess" a position of power on Earth?  You'd think an authority figure would wear more clothing...
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I just don't understand.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,You can't run away from your problems, Florina...I've tried.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,I appreciate women that stand their ground against their fears...
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,Running away doesn't solve anything...your fears can always run faster.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Good to see another woman who shares my fashion sense.  Even the color scheme is close...
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,My bodysuit is pretty standard among Mejarian styles...but looking at you, maybe it was inspired by Earth.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Bodysuits are comfortable, aren't they?  And efficient, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,That bodysuit of yours looks awfully similar to my own.  I don't think I could pull off that helmet, though.
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
2-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
2-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Are you...feeling OK?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You...<i>want</i> to strip?
2-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,I...who <i>are</i> you?
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you feast on men's energy, or something to that effect?  Way to confirm what Tarakkians already think.
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shapely.  Is that how a "succubus" lures men into her traps?
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=confused,Is all that really necessary?  And are those real wings?  I heard you say you were a <i>succubus</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=bored,You might actually give Jura some competition with that figure.  She's hunting for men herself...
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,You said you were a "Street Fighter," correct?  I suppose that <i>would</i> get you into shape.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,You said something about street fighting?  I've been in street fights.  I'd rather not go back to that, but if you like it...
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You said you're a street fighter?  That's a harsh life...I lived on the streets when I was younger.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,Street fighting isn't the kind of thing I'd glorify, but if it makes you happy...just take care of yourself.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type...though a rather unintimidating one.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  You <i>claim</i> to protect, but only when it suits you.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=bored,Oh, perfect.  A soldier.  Try not to kill anyone for fun before the game is over.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The ones I know enjoy indoctrinating children and shutting down housing districts.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outfit that attracts men?  You'll have an easy time finding a man, then, Jura.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Talk to Jura about it...
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,I can't let my second-in-command get <i>that</i> far ahead of me.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,I hope you didn't think you'd just sweep me, Jura.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,You finally lost.  As usual, I expect your composure to fall apart now.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,Finally got a read on you.  Shame it took me this long.
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
2-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Jura.  Always bragging about her looks...although she might be more justified in doing so.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,At least your <i>hair</i> is expressive.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
2-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=thinking,Time travel...if it's true, I'm curious what you've actually used it for.  Unless you'd rather hide that...
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  You look like you're about to cast off that dress and go running.
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You seem more like a dressed-up athlete.
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She's certainly not as athletic as <i>you</i> look.
2-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though you might have an athletic edge on me.
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
2-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,This is how Jura treats <i>everyone</i>.  She's quite proud of herself...and to be fair, no disasters have struck because of her.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,I'll start reprimanding Jura when she starts getting women killed.  For now it's just an annoyance.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,I'm the squadron leader, yes, but Jura's second-in-command.  Besides, she hasn't gotten anyone killed yet...
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Jura's second-in-command.  She usually does her job...she just tends to get distracted with <i>this</i> sort of thing during downtime.
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,Someone said you gave up on school.  So did I...
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like you get a lot of exercise.  Always good to see in a woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=disappointed,You said something about a <i>killer</i>?  Earth's no stranger to killing, as far as I'm concerned.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
2-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...

2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it.

2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.

2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.

2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,Are you a student...?  I went to state schools on Mejare when I was a little girl...
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,Are you a student...?  How do men behave in school, anyway?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,Are you a student?  I dropped out of school...
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,What's that phrase you keep saying?  "Plus Ultra"?  What does that mean?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,Why do you keep saying "Plus Ultra"?  Is that some sort of battle cry?
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=calm,...What's the meaning of that "Plus Ultra" phrase you keep repeating?  Is it for teambuilding or just personal confidence?
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
2-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Earth was devastated many years ago, so it started using its colonies as organ farms.  Mejare is the uterus colony...so there's no men.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=thinking,We've come to know a few men, actually...but Earth's organ-harvesting is why Mejare is nothing but women.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Mejare is just one of Earth's many colonies.  It was intentionally settled as women-only for Earth to harvest reproductive organs.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,Jura wanted to come here <i>because</i> we don't know much about men.  Earth harvests uteri from Mejare, so there's no need for them.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Sorry to be insulting, but you look rather unevenly-proportioned.  You should exercise more.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look you're giving everyone?  This is just a game.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,I'm trying not to comment on your body...Mejarians tend to be judgmental enough.
2-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you seems off.  I'd suggest you relax.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.
2-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,"Black Canary"?  I <i>wish</i> Mejare had canaries...
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we won't be here long.
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=confused,Are you counting each bandage as one layer?  If not, this'll be over soon.
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really wasn't counting on seeing nudity this quickly.  At least it's a woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Did I just walk in on a game that's nearly over?
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
2-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Wha--<i>don't bring up Misty</i>!  It's not like she'll understand.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,You--I--Misty and I are not an <i>item</i>.  I just give her advice.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You know perfectly well Misty's into <i>men</i>, Jura...and also that she's too young.
2-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Why do you try to twist my relationship with Misty into love?  She just...needs guidance.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I was told you were a spacefarer, as well...and a pilot.  Good to see a woman who understands my situation.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Is it true you're a space pilot?  So am I...I'd love to discuss formations or maneuvers after the game is over.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're a pilot.  I never expected to meet a woman like that here...what's your ship like?
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I heard you're a space pilot.  I command a Dread squadron myself...what is it that you do?
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone told me you're a space pilot.  I've really fallen in love with piloting myself, though I only have a few years' experience...
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a..."princess"?  For nobility, you don't seem too informed...
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Then why are you here?
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She'd never lower herself to games like this...
2-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though I suppose you're lowering yourself by playing this.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,What are you waving that thing around for?  Guns aren't children's playthings!
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,Put the gun down, would you?  What are you so afraid of?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...An acerbic, bestial woman waving a racketous mechanical gun around.  Just how I pictured Earth women.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,I can understand wanting to be armed in a seedy place like this, but you're taking this too far.  And don't wave it around!
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,It's good to see a fellow pilot!  You even look a little like Belvedere.
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,<i>Focus</i>, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,You'll burn out if you keep playing like this.
2-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Surely you don't want to go out like this.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...look, Jura, another one.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You're a fiery one...she's how I picture your and Barnette's daughters, Jura.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of Jura here.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  Duero seems that way, too, even if he only shows it to Parfet.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Take that how you will.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Besides Duero, I can't picture a man sitting still.
2-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=thinking,You're into art, you said?  Artists are good to have around...they tend not to kill people.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Hunting space pirates?  Some pirates have a good reason for what they do...
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...And you hunt <i>space pirates</i>.  I see.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you travel through space, too...and hunt space pirates.  Good luck with that.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,There's a pirate named Rabat I wouldn't mind you catching for us...since you travel through space.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...and origin.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree, Samus?  Even out in space...
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and you <i>hunt space pirates</i>?  I'll keep that in mind.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, take instructions from this woman so you can actually put that rapier to use.
2-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches <i>yours</i>, Jura.  Can't say the arm does, though.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You're a fiery one.  How'd you lose your arm?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,What do you think, Jura?  Should we have our arms replaced with robotics?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=calm,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type, based on those weapons.  Guess you can't trust a soldier to leave them behind, even here.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got a sweet expression for all those weapons you're carrying.  It's unsettling.
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you brought weapons here?  What kind of place is this?
2-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You're a military woman?  You've got the uncomfortably sweet expression of one, for sure.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=confused,Are...you OK?  You're all clammed up...
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like a schoolgirl.  Are you sure you want to be here?  Is someone making you do this?
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you alright...Saki, was it?  You look so nervous...
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Saki?  That's you, right?  You've hardly said a thing...and you're turning red.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've seen better days...and are about to see worse ones.  Are you sure you want to play this?
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=impressed,You go to school for "magic"?  That...sounds rather fascinating, actually.
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun...but I suppose magic would have made it easier.
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't have good memories of school...maybe you could talk about your magic instead?
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm told you can use magic.  Sometimes the Paksis feels that way...we certainly never had any schooling on the subject.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...I thought <i>Marinette</i> was Ladybug.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,...So what you're saying is, Marinette made her public debut before Samus?
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  Sounds old...Marinette doesn't look old, especially not older than Samus.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus and Marinette like this?  I'm totally lost...
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford that, if you wanted.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,Haven't you played cards before?  Aren't you wealthy enough to own a <i>casino</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though you've probably got more money than my whole crew.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  Even if it's only on finances.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little on edge.  It's just a card game.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's an interesting streak in your hair.  Mejarians have unusual hair colors, but not on specific parts...the red matches your attitude.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm told you spend a lot of time fighting woman authority figures.  Guess we're not so different...even if your demeanor is a bit acerbic.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That red streak seems to betray your attitude.  Just try to relax...
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,What...does that have to with anything?
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,...I don't even know what Street Fighter <i>1</i> is.
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=confused,There's an <i>industry</i> for these...<i>things</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,I don't know what it was before, so I don't think <i>revolutionizing</i> it would mean much to me...
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that headband some sort of designation?  Not to be rude.
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a "ninja"?  Sounds like the telepathic people Hibiki was stuck with.
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=bored,You're awfully quiet.  Not that I take issue with that...
2-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=confused,So these "ninjas" have their own society?  What separates you from a typical human?
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's, and your sword like Jura's here.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.  But the sword is distinctly Jura.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, learn from this woman and actually use your sword properly.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,As long as you've got that sword, could you teach Jura how to use it?  That rapier of hers is just for show.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=confused,...<i>Protagonist</i>?  You're talking like she's fictional.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=bored,<i>What</i> are you going on about?  <i>Gaming</i>?  <i>Protagonists</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  A year?  By what measure?  What are you talking about?
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus like this?  She's standing right here.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,Do you have someone to support you?  This switching can't be good for your mental health...or physical.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=calm,Your blonde version seems liable to get you killed.  Do you have friends?  Colleagues?  Are you alright?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,I'd hate to see you wander around with your...condition.  Are you sure you're safe, always switching as you do?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=thinking,Earth women are full of surprises...do you want to live on the Nirvana, just to have some support?
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough...but magic sounds like a good motivator.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...but not about <i>magic</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...on most days.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=calm,Bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?  I hear you normally wear one.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.  But he always dresses the same, unlike you.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it...is this how people dress there?
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating...even though you're not dressed for the part today.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Let me guess.  You're going to take off your underwear.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,I'm expecting a mundane display.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Here we go again...
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,Good, you're wearing enough makeup for both of us.  Saves me the trouble.
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...Of <i>space</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Who in space makes these decisions?
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I thought you were just out in space...
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too...how's it treating you?
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  Even with a whole crew at your side...
2-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=impressed,You fly through space on an <i>observatory</i>?  Sounds...strangely luxurious.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=pleased,That you find it within yourself to tease even now is honestly sort of remarkable.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=bored,Oh, just get it over with.  This is ridiculous.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=disappointed,Your thong.  There, I humored you.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Stop wasting time and do it already.  Shame you seem to have given up on the game.
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Bless you--oh, <i>no</i>.  Don't tell me...
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Not <i>this</i> again.  The blonde version?
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,God bless you--oh, damn it.  She's changed back...
2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Bless--damn it, that was Launch.  Here we go again...
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't antagonize her, Jura.  I can respect a woman who understands the value of silence.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You could do to learn from me or her when it comes to occasionally being quiet.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You can't learn anything from talking, Jura.  Kyoko's being smart, listening in on us...
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,She <i>does</i> have my temperament.  Don't take that as an insult, Kyoko...more women should listen to others.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.  And she doesn't really have the wardrobe for this game...
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, you're...a "clown"?  You shouldn't put yourself down like that...unless it's some kind of profession?
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly does a "clown" do for a living?  Are you some kind of public entertainer?
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, clowns...entertain people?  All the entertainment on Mejare tends to focus on the evils of men.
2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard you were a "clown," which sounds a little degrading.  You don't seem too broken up about it, though.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
2-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  Rabat probably considers himself one.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  I can appreciate getting the job done quickly.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=bored,An assassin...there's nothing subtle about our Dreads, unfortunately.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,As assassin, you said?  One of the reasons I prefer Mejarian laser rigns is their subtlety.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,A "goddess"?  I'm sorry if I ever called you vain, Jura.  This is a new one.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You have some competition for extravagant dress, Jura.  And vanity, apparently.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Mejare has detectives...but they mostly investigate enemies of the state.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Anyone who focuses on discovering secrets is probably hiding a few themselves.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  Are men any good in school?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  More nuanced than Mejare's, I hope.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem about as expressive as <i>I</i> ever get.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...who's the Oma going to be?
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=impressed,Someone said you're with a woman...have the two of you gotten pregnant yet?
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I guess.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
2-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=awkward,Australians sure have a unique...manner of speaking.
2-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=disappointed,...How exactly did this "Australia" develop its dialect?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Oh, good, another Meia.  Now I can take a day off of bossing Jura around.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Look at that, Jura.  The worst day of your life.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Playing with more than one of me is sweet.  Have you extended the same love to Jura here?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,I'm glad you like me enough to play with more than one of me, ~player~.  Do you like Jura, too?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I feel your pain.  I command a short, overconfident man myself.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,Well, this is <i>one</i> way to grow closer to your colleagues.  I sure wouldn't want any crewmates here.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Surely a <i>goddess</i> wouldn't need a man to help her.
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.  And you don't really have the wardrobe for this game...
2-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  Quite decorated, as well.  Some type of authority, then?
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You're certainly dressed for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I have to ask...I don't know Earth's power structure.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...even if they dress that way.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>Royalty</i>?  If you're the one ruling Earth, I suggest you stop sending the Harvest our way.
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Amarone.
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Valore.
2-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,"Pearl"?  Jura's already a big fan of yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,What was that transformation you did earlier?  That was impressive...you had a full suit on!
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Didn't you come here with a pink suit on?  How'd you take it off so quickly?  All I saw was light...
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,Did you...<i>transform</i> earlier?  What was that all about?  I'm curious...
2-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Weren't you wearing a suit like mine just before?  ...Besides the pink.  How did you transform out of it?
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...though you look like you're in a hurry to remove it.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=bored,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...but you seem quite comfortable yourself.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you're having fun already, even despite that strange green skin.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=bored,I was about to ask about your green skin, but it just seems to be your natural complexion.  You're certainly having fun as we speak.
2-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you smirking about all the time?  Just comfortable in your own...<i>green</i> skin?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.  What do you use this magic for?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?  I'd like to see some...
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset...in battle and out.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=addressing,If you could teach your "magic" to me, this night might actually be worth it.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like Paiway dressed up as a fairy.  Are you old enough to be here?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I read about fairies as a girl.  They protected Mejarian children from marauding packs of men.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,A <i>fairy</i>?  Earth never fails to surprise me with its species variety.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a fairy?  I'd need to see something spectacular for you to match the stories I've heard.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> chilly, Jura.  At least I show my face.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Clearly I need to show less emotion, then.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You're right.  I could really improve my stoicism by watching her.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A <i>concession</i>?  I thought you were going to tease me all night.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I'm sure she has her reasons.  Stoicism is important for a leader...
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,...I'm sorry, you said you were a <i>genie</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly is a "genie"?
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Is "genie" some kind of Earth race?
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Amarone never calls herself a genie...
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Valore never called herself a genie...
2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  B.C. never calls herself a genie...but then, she doesn't exactly count.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...but the mechanical arm is more striking.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a fiery one.  I'm sorry about your arm...or I <i>would</i> be, if it didn't look superior to my own.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=addressing,I shouldn't pry as to how you lost your arm...but is that mechanical replacement useful?
2-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,You're a fiery one.  Like if Barnette and Jura had their child...hopefully she'd have her arm.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I don't think people will be confused.  This woman seems a lot more well-known on this planet.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,One letter can make all the difference...just like one mistake.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,If you actually got us confused, I'd have Duero check your eyes before you posed a danger to the team.
2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I trust my second-in-command to track the subtle differences between Mei and I.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm not sure I'd want to date someone who'd agree to it in a seedy place like this.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Unless she's heading to Mejare soon, I can't see that relationship working out.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You seem far more interested, Jura.  She <i>is</i> blonde, after all.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe <i>you</i> could flirt with her and bring her back.  Barnette could use some target practice.
2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe if she agreed to join the crew...but what from I hear, she <i>hunts</i> pirates.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  ...Apparently not with a "Borg collective."  I apologize.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...What's this "Borg" all about?
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Borg" sounds a lot like the Harvest...taking whatever they want.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,We used to think men were just a collective, too...maybe I shouldn't make fun.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Star Fleet" sounds nice.  Humans are all scattered on different planets where I'm from...though we don't have to deal with this "Borg."
2-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and the "Borg" sounds suspiciously similar to the Harvest.  We'll watch out for them.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,That's quite the outfit.  You may have competition, Jura...but then, you like that.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Someone else with blue hair...too bad you're a soldier.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I suppose.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I can see two reasons why you and Jura are going to get along this evening.  And your martial arts skills aren't one of them.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,You raid tombs?  All of Earth is ancient history is Mejare, not just dead queens.
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you certainly look fit, which is good to see in a woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,<i>Tombs</i>, you said?  Not for me...too cramped.
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is it true you're a "mutant"?  Forgive my ignorance, but you look quite human to me.
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=awkward,For a supposed mutant, you look very human.  Maybe it's an Earth custom I'm missing...
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,I was told you're a mutant.  Considering your very human appearance, I think that warrants an explanation.
2-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,Would you mind explaining what they meant when they said you're a "mutant"?  Is that just a term for some subset of Earthlings?
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  Might even make <i>Jura</i> jealous.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
2-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=bored,...About as much on as <i>Barnette</i> ever layers.  And she has a certain reputation for baring it all.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Assuming that style exists anywhere, it's too conspicuous.  This coloration blends into machinery.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,She can be as bubbly as she wants.  I doubt she has the responsibilities you or I carry.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,She looks young, Jura...and in a better position.  She can afford to be happy, so let her.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wherever she comes from, I'm sure that pattern is optimal.  She must wear it for a reason.
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
2-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...With <i>magic</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  I guess <i>magic</i> would make you worthy of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=thinking,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  Well, she can't use <i>magic</i>...
2-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...but magic might give you a good reason to think that.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=interested,<i>Two</i> Juras?  Well, you've certainly dolled yourself up to earn this.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=bored,I guess all that teasing really did the trick, Jura.  ~player~ loves you enough to put another one.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=unimpressed,Good.  Twice the vanity, half the responsibility.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=thinking,I don't make any effort to look beautiful, so I see why ~player~ would want two of you instead...
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...at least the rest seems comfrotable for you.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.  The rest of our styles match, at least.
2-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_spiders=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a student, yes?  And what does this Academy you attend teach you about?
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,My school experiences...weren't the best.  But I'm curious what you've been learning in this Academy of yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shy...that's normally what I expect from students.  What is it you've been taught, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A student?  I dropped out of school...I had to learn piloting the hard way.  What's taught in "Beacon Academy"?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,...You've never played poker before?  What do Earth women do during downtime?
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=impressed,You've never played poker before?  Gascogne would have a field day with you...
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,You've never played poker before, and you start with <i>strip</i> poker?
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons...or another dress, at least.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...our outfits tend to vary, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...you've got some strange outfits yourselves.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides those bizarre outfits.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And dress herself in different ways.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Did you get dressed up for this?  I know a few Mejarians that are obsessed with fashion...
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=confused,You're...<i>streaming</i> this?  I don't understand.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you talking to?
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  Whatever, no one knows who I am anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  They might recognize me on Mejare, but not Earth...
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Guess I'm getting a <i>Wanted</i> mugshot tonight.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't like publicity...not one bit.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're aware you need <i>clothing</i> to play this game, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=confused,Did you just come here from a finished game?  You've got almost nothing on...
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=impressed,And they say <i>Mejarians</i> dress revealingly.  You barely dress at <i>all</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you meant to come dressed in a cat costume, it seems to be missing a few pieces.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Men aren't all that dangerous.  Just simpletons.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Surely you've grown up around men.  I don't have <i>that</i> benefit.
2-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=impressed,I never thought an Earth woman would be so shy around men...
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're tall for a woman.  Might give Gascogne a run for her money.
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's this "America" planet known for?  Tall women?
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You report the news?  I was on the news as a little girl...wish I wasn't.
2-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're a reporter?  It's been a while since I had a <i>positive</i> media appearance.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=pleased,Barnette's got green hair, too...but that's with the help of Mejarian genetic engineering.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=calm,Green hair isn't that strange on Mejare.  One of my pilots has it.  What about Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=impressed,Is your hair naturally green?  That'd be impressive for an Earth woman...
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  What do you think, Jura?  Was it for owning an anatomy book?
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...like us.
2-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman.  I'm not sure if <i>Gascogne</i> could measure up to you...
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,Earth women can get pretty tall, it seems...but so can Mejarians, and I believe the gravity's the same.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think Gascogne's still got an inch on you, so don't feel self-conscious about your size.
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=awkward,Do men like tall women?  I'm about middle-of-the-pack in that regard...
2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,You carry yourself well for your height, though you seem a little uneasy.  Do you not get out much?
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,I'm told you were cryogenically frozen for some time...that's also true of Misty, a young girl I know from Pluto.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,Is it true you were in cryosleep for a number of years?  So was a man I know...he looks younger than me, but he's over a hundred years old.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,Someone mentioned you were in cryosleep for some time.  It sounds uncomfortable...maybe you don't want to talk about it.
2-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,You were cryogenically frozen, correct?  Several of my crewmates were, as well...technically making them older than any of us.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Interesting skin color.  Are you even human?  Or an Earthling?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare has strange hair colors...apparently Earth has strange <i>skin</i> colors.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confused,I'm not sure what's more distracting: the skin color, or the wings.  Are you from Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really thought this was Planet Earth.  I wasn't aware people here could be so...colorful.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Wha--<i>what are you doing</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't wave that thing around!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't fire that thing!
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,<i>Where's your trigger discipline</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Why did you <i>bring</i> that thing?
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,Out of everyone here, you seem remarkably...normal.  In a way, that's refreshing.
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,As far as I can tell, you're quite standard for Earth women.  Don't take that as an insult...
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Hm.  Not sure what to make of you.  You seem rather straightforward.
2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=bored,As normal as can be...which is why I'm wary.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,You're doing it <i>again</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You said you come from the plains?  Sounds nice...Mejare's not very verdant, and Tarak's even worse.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You come from the plains, you said?  My parents took me to the plains when I was a little girl...it was fun to run around.
2-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,The plains, you said you lived in?  Somehow I doubt the Earth I know has any green left...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
2-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,This "magic" of yours sounds pretty interesting.  Can it be taught?
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're immortal.  Is that in the sense of never aging, or never dying at all?
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,If you really <i>can</i> wield magic, I'd be honored to learn it...it sounds useful.
2-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=calm,The Paksis has proven to me that powers beyond human ability exist...so I'm willing to believe you might have some.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So does Jura here.  Fire away.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  This is your chance, Jura.  Make connections.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=confused,You're...a little thin on clothes to be playing this, don't you think?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  You've barely got anything on.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've heard of Valentine's Day...but that's for love, not indecency.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=bored,Shouldn't you have come to a strip poker game...<i>clothed</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=pleased,That's about how much Barnette wears with her apron.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=impressed,Even for an Earth woman, that looks like pretty old-fashioned dress.  Your manners are similarly classical...
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,I could have sworn I saw you at another table than this one...guess it must have been a similarly passive woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=confused,How'd you lose that bit of your finger?  You seem rather demure to be in combat...
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem very assertive.  I wouldn't think this game would attract a shy woman like you...
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,Videl...you keep mentioning your "dad."  What's a dad?
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...what's a father?
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  With a brooch and everything...you look the part.
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  The crown leads me in that direction...
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  That's who rules Mejare...
2-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...the title doesn't make the woman.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that a camera?  Paiway, our child nurse, is always skulking around with hers...so this is nothing new.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=bored,A camera?  Are you really going to photograph us all?  ...Whatever.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you trying to blackmail us with that camera?  I've been in the media for far worse than this.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hope you don't think you're going to embarrass me with that camera.  I'm not exactly from here, anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,Jura's no fighter, but something tells me you and she would get along.  Two things, actually.
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
2-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,Not to be rude, but I still can't comprehend this.  Are you shaving...<i>the rest of it</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,...Is the bottom fur next?  Did you really come here naked?
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,To meet a cat-woman hybrid here, and that she's not even wearing anything...I assume what's around your groin is fur, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,You've only lost once before, but I think I know what's coming next.  If it, too, is fur...
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches Jura's.  So does your intensity.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,You're a fiery one...like if Barnette and Jura had their child, finally.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of some of my crewmates.
2-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager...and your dress doesn't seem too protective.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...are Earth women realy like this?
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=bored,You seem to know us all pretty well...perhaps a little <i>too</i> well, if you follow.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,The same person, both male and female...that shreds any doubts I had about men and women being the same species.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,I wonder what Hibiki would look like as a woman...probably taller, honestly.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Tarakkian scientists.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,The same person, one born on Mejare and the other on Tarak.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women, and I'm not sure which one is prettier.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
2-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,See what too much makeup leads to, Jura?  You shouldn't concern yourself with it.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,So, tell me about these "Phantom Thieves."  What is it you do?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Phantom Thieves" of yours sound like pirates.  What do you steal, exactly?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,Parfet is into computers.  You said you were, too, right?  Something about "Phantom Thieves"?
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?  Especially with men's mechanical sidearms?
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot quieter than those racketous male ones.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.  She likes men's mechanical guns.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought those clunky men's guns to a card game.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...Is there a reason you keep waving those clunky kinetic guns around?  Women should know better than to use male weapons.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...You don't need to start any fights.  I certainly don't want to hear the racket of those men's sidearms you've got.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,I'll never understand Barnette's fixation on clunky men's guns...or yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?  ...Or without a body?

2-female_must_strip,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_mush,priority:381,marker:chi_mush=awkward,...Do you two know each other, Chiaki?  Is this woman famous?
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outift that attracts men?  If so, Jura will have an easy time finding one.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Jura certainly does, but I've never seen eye-to-eye with her.
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're some kind of hunter, correct?  I suppose a pirate isn't far off from that.
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's this planet <i>Pandora</i> like?  More verdant than Mejare, I hope.
2-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  I think I knew a woman named Pandora once...
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,People say I never smile...are you the same way?
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue...I'm sure Parfet would like working with you, if you do engineering.
2-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=disappointed,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off...once she learns to pronounce "San Fransokyo."
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
2-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing...but just as unkempt.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She wears glasses, too...and she sometimes neglects hygiene.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together...and didn't teach her how to clean herself.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build..and Parfet's glasses.  Are you old enough to be here?  You should have cleaned yourself, regardless.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds...Parfet gets like that, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What are those sounds you keep making?  Is that the language of...whatever planet you come from?
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,I can barely understand you...verbally <i>and</i> physically.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's with your speech?  You keep making these odd sounds in places...

2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy enough to vary your attire?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.  As well as letting you change outfits.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford a wardrobe change, too.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,I should have expected a wealthy woman to change her wardrobe...I would, too, if I owned anything.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,You work in a team of women?  And your outfit is different...we don't really have uniforms, either.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself.  And has the finances to vary her outfit.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak...that's why its soldiers are so ruthless, even to us.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman...but military service <i>isn't</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soldiers...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.
2-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'll try to reserve judgment...but know that it's a rare soldier that earns anything but my contempt.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  That's rare on Mejare...you'd turn heads.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Is that common on Earth?  Few Mejarians are that way...
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Dark skin...besides Valore and Amarone, I'm not sure I know any Mejarian women like you.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=thinking,Most Mejarians are pale, but your skin is dark.  So is Valore's...but that's beside the point.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You don't quite seem dressed for the occasion here.  Unless you'd rather just get it over with.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking,Just like challenging yourself, based on how little you're wearing?  I just rushed over in what I usually wear.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,At least you seem to like the attention.  Based on your outfit, you're going to attract a lot of it.
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You've got enough energy for both of us.  Neither of us is wearing very much, though...
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're some kind of covert agent?  I'd be lying if I said I was good at sniffing those out.
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,Speaking of covert agents...I think we gave B.C. a newfound respect for women.
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,The Nirvana's had its share of covert agents.  They tend to warm up to our cause.
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=impressed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  I suppose the Paksis isn't all that different...
2-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  We've had our issues with hostile red light in the past.
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=disappointed,How could an <i>Earth woman</i> be so shy around men?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=confused,Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around men?  What's the issue?
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=disappointed,If you want to learn about men, talk to Dita.  She's obsessed.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=happy,Did you slip into your native language before?  That's a little cute.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=pleased,Despite our differences, humans throughout the galaxy <i>did</i> agree on a language...
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,Was that a taste of what they speak on planet France?

3-male_human_must_strip=addressing,What are you afraid of, ~player~?
3-male_human_must_strip=addressing,I've heard men are competitive...so you'd better give me some competition.
3-male_human_must_strip=smug,Underestimating your opponent, are we?
3-male_human_must_strip=addressing,Being down to my underwear doesn't faze me.
3-male_human_must_strip=addressing,If you think I'd choke under pressure...think again.
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.

3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=bored,Jura dragging me here at all isn't what I'd call supportive, Rinkah.

3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,...I've seen enough men to know you're not human.
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly...<i>are</i> you?
3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=disappointed,So <i>gay</i> is the term Earthlings use?  Sounds sort of derisive.
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  You look like you can barely get yourself out of bed.
3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Man or woman, unkempt appearances don't impress me.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll be honest.  You don't look like much of a man.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought men were supposed to be tall and strong.  Of course, Hibiki proves <i>that</i> wrong...
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why do you have wings?  I <i>thought</i> men were human, but maybe not.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Children aren't allowed in here, even male ones.
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Maybe I just lack the experience, but...are you a man or a woman?
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Men and women have always looked pretty distinct to me...and then there's you.
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you live underground?  Sounds claustrophobic...
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Maybe you could talk to Jura...if you seemed capable of talking.

3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Unless it's April Fool's Day, you shouldn't be picking this character.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,If this is what Earthlings find attractive, I'm glad the colonists left.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,I'm not sure how to feel about being picked by the same player who'd choose <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,You must really hate me to stick me on a table with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,So, you help that girl fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,You seem immature...but then, Hibiki makes that work for himself.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,They told me you're an agent, but an agent of <i>what</i>, I'm still not sure.  Perhaps you could elaborate...and take off your weapon.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=angry,Don't think I don't see that weapon.  I'm trying to be less wary of men...but an armed "agent" puts me on edge.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's my understanding you're an agent.  Well, I'm a pirate...and I didn't come armed, so perhaps you should remove your weapon.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=bored,An "agent" of a man with a weapon at his hip is making this an uncomfortable experience already.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=disappointed,So you <i>can</i> speak.  What was that all about?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=annoyed,So you <i>were</i> just making fun of me...
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=bored,Grunting and screaming around women is what I'd expect from a Tarakkian.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,What is this "Pod" you keep referring to?  What does it do?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Are you going to explain what your "Pod" is, or are we all supposed to ignore it?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll bite.  What's this "Pod" you keep mentioning?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm curious about this "Pod" of yours.  I suppose you wanted me to ask about that, since you said it out loud.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,Never thought I'd meet a <i>man</i> with my fashion sense.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you were frozen for decades.  Hibiki was that way, too...
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Hibiki could certainly benefit from that...not that he'd ever accept.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Seems unbecoming of a man to take the easy way out.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,If everyone on this <i>America</i> planet is built like you, I'd hate to see the women.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you really a captain?  You seem built more to <i>take</i> orders than give them.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't need to strip for me to tell you're fit.  They'd worship you on Tarak.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard there's a female version of you.  What kept <i>her</i> away?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,And I thought <i>Bart's</i> outfits could be garish.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress more garishly than Bart.  I wonder how <i>you'd</i> look bald.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...That's a man, Jura.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I'm no expert, but I think Corrin is a <i>man</i>, actually.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I think Corrin's a man, Jura.  Though he <i>does</i> look feminine.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,And I thought <i>Hibiki</i> was outgoing...
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,Well...you're certainly enthusiastic.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,We're all right here.  You don't have to shout.
3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is "captain" an actual designation, or just what you call yourself?
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Can't you take this seriously, ~player~?
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,~player~, you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,You put <i>Shaggy Blanco</i> on a table with me?  Do you really hate me that much?
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I wish I could understand what you're saying.  Maybe then I'd get something out of this joke.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,At least you started working out.  You're still all unkempt.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=disappointed,White's not a popular color among Mejarians...you can imagine why.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,Not sure how to take this.  You picked <i>me</i>...but apparently I'm only worthy of playing with Shaggy Blanco.
3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=addressing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to a joke character?  You underestimate me, ~player~.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why are you blindfolded?  Don't you want to see the cards?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you wearing a blindfold?  Are you really that confident?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you on a bet or something?  Take your blindfold off and play seriously.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Your outfit is one thing, but to be wearing a blindfold?  What's wrong with you?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Jura, do you think you could learn from this man?  Perhaps nonverbally?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't seem too talkative, but I'm told you can handle a sword.  You could stand to learn something from this man, Jura.
3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Barely talks, skilled with a sword?  Look at that, Jura.  He's everything you're not.
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=calm,You might be handsomer if you grew your hair out.  Duero makes it work.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Judging by his attitude, men are a lot more shy about nudity...which only makes this more curious.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=awkward,You two must be close, then.  Good to know men and women can be this comfortable around each other...I suppose.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,It's definitely a unique coincidence.  But being nude together is no issue for us...I wonder if that's true for these two.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Jura and I shower together, since the ship only has the communal bathroom...is that true for you two, as well?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,The same person, both male and female...guess that cements it.  Men and women <i>are</i> the same species.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,I wonder what <i>I'd</i> look like as a man...horrifying.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Mejarian scientists.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=pleased,The same person, one born on Tarak and the other on Mejare.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women.
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=impressed,You're...a <i>man</i>?  Not like one I've ever seen.
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you speaking through a translator?  Is that some archaic Earth language?
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Earth languages besides the common tongue are a mystery to me.  Even Tarakkian code is not something I've ever concerned myself with.
3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Facial markings?  Like Rabat's people.  I'll keep that in mind, Earth-man.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=pleased,I never thought I'd meet a man shorter than Hibiki...but you might be the one.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who let this...<i>child</i> in here?
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Men really do come in all shapes and sizes.  You might as well be a woman.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you?  You look like a child.  Get out.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,I'm no expert on men, but you look like a prepubescent one...never mind the cat ears.  Children aren't allowed here.
3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,We shouldn't be playing with this child here.  This is wrong...
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=impressed,Wait, you two work together?  That's...very awkward.  Jura and I split up when we came here...
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,I see even on Earth, the superiority of women is clearly entrenched.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  The captain is quite a bit older than I am...
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  I sure wouldn't want <i>Hibiki</i> playing this with me.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Now</i> are you taking off that ridiculous blindfold?  Or...<i>tactical visor</i>.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,So are you forfeiting, or are you finally deciding to let yourself see?
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Attached to that blindfold?  Either give up the game or take off that thing...your move.
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
3-female_human_must_strip=calm,We all have to do it, ~player~...
3-female_human_must_strip=calm,You'll be fine...deep breaths, mind clear.
3-female_human_must_strip=addressing,I train in this outfit...I'm not feeling embarrassed.
3-female_human_must_strip=disappointed,Stay calm and focus.  The clothes don't matter...the cards do.
3-female_human_must_strip=addressing,You're always your own biggest obstacle...
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,More streaks like that, and I may have to consider you for a pilot spot...
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Did you mean to go so long without losing?
3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=disappointed,You've been almost zenlike...like the people on Anpathos.
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Embarrassing.
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...it still feels like a loss.
3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Losing would have been more satisfying.
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Finishing strong is important, ~player~...
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,You're better than this, ~player~...
3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=thinking,Dita sometimes makes mistakes under pressure, too...
3-female_must_strip=calm,We all have to do it, ~name~...
3-female_must_strip=calm,You'll be fine.  Deep breaths, mind clear.
3-female_must_strip=addressing,I train in this outfit.  I'm not feeling embarrassed.
3-female_must_strip=calm,Stay calm and focus.  The clothes don't matter, the cards do.
3-female_must_strip=addressing,You're always your own biggest obstacle.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...at least the rest seems comfrotable for you.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.  The rest of our styles match, at least.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_spiders=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...on most days.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=calm,Bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?  I hear you normally wear one.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.  But he always dresses the same, unlike you.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it...is this how people dress there?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating...even though you're not dressed for the part today.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,Good, you're wearing enough makeup for both of us.  Saves me the trouble.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,So, tell me about these "Phantom Thieves."  What is it you do?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Phantom Thieves" of yours sound like pirates.  What do you steal, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,Parfet is into computers.  You said you were, too, right?  Something about "Phantom Thieves"?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.  What do you use this magic for?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?  I'd like to see some...
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset...in battle and out.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=addressing,If you could teach your "magic" to me, this night might actually be worth it.
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...Of <i>space</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Who in space makes these decisions?
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I thought you were just out in space...
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too...how's it treating you?
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  Even with a whole crew at your side...
3-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=impressed,You fly through space on an <i>observatory</i>?  Sounds...strangely luxurious.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outift that attracts men?  If so, Jura will have an easy time finding one.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Jura certainly does, but I've never seen eye-to-eye with her.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...our outfits tend to vary, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...you've got some strange outfits yourselves.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides those bizarre outfits.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And dress herself in different ways.
3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Did you get dressed up for this?  I know a few Mejarians that are obsessed with fashion...
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't antagonize her, Jura.  I can respect a woman who understands the value of silence.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You could do to learn from me or her when it comes to occasionally being quiet.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You can't learn anything from talking, Jura.  Kyoko's being smart, listening in on us...
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,She <i>does</i> have my temperament.  Don't take that as an insult, Kyoko...more women should listen to others.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=interested,<i>Two</i> Juras?  Well, you've certainly dolled yourself up to earn this.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=bored,I guess all that teasing really did the trick, Jura.  ~player~ loves you enough to put another one.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=unimpressed,Good.  Twice the vanity, half the responsibility.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=thinking,I don't make any effort to look beautiful, so I see why ~player~ would want two of you instead...
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue...I'm sure Parfet would like working with you, if you do engineering.
3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=disappointed,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off...once she learns to pronounce "San Fransokyo."
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak...that's why its soldiers are so ruthless, even to us.
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman...but military service <i>isn't</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soldiers...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.
3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'll try to reserve judgment...but know that it's a rare soldier that earns anything but my contempt.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Bless you--oh, <i>no</i>.  Don't tell me...
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Not <i>this</i> again.  The blonde version?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,God bless you--oh, damn it.  She's changed back...
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Bless--damn it, that was Launch.  Here we go again...
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy enough to vary your attire?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.  As well as letting you change outfits.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford a wardrobe change, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,I should have expected a wealthy woman to change her wardrobe...I would, too, if I owned anything.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,You work in a team of women?  And your outfit is different...we don't really have uniforms, either.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself.  And has the finances to vary her outfit.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  That's rare on Mejare...you'd turn heads.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Is that common on Earth?  Few Mejarians are that way...
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Dark skin...besides Valore and Amarone, I'm not sure I know any Mejarian women like you.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=thinking,Most Mejarians are pale, but your skin is dark.  So is Valore's...but that's beside the point.
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...With <i>magic</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  I guess <i>magic</i> would make you worthy of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=thinking,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  Well, she can't use <i>magic</i>...
3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...but magic might give you a good reason to think that.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?  Especially with men's mechanical sidearms?
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot quieter than those racketous male ones.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.  She likes men's mechanical guns.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought those clunky men's guns to a card game.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...Is there a reason you keep waving those clunky kinetic guns around?  Women should know better than to use male weapons.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...You don't need to start any fights.  I certainly don't want to hear the racket of those men's sidearms you've got.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,I'll never understand Barnette's fixation on clunky men's guns...or yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,See what too much makeup leads to, Jura?  You shouldn't concern yourself with it.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing...but just as unkempt.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She wears glasses, too...and she sometimes neglects hygiene.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together...and didn't teach her how to clean herself.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build..and Parfet's glasses.  Are you old enough to be here?  You should have cleaned yourself, regardless.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds...Parfet gets like that, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,I suppose your suit is next.  I <i>did</i> kindly set an example for you to follow.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=interested,Come on, Ochako...the boysuit is no issue.  I did it without complaining.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,The suit, then?  Just shut your eyes and remember how I achieved the same.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,There's nothing shameful about losing your bodysuit...<i>I</i> did it, after all.  You'll be fine.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,I'm told you were cryogenically frozen for some time...that's also true of Misty, a young girl I know from Pluto.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,Is it true you were in cryosleep for a number of years?  So was a man I know...he looks younger than me, but he's over a hundred years old.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,Someone mentioned you were in cryosleep for some time.  It sounds uncomfortable...maybe you don't want to talk about it.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,You were cryogenically frozen, correct?  Several of my crewmates were, as well...technically making them older than any of us.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=pleased,Barnette's got green hair, too...but that's with the help of Mejarian genetic engineering.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=calm,Green hair isn't that strange on Mejare.  One of my pilots has it.  What about Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=impressed,Is your hair naturally green?  That'd be impressive for an Earth woman...
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  What do you think, Jura?  Was it for owning an anatomy book?
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...like us.

3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's this "America" planet known for?  Tall women?
3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You report the news?  I was on the news as a little girl...wish I wasn't.

3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you meant to come dressed in a cat costume, it seems to be missing a few pieces.

3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,The choker's next.

3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,My school experiences...weren't the best.  But I'm curious what you've been learning in this Academy of yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shy...that's normally what I expect from students.  What is it you've been taught, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A student?  I dropped out of school...I had to learn piloting the hard way.  What's taught in "Beacon Academy"?

3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=addressing,I'm sure you wanted to pack on more jewelry, but were too absentminded to do it.  So dress it is.

3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,Not to be rude, but I still can't comprehend this.  Are you shaving...<i>the rest of it</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,...Is the bottom fur next?  Did you really come here naked?
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,To meet a cat-woman hybrid here, and that she's not even wearing anything...I assume what's around your groin is fur, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,You've only lost once before, but I think I know what's coming next.  If it, too, is fur...
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're some kind of covert agent?  I'd be lying if I said I was good at sniffing those out.
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,Speaking of covert agents...I think we gave B.C. a newfound respect for women.
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,The Nirvana's had its share of covert agents.  They tend to warm up to our cause.
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=impressed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  I suppose the Paksis isn't all that different...
3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  We've had our issues with hostile red light in the past.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,The same person, both male and female...that shreds any doubts I had about men and women being the same species.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,I wonder what Hibiki would look like as a woman...probably taller, honestly.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Tarakkian scientists.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,The same person, one born on Mejare and the other on Tarak.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women, and I'm not sure which one is prettier.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You don't quite seem dressed for the occasion here.  Unless you'd rather just get it over with.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking,Just like challenging yourself, based on how little you're wearing?  I just rushed over in what I usually wear.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,At least you seem to like the attention.  Based on your outfit, you're going to attract a lot of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You've got enough energy for both of us.  Neither of us is wearing very much, though...

3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough...but magic sounds like a good motivator.

3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and the "Borg" sounds suspiciously similar to the Harvest.  We'll watch out for them.

3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Unless she's heading to Mejare soon, I can't see that relationship working out.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You seem far more interested, Jura.  She <i>is</i> blonde, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe <i>you</i> could flirt with her and bring her back.  Barnette could use some target practice.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe if she agreed to join the crew...but what from I hear, she <i>hunts</i> pirates.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I don't think people will be confused.  This woman seems a lot more well-known on this planet.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,One letter can make all the difference...just like one mistake.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,If you actually got us confused, I'd have Duero check your eyes before you posed a danger to the team.

3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=addressing,I shouldn't pry as to how you lost your arm...but is that mechanical replacement useful?
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,You're a fiery one.  Like if Barnette and Jura had their child...hopefully she'd have her arm.

3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A <i>concession</i>?  I thought you were going to tease me all night.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I'm sure she has her reasons.  Stoicism is important for a leader...

3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You're certainly dressed for it.
3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I have to ask...I don't know Earth's power structure.
3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...even if they dress that way.

3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Valore never called herself a genie...
3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  B.C. never calls herself a genie...but then, she doesn't exactly count.
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,"Pearl"?  Jura's already a big fan of yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,What was that transformation you did earlier?  That was impressive...you had a full suit on!
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Didn't you come here with a pink suit on?  How'd you take it off so quickly?  All I saw was light...
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,Did you...<i>transform</i> earlier?  What was that all about?  I'm curious...
3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Weren't you wearing a suit like mine just before?  ...Besides the pink.  How did you transform out of it?
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Amarone.
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Valore.
3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Mejare has detectives...but they mostly investigate enemies of the state.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Anyone who focuses on discovering secrets is probably hiding a few themselves.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  Are men any good in school?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  More nuanced than Mejare's, I hope.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem about as expressive as <i>I</i> ever get.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I feel your pain.  I command a short, overconfident man myself.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,Well, this is <i>one</i> way to grow closer to your colleagues.  I sure wouldn't want any crewmates here.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Surely a <i>goddess</i> wouldn't need a man to help her.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=awkward,Australians sure have a unique...manner of speaking.
3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=disappointed,...How exactly did this "Australia" develop its dialect?
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...who's the Oma going to be?
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=impressed,Someone said you're with a woman...have the two of you gotten pregnant yet?
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I guess.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Oh, good, another Meia.  Now I can take a day off of bossing Jura around.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Look at that, Jura.  The worst day of your life.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Playing with more than one of me is sweet.  Have you extended the same love to Jura here?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,I'm glad you like me enough to play with more than one of me, ~player~.  Do you like Jura, too?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.  And you don't really have the wardrobe for this game...
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,A "goddess"?  I'm sorry if I ever called you vain, Jura.  This is a new one.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You have some competition for extravagant dress, Jura.  And vanity, apparently.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  Rabat probably considers himself one.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  I can appreciate getting the job done quickly.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=bored,An assassin...there's nothing subtle about our Dreads, unfortunately.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,As assassin, you said?  One of the reasons I prefer Mejarian laser rigns is their subtlety.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Wha--<i>don't bring up Misty</i>!  It's not like she'll understand.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,You--I--Misty and I are not an <i>item</i>.  I just give her advice.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You know perfectly well Misty's into <i>men</i>, Jura...and also that she's too young.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Why do you try to twist my relationship with Misty into love?  She just...needs guidance.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I can see two reasons why you and Jura are going to get along this evening.  And your martial arts skills aren't one of them.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Finishing strong is important, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,You're better than this, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=thinking,Dita sometimes makes mistakes under pressure, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Assuming that style exists anywhere, it's too conspicuous.  This coloration blends into machinery.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,She can be as bubbly as she wants.  I doubt she has the responsibilities you or I carry.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,She looks young, Jura...and in a better position.  She can afford to be happy, so let her.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wherever she comes from, I'm sure that pattern is optimal.  She must wear it for a reason.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  Might even make <i>Jura</i> jealous.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=bored,...About as much on as <i>Barnette</i> ever layers.  And she has a certain reputation for baring it all.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,Do you have someone to support you?  This switching can't be good for your mental health...or physical.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=calm,Your blonde version seems liable to get you killed.  Do you have friends?  Colleagues?  Are you alright?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,I'd hate to see you wander around with your...condition.  Are you sure you're safe, always switching as you do?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=thinking,Earth women are full of surprises...do you want to live on the Nirvana, just to have some support?
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=confused,...<i>Protagonist</i>?  You're talking like she's fictional.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=bored,<i>What</i> are you going on about?  <i>Gaming</i>?  <i>Protagonists</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  A year?  By what measure?  What are you talking about?
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus like this?  She's standing right here.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman.  I'm not sure if <i>Gascogne</i> could measure up to you...
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,Earth women can get pretty tall, it seems...but so can Mejarians, and I believe the gravity's the same.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think Gascogne's still got an inch on you, so don't feel self-conscious about your size.
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=awkward,Do men like tall women?  I'm about middle-of-the-pack in that regard...
3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,You carry yourself well for your height, though you seem a little uneasy.  Do you not get out much?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,What...does that have to with anything?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,...I don't even know what Street Fighter <i>1</i> is.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=confused,There's an <i>industry</i> for these...<i>things</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,I don't know what it was before, so I don't think <i>revolutionizing</i> it would mean much to me...
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that headband some sort of designation?  Not to be rude.
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a "ninja"?  Sounds like the telepathic people Hibiki was stuck with.
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=bored,You're awfully quiet.  Not that I take issue with that...
3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=confused,So these "ninjas" have their own society?  What separates you from a typical human?
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's, and your sword like Jura's here.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.  But the sword is distinctly Jura.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, learn from this woman and actually use your sword properly.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,As long as you've got that sword, could you teach Jura how to use it?  That rapier of hers is just for show.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little on edge.  It's just a card game.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's an interesting streak in your hair.  Mejarians have unusual hair colors, but not on specific parts...the red matches your attitude.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm told you spend a lot of time fighting woman authority figures.  Guess we're not so different...even if your demeanor is a bit acerbic.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That red streak seems to betray your attitude.  Just try to relax...
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=impressed,You go to school for "magic"?  That...sounds rather fascinating, actually.
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun...but I suppose magic would have made it easier.
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't have good memories of school...maybe you could talk about your magic instead?
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm told you can use magic.  Sometimes the Paksis feels that way...we certainly never had any schooling on the subject.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...I thought <i>Marinette</i> was Ladybug.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,...So what you're saying is, Marinette made her public debut before Samus?
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  Sounds old...Marinette doesn't look old, especially not older than Samus.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus and Marinette like this?  I'm totally lost...
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=confused,Are...you OK?  You're all clammed up...
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like a schoolgirl.  Are you sure you want to be here?  Is someone making you do this?
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you alright...Saki, was it?  You look so nervous...
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Saki?  That's you, right?  You've hardly said a thing...and you're turning red.
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've seen better days...and are about to see worse ones.  Are you sure you want to play this?
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type, based on those weapons.  Guess you can't trust a soldier to leave them behind, even here.
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got a sweet expression for all those weapons you're carrying.  It's unsettling.
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you brought weapons here?  What kind of place is this?
3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You're a military woman?  You've got the uncomfortably sweet expression of one, for sure.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=calm,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches <i>yours</i>, Jura.  Can't say the arm does, though.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You're a fiery one.  How'd you lose your arm?
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,What do you think, Jura?  Should we have our arms replaced with robotics?
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford that, if you wanted.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,Haven't you played cards before?  Aren't you wealthy enough to own a <i>casino</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though you've probably got more money than my whole crew.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  Even if it's only on finances.
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, take instructions from this woman so you can actually put that rapier to use.
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Hunting space pirates?  Some pirates have a good reason for what they do...
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...And you hunt <i>space pirates</i>.  I see.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you travel through space, too...and hunt space pirates.  Good luck with that.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,There's a pirate named Rabat I wouldn't mind you catching for us...since you travel through space.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...and origin.
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree, Samus?  Even out in space...
3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and you <i>hunt space pirates</i>?  I'll keep that in mind.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  Duero seems that way, too, even if he only shows it to Parfet.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Take that how you will.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Besides Duero, I can't picture a man sitting still.
3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=thinking,You're into art, you said?  Artists are good to have around...they tend not to kill people.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...look, Jura, another one.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You're a fiery one...she's how I picture your and Barnette's daughters, Jura.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of Jura here.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,What are you waving that thing around for?  Guns aren't children's playthings!
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,Put the gun down, would you?  What are you so afraid of?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...An acerbic, bestial woman waving a racketous mechanical gun around.  Just how I pictured Earth women.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,I can understand wanting to be armed in a seedy place like this, but you're taking this too far.  And don't wave it around!
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...

3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I suppose.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, you're...a "clown"?  You shouldn't put yourself down like that...unless it's some kind of profession?
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly does a "clown" do for a living?  Are you some kind of public entertainer?
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, clowns...entertain people?  All the entertainment on Mejare tends to focus on the evils of men.
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard you were a "clown," which sounds a little degrading.  You don't seem too broken up about it, though.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,It's good to see a fellow pilot!  You even look a little like Belvedere.
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,You raid tombs?  All of Earth is ancient history is Mejare, not just dead queens.
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you certainly look fit, which is good to see in a woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,<i>Tombs</i>, you said?  Not for me...too cramped.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.
3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is it true you're a "mutant"?  Forgive my ignorance, but you look quite human to me.
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=awkward,For a supposed mutant, you look very human.  Maybe it's an Earth custom I'm missing...
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,I was told you're a mutant.  Considering your very human appearance, I think that warrants an explanation.
3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,Would you mind explaining what they meant when they said you're a "mutant"?  Is that just a term for some subset of Earthlings?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Interesting skin color.  Are you even human?  Or an Earthling?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare has strange hair colors...apparently Earth has strange <i>skin</i> colors.
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confused,I'm not sure what's more distracting: the skin color, or the wings.  Are you from Earth?
3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really thought this was Planet Earth.  I wasn't aware people here could be so...colorful.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,What now, Jura?  Some actual clothing?
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,Lost again?  Maybe you'll follow the rules this time.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Try to make this interesting, Jura...or at least in accordance with the rules.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Try to strip some <i>clothing</i> this time.  I'm in my underwear; it's not that painful.
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,Out of everyone here, you seem remarkably...normal.  In a way, that's refreshing.
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,As far as I can tell, you're quite standard for Earth women.  Don't take that as an insult...
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Hm.  Not sure what to make of you.  You seem rather straightforward.
3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=bored,As normal as can be...which is why I'm wary.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,You just want attention...
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,I wanted a challenge, and I get <i>you</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,Just looking over here...
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,For God's sake...
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,You look like you're in great shape.  I respect that in a woman...very much.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Not to be too forward, but...your legs are so muscular.  What's your training routine?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Wow...whatever you do to exercise, I'd like to learn it.  You look fantastic.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman, and in a good way.  Could I get your frame with enough training?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Your build is impressive...and I wouldn't say to that to <i>any</i> strange woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Congratulations, ~player~.  You've found what are probably my rarest lines.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  You must really like me, ~player~.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  Honestly, ~player~, that's a little flattering.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=pleased,I see Earth has also perfected cloning technology.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Glad you appreciate me enough to play with more than one of me.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  That's...a little cute, ~player~.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,More than one of me?  Considering my responsibilities, that would really help.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,Would you look at that, ~player~'s figured out the offline version.  And apparently is very fond of me.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,More than one Meia?  How flattering.  Be sure to try out Jura, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Never thought I'd say <i>these</i> lines.  I'm glad you like me so much, ~player~.  That's sweet.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--how could anyone be so--<i>are you serious</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,What a disgusting woman, offering so bluntly...wait, <i>you're letting her</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Unbelievable that someone could be so lecherous...wait, <i>what</i>?  Don't let her touch you!
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Wha--Jura, you don't even know this woman!  Don't let her near you!  Doesn't this place have rules about that?
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you report the news?  Mejare's news agencies are all state propaganda.
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,I'm not a fan of the media...my family has had some bad publicity on Mejare.
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're <i>reporting</i> this?  The last time I appeared on television, I was a little girl...
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I appeared on Mejarian television not too far back.  We were raiding an armory.
3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see a woman who shares my fashion sense...though it looks like a tight fit.
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off.  What <i>planet</i> are you from?
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,That's an...interesting skin color.  And speech pattern.  Who <i>are</i> you, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you feast on men's energy, or something to that effect?  Way to confirm what Tarakkians already think.
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shapely.  Is that how a "succubus" lures men into her traps?
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=confused,Is all that really necessary?  And are those real wings?  I heard you say you were a <i>succubus</i>...
3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=bored,You might actually give Jura some competition with that figure.  She's hunting for men herself...
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,You said you were a "Street Fighter," correct?  I suppose that <i>would</i> get you into shape.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,You said something about street fighting?  I've been in street fights.  I'd rather not go back to that, but if you like it...
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You said you're a street fighter?  That's a harsh life...I lived on the streets when I was younger.
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,Street fighting isn't the kind of thing I'd glorify, but if it makes you happy...just take care of yourself.
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I won with <i>that</i>?  Embarrassing...
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=disappointed,I won with a <i>high card</i>...it still feels like a loss.
3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=bored,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Losing would have been more satisfying...
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.  Of course, Mejare's schools tried to do the same.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too?  Until recently we never got far past the Mejarian system.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,It took an accidental wormhole to actually fling us out of the Mejarian system.  <i>Your</i> Earth is a lot more adventurous.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Everyone on Earth, exploring space in peace and harmony?  This Star Fleet sounds nice.  Tarak and Mejare can't even unite the sexes.
3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll agree that traveling through space teaches you a lot about other civilizations.  The colonies we've run into have all been different.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type...though a rather unintimidating one.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  You <i>claim</i> to protect, but only when it suits you.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=bored,Oh, perfect.  A soldier.  Try not to kill anyone for fun before the game is over.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The ones I know enjoy indoctrinating children and shutting down housing districts.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Earth was devastated many years ago, so it started using its colonies as organ farms.  Mejare is the uterus colony...so there's no men.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=thinking,We've come to know a few men, actually...but Earth's organ-harvesting is why Mejare is nothing but women.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Mejare is just one of Earth's many colonies.  It was intentionally settled as women-only for Earth to harvest reproductive organs.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,Jura wanted to come here <i>because</i> we don't know much about men.  Earth harvests uteri from Mejare, so there's no need for them.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,What's that phrase you keep saying?  "Plus Ultra"?  What does that mean?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,Why do you keep saying "Plus Ultra"?  Is that some sort of battle cry?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=calm,...What's the meaning of that "Plus Ultra" phrase you keep repeating?  Is it for teambuilding or just personal confidence?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,Are you a student...?  I went to state schools on Mejare when I was a little girl...
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,Are you a student...?  How do men behave in school, anyway?
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.
3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,Are you a student?  I dropped out of school...
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,More streaks like that, and I may have to consider you for a pilot spot.
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Did you mean to go so long without losing?
3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=disappointed,You've been almost zenlike...like the people on Anpathos.
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,Someone said you gave up on school.  So did I...
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like you get a lot of exercise.  Always good to see in a woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=disappointed,You said something about a <i>killer</i>?  Earth's no stranger to killing, as far as I'm concerned.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...You can't be serious.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...<i>Excuse me</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...Can't you take this seriously?  Can't you <i>pretend</i> to do so?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,I--who are you?  How'd you get in here?
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,...What in Ma's name am I looking at?  Are you <i>human</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I'll be perfectly honest.  You look inhuman.
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,Er...what <i>are</i> you, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I thought the <i>Harvest</i> was terrifying.  My God.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I just don't understand.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,You can't run away from your problems, Florina...I've tried.
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,I appreciate women that stand their ground against their fears...
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,Running away doesn't solve anything...your fears can always run faster.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=impressed,These "Evas" I've heard of actually seem like impressive technology.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You said something about "Evas" before?  My Dread sounds a lot more reliable...but still, they sound fearsome.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Evas" sound like they're not to be trifled with.  Good thing the Earth I know doesn't have any.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'm told you hold some authority in a military organization.  I hope you're using that responsibly.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,A military woman?  Excuse me for not being impressed.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You don't seem quite as fiercely repulsive as the woman soldiers I've come to know.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,Military...nothing worse than having a soldier around.  Try not to kill anyone.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...pure black is an interesting choice, if it's intentional.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...I don't think I know anyone with pure black hair.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  That black hair is imposing...as is your stark outfit.
3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though no pilot of mine has pure black hair.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches Jura's.  So does your intensity.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,You're a fiery one...like if Barnette and Jura had their child, finally.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of some of my crewmates.
3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager...and your dress doesn't seem too protective.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...are Earth women realy like this?
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=bored,You seem to know us all pretty well...perhaps a little <i>too</i> well, if you follow.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a lawyer.  I'm assuming that means you work with the law?  Mejare's laws are absolute.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,You "practice law," correct?  Where I come from, laws are handed down...and no one can argue them.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,What does a lawyer do, exactly?  Mejare doesn't allow women to argue the laws...if we could, men might be considered human.
3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare doesn't allow legal arguments...and being a pirate, I'm on the wrong side of them.  But law is what you work with, correct?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=confused,Let's make sure I understand this.  You go to a whole <i>school</i> of people with powers like yours?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2,marker:dropout=thinking,I actually dropped out of school as a girl...perhaps if that school was full of women with superpowers, I might have stayed.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I'm very curious about this "Academy" of yours.  And every student has powers like you do?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=thinking,School was never a pleasant experience for me...but then, I didn't have superpowers.  What's this Academy of yours like, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we won't be here long.
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=confused,Are you counting each bandage as one layer?  If not, this'll be over soon.
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really wasn't counting on seeing nudity this quickly.  At least it's a woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Did I just walk in on a game that's nearly over?
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.
3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,"Black Canary"?  I <i>wish</i> Mejare had canaries...
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Sorry to be insulting, but you look rather unevenly-proportioned.  You should exercise more.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look you're giving everyone?  This is just a game.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,I'm trying not to comment on your body...Mejarians tend to be judgmental enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you seems off.  I'd suggest you relax.
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,They said you're a student...but something about you seems intense.  Like you know more than you let on...
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a student.  The uniform matches...but something in your eyes doesn't.
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I know this is rude, but...something seems off about you.  What did you say you did?  You're a student?
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,For a supposed student, there's something about the way you carry yourself that makes me wary...like you're one step ahead of us.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Good to see another woman who shares my fashion sense.  Even the color scheme is close...
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,My bodysuit is pretty standard among Mejarian styles...but looking at you, maybe it was inspired by Earth.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Bodysuits are comfortable, aren't they?  And efficient, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,That bodysuit of yours looks awfully similar to my own.  I don't think I could pull off that helmet, though.
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why is your skin pink?  Do you have a medical condition?  Earth is no stranger to poisoning populations it doesn't care for...
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...and you look a little sickly with that skin.  Were you poisoned?  Did Earth do this to you?
3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you alright?  Your skin...it's pink, and it looks unhealthy.  I wouldn't put it past Earth to do this to undesirables...
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Are you...feeling OK?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You...<i>want</i> to strip?
3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,I...who <i>are</i> you?
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,You got to school with <i>men</i>?  Can't even imagine...
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,These "vampires" of yours sound like if the Harvest were even more supernatural than it already is.  Fearsome.
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,You work with computers?  I think Parfet's dabbled with them, though she likes machinery better.  Do they help with vampires?
3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Tell me more about these "vampires."  If they exist, I'm sure Earth will send them our way soon enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You seem like you're getting nervous.  Is something wrong, Ochako?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,...Ochako, you're blushing.  A lot.  What's the matter?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=confused,...Aren't you just taking your belt off?  What's the matter?  You're beet red.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You're blushing, Ochako...and sweating, too.  Is something wrong?  Do you need help?
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So, you're...some sort of "princess"?  Not sure I know what that is...
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So...does "princess" mean "light dresser"?  That would make more than a few of my crewmates princesses.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,...Could you explain what a "princess" is?  I'm...not from Earth, so I don't know its titles.
3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is a "princess" a position of power on Earth?  You'd think an authority figure would wear more clothing...
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Her sleeves are next.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,The sleeves aren't part of the dress.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Your sleeves.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Your sleeves.  There, I saved us all the anticipation.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,This is how Jura treats <i>everyone</i>.  She's quite proud of herself...and to be fair, no disasters have struck because of her.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,I'll start reprimanding Jura when she starts getting women killed.  For now it's just an annoyance.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,I'm the squadron leader, yes, but Jura's second-in-command.  Besides, she hasn't gotten anyone killed yet...
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Jura's second-in-command.  She usually does her job...she just tends to get distracted with <i>this</i> sort of thing during downtime.
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=confused,...Where's your body, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,You look like a miniature Paksis.  Any relation?
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like the Paksis sprouted wings and shrunk.
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you big enough to hold the cards?
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly full of energy.  Might even rival Dita, though I could never picture her playing this.
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Wherever this <i>Australia</i> planet is, its food must be nutritious.  You're energetic.
3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=pleased,You're pretty energetic.  That's good to see in a pilot, and I suppose Dita proves discipline isn't a necessity.
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm a pirate, too...small universe we live in.
3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  Well...the outfit is certainly different, and apparently the manner.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm told you're into art.  If you want that life-sized portrait, Jura, here's your chance.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You're from some kind of ninja village, was it?  And what's a ninja, for that matter?
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=impressed,These "ninjas" of yours sound a lot like the telepathic people Hibiki got stuck with...
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,Not to be rude, but what's the significance of your facial markings?
3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=disappointed,Facial markings...I think Rabat's people have some, too.  Not that I trust them.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=confused,You're...a little thin on clothes to be playing this, don't you think?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  You've barely got anything on.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've heard of Valentine's Day...but that's for love, not indecency.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=bored,Shouldn't you have come to a strip poker game...<i>clothed</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=pleased,That's about how much Barnette wears with her apron.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,Jura's no fighter, but something tells me you and she would get along.  Two things, actually.
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a..."princess"?  For nobility, you don't seem too informed...
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Then why are you here?
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She'd never lower herself to games like this...
3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though I suppose you're lowering yourself by playing this.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that a camera?  Paiway, our child nurse, is always skulking around with hers...so this is nothing new.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=bored,A camera?  Are you really going to photograph us all?  ...Whatever.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you trying to blackmail us with that camera?  I've been in the media for far worse than this.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hope you don't think you're going to embarrass me with that camera.  I'm not exactly from here, anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  With a brooch and everything...you look the part.
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  The crown leads me in that direction...
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  That's who rules Mejare...
3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...the title doesn't make the woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,Videl...you keep mentioning your "dad."  What's a dad?
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...what's a father?
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,Took me too long, but at least I finally tagged you.  Seems our outfits are much closer now, too.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,I suppose I just needed to start dressing like you to get in your head.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,Makes sense that I finally read your face.  I'm covering about as much skin now.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,You've been playing well, Jura.  You've already reduced me to the same scant clothing you wear all the time.
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,This "magic" of yours sounds pretty interesting.  Can it be taught?
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're immortal.  Is that in the sense of never aging, or never dying at all?
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,If you really <i>can</i> wield magic, I'd be honored to learn it...it sounds useful.
3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=calm,The Paksis has proven to me that powers beyond human ability exist...so I'm willing to believe you might have some.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You said you come from the plains?  Sounds nice...Mejare's not very verdant, and Tarak's even worse.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You come from the plains, you said?  My parents took me to the plains when I was a little girl...it was fun to run around.
3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,The plains, you said you lived in?  Somehow I doubt the Earth I know has any green left...
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,You're doing it <i>again</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So does Jura here.  Fire away.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  This is your chance, Jura.  Make connections.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I was told you were a spacefarer, as well...and a pilot.  Good to see a woman who understands my situation.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Is it true you're a space pilot?  So am I...I'd love to discuss formations or maneuvers after the game is over.
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're a pilot.  I never expected to meet a woman like that here...what's your ship like?
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I heard you're a space pilot.  I command a Dread squadron myself...what is it that you do?
3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone told me you're a space pilot.  I've really fallen in love with piloting myself, though I only have a few years' experience...
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Wha--<i>what are you doing</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't wave that thing around!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't fire that thing!
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,<i>Where's your trigger discipline</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Why did you <i>bring</i> that thing?
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=impressed,Even for an Earth woman, that looks like pretty old-fashioned dress.  Your manners are similarly classical...
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,I could have sworn I saw you at another table than this one...guess it must have been a similarly passive woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=confused,How'd you lose that bit of your finger?  You seem rather demure to be in combat...
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem very assertive.  I wouldn't think this game would attract a shy woman like you...
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,So you do unsavory work for this old woman you know?  I work for an old woman, too...she approached <i>me</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you're the type who clings to the past, ~player~.  That isn't healthy.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you aware there's a superior Velma character now, ~player~?  Don't cling to nostalgia like a fool.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and inform you there's a better Velma available for play now, ~player~.  This is Velma Classic.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=bored,Still using the inferior characters of the past, just because they're comfortable...listen, ~player~, the game has evolved.  So should you.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Velma Classic is just here for posterity, ~player~.  The Velma of today is far more on-model.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=bored,...Well, we know what your favorite color is, don't we?  Even your <i>hair</i> is purple...
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,Purple hair, purple outfit...even on Mejare, purple hair is a bit outlandish.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,I have some crewmates who wish their hair was a more exotic color, like your purple.  I suppose I should consider my blue strange...
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is that purple hair your natural color?  Where are you from?
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=thinking,Time travel...if it's true, I'm curious what you've actually used it for.  Unless you'd rather hide that...
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  You look like you're about to cast off that dress and go running.
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You seem more like a dressed-up athlete.
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She's certainly not as athletic as <i>you</i> look.
3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though you might have an athletic edge on me.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,At least your <i>hair</i> is expressive.
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Jura.  Always bragging about her looks...although she might be more justified in doing so.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=unimpressed,Taking another inch off of the stems?  Surely you can think of another way to waste our time.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,In case you were wondering, that's twice that you should've lost now.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=annoyed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=addressing,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outfit that attracts men?  You'll have an easy time finding a man, then, Jura.
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Talk to Jura about it...
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,<i>Now</i> are you done?  Or are you going to summon vines and perpetuate this?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Stripping your flowers now?  Any more vegetation we should know about?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Is a bush next?  Are you stripping flowers and replacing them with branches?
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that...
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She's blind without her glasses, too...no mystery there.  But you solve those, yes?
3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Are you any good with machines?  Or purely a mystery-solver?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is it true you're a "princess"?  I'm told you hold some authority...which makes me question why you're here.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,I'm told you're a ruler of some sort...shouldn't you be <i>ruling</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,I hear you're an authority figure where you're from.  I'm sure your subjects appreciate you spending your time like this.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,My experience with authority has always been that they don't deserve their power...you being here reinforces that.
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You were trapped...in a computer?  I guess we were trapped in the Paksis once...
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live in a...muh-more-puh-guh?
3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is this "muh-more-puh-guh" how Earthlings pass the time?  You should be working.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's this about wrestling?  ...Sounds like a male pursuit.  Physical posturing...
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,You...what <i>are</i> you?  Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.  What <i>are</i> you, exactly?
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...I hope you don't think the floating and lack of eyes is normal to us.  Or maybe it <i>is</i> on Earth...
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...and you don't seem happy to be here.
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that...since you seem annoyed regardless.
3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here...and you seem miserable about it, anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=confused,"Dark Magician Girl"?  That's some sort of <i>title</i>, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't you have some sort of first name?  "Dark Magician Girl" is too long to say in the heat of battle.
3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Dark Magician <i>Girl</i>?  Children aren't allowed here.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...now we have a <i>goddess</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.  Though it seems your world has more nature...
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.  Seems you live in a world with vegetation...
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...feeling alright, Orendi?
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,We've never run into aliens in our travels...didn't think I'd meet one <i>here</i>.  And you're certainly alien.
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...<i>aware</i> of the rest of us?
3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=bored,...Would you please stop shouting?  Whatever you are...
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work as a <i>model</i>?  You and Jura here should talk.
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Isn't that you've always wanted, Jura?
3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Seems Earth women are capable of being vain, too, Jura...and models.  Have fun with this girl.

4-male_human_must_strip=addressing,Ever heard of sortieing?
4-male_human_must_strip=addressing,No excuses, ~player~...
4-male_human_must_strip=addressing,You're so predictable...just the way men are, I suppose.
4-male_human_must_strip=interested,If you thought this would shake me, think again...
4-male_human_must_strip=addressing,Read you like a book...
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You should pay more attention to your cards...and less on your opponents.
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Can a man not focus on two things at once?
4-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Don't blame luck...there's always an adjustment you could have made.
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
4-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=thinking,No need to antagonize him...it's hard being alone.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,I can respect having the courage to come alone.  Jura's the only reason I came here at all...
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,Can't say I'm thrilled about a man playing at all, but at least he didn't bring friends.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=bored,Jura dragging me here at all isn't what I'd call supportive, Rinkah.
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I won with <i>that</i>?  Poor show, ~player~.
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,I won with a <i>high card</i>...maybe I'll strip just to put myself at ease.
4-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Come on, I <i>deserved</i> that loss.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=happy,Good streak.  I'm glad I got to play against you...
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Don't lose your streak now...you'll regret it.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Nice run...but I'm in control.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,You had us pinned down...for a while.
4-male_must_strip=addressing,Ever heard of sortieing?

4-male_must_strip=addressing,You're so predictable.  Just the way men are, I suppose.

4-male_must_strip=addressing,Read you like a book.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really, ~player~?  You picked <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really?  Over 100 characters and you pick <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've <i>seen</i> men.  You're Kool-Aid <i>monster</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...Have some respect for yourself, ~player~.  <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Unless it's April Fool's Day, you shouldn't be picking this character.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,If this is what Earthlings find attractive, I'm glad the colonists left.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,I'm not sure how to feel about being picked by the same player who'd choose <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,You must really hate me to stick me on a table with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=pleased,I never thought I'd meet a man shorter than Hibiki...but you might be the one.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who let this...<i>child</i> in here?
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Men really do come in all shapes and sizes.  You might as well be a woman.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you?  You look like a child.  Get out.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,I'm no expert on men, but you look like a prepubescent one...never mind the cat ears.  Children aren't allowed here.
4-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,We shouldn't be playing with this child here.  This is wrong...
4-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I won with <i>that</i>?  Poor show, ~name~...
4-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,I won with a <i>high card</i>...maybe I'll strip just to put myself at ease.

4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Judging by his attitude, men are a lot more shy about nudity...which only makes this more curious.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=awkward,You two must be close, then.  Good to know men and women can be this comfortable around each other...I suppose.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,It's definitely a unique coincidence.  But being nude together is no issue for us...I wonder if that's true for these two.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Jura and I shower together, since the ship only has the communal bathroom...is that true for you two, as well?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...That's a man, Jura.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I'm no expert, but I think Corrin is a <i>man</i>, actually.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I think Corrin's a man, Jura.  Though he <i>does</i> look feminine.
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,...I've seen enough men to know you're not human.
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly...<i>are</i> you?
4-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=disappointed,So <i>gay</i> is the term Earthlings use?  Sounds sort of derisive.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Now</i> are you taking off that ridiculous blindfold?  Or...<i>tactical visor</i>.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,So are you forfeiting, or are you finally deciding to let yourself see?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Attached to that blindfold?  Either give up the game or take off that thing...your move.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
4-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=calm,You might be handsomer if you grew your hair out.  Duero makes it work.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=happy,Good streak.  I'm glad I got to play against you.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Don't lose your streak now.  You'll regret it.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Nice run.  But I'm in control.
4-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,You had us pinned down.  For a while.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Jura, do you think you could learn from this man?  Perhaps nonverbally?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't seem too talkative, but I'm told you can handle a sword.  You could stand to learn something from this man, Jura.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Barely talks, skilled with a sword?  Look at that, Jura.  He's everything you're not.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Can't you take this seriously, ~player~?
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,~player~, you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,You put <i>Shaggy Blanco</i> on a table with me?  Do you really hate me that much?
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I wish I could understand what you're saying.  Maybe then I'd get something out of this joke.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,At least you started working out.  You're still all unkempt.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=disappointed,White's not a popular color among Mejarians...you can imagine why.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,Not sure how to take this.  You picked <i>me</i>...but apparently I'm only worthy of playing with Shaggy Blanco.
4-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=addressing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to a joke character?  You underestimate me, ~player~.
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=impressed,You're...a <i>man</i>?  Not like one I've ever seen.
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you speaking through a translator?  Is that some archaic Earth language?
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Earth languages besides the common tongue are a mystery to me.  Even Tarakkian code is not something I've ever concerned myself with.
4-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Facial markings?  Like Rabat's people.  I'll keep that in mind, Earth-man.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,What is this "Pod" you keep referring to?  What does it do?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Are you going to explain what your "Pod" is, or are we all supposed to ignore it?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll bite.  What's this "Pod" you keep mentioning?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm curious about this "Pod" of yours.  I suppose you wanted me to ask about that, since you said it out loud.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=impressed,Wait, you two work together?  That's...very awkward.  Jura and I split up when we came here...
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,I see even on Earth, the superiority of women is clearly entrenched.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  The captain is quite a bit older than I am...
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  I sure wouldn't want <i>Hibiki</i> playing this with me.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,And I thought <i>Hibiki</i> was outgoing...
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,Well...you're certainly enthusiastic.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,We're all right here.  You don't have to shout.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is "captain" an actual designation, or just what you call yourself?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard there's a female version of you.  What kept <i>her</i> away?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,And I thought <i>Bart's</i> outfits could be garish.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress more garishly than Bart.  I wonder how <i>you'd</i> look bald.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,Never thought I'd meet a <i>man</i> with my fashion sense.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you were frozen for decades.  Hibiki was that way, too...
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Hibiki could certainly benefit from that...not that he'd ever accept.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Seems unbecoming of a man to take the easy way out.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,If everyone on this <i>America</i> planet is built like you, I'd hate to see the women.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you really a captain?  You seem built more to <i>take</i> orders than give them.
4-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't need to strip for me to tell you're fit.  They'd worship you on Tarak.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,They told me you're an agent, but an agent of <i>what</i>, I'm still not sure.  Perhaps you could elaborate...and take off your weapon.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=angry,Don't think I don't see that weapon.  I'm trying to be less wary of men...but an armed "agent" puts me on edge.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's my understanding you're an agent.  Well, I'm a pirate...and I didn't come armed, so perhaps you should remove your weapon.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=bored,An "agent" of a man with a weapon at his hip is making this an uncomfortable experience already.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why are you blindfolded?  Don't you want to see the cards?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you wearing a blindfold?  Are you really that confident?
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you on a bet or something?  Take your blindfold off and play seriously.
4-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Your outfit is one thing, but to be wearing a blindfold?  What's wrong with you?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=disappointed,So you <i>can</i> speak.  What was that all about?
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=annoyed,So you <i>were</i> just making fun of me...
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=bored,Grunting and screaming around women is what I'd expect from a Tarakkian.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll be honest.  You don't look like much of a man.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought men were supposed to be tall and strong.  Of course, Hibiki proves <i>that</i> wrong...
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why do you have wings?  I <i>thought</i> men were human, but maybe not.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Children aren't allowed in here, even male ones.
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You should pay more attention to your cards, and less on your opponents.
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Can a man not focus on two things at once?
4-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Don't blame luck.  There's always an adjustment you could have made.
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Maybe I just lack the experience, but...are you a man or a woman?
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Men and women have always looked pretty distinct to me...and then there's you.
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you live underground?  Sounds claustrophobic...
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
4-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,A "Street Fighter"...I've been in street fights.  Nothing to brag about.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Eternal Fighting Champion"?  You shouldn't rest on your laurels.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=impressed,I came to see a man here...you're certainly a lot of man.
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't trust you.  You have a nasty look in your eye.
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I've always regarded men as simple...but you look a little <i>too</i> complex.
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've learned that men aren't really animals...but something about you reminds me of one.
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look unhinged.  Always thought men were, but never saw one display it...
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you staring at?  Look somewhere else.
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  You look like you can barely get yourself out of bed.
4-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Man or woman, unkempt appearances don't impress me.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,The same person, both male and female...guess that cements it.  Men and women <i>are</i> the same species.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,I wonder what <i>I'd</i> look like as a man...horrifying.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Mejarian scientists.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=pleased,The same person, one born on Tarak and the other on Mejare.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women.
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
4-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,So, you help that girl fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
4-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,You seem immature...but then, Hibiki makes that work for himself.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Maybe you could talk to Jura...if you seemed capable of talking.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
4-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
4-female_human_must_strip=addressing,We're all in this together, ~player~...on a cosmic level.
4-female_human_must_strip=smug,Come on, ~player~.  I work my pilots harder than <i>this</i>...
4-female_human_must_strip=addressing,Time to scramble...
4-female_human_must_strip=addressing,When I get serious, you feel it...
4-female_human_must_strip=interested,Getting me out of my shorts isn't easy...
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Don't call it luck, ~player~...you were playing great.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,This is a great game we have going...
4-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=happy,This is shaping up to be a nice match...
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,Don't give up <i>now</i>, ~player~...
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,Pull yourself together...this isn't over.
4-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Pilots who call their victories luck...can't handle their defeats.
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I won with <i>that</i>?  Poor show, ~player~.
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,I won with a <i>high card</i>...maybe I'll strip just to put myself at ease.
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Come on, I <i>deserved</i> that loss.
4-female_must_strip=addressing,We're all in this together, ~name~.  On a cosmic level.
4-female_must_strip=smug,Come on, ~name~.  I work my pilots harder than <i>this</i>.
4-female_must_strip=addressing,Time to scramble.
4-female_must_strip=interested,When I get serious, you feel it.
4-female_must_strip=interested,Getting me out of my shorts isn't easy.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You don't quite seem dressed for the occasion here.  Unless you'd rather just get it over with.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking,Just like challenging yourself, based on how little you're wearing?  I just rushed over in what I usually wear.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,At least you seem to like the attention.  Based on your outfit, you're going to attract a lot of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You've got enough energy for both of us.  Neither of us is wearing very much, though...
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,Out of everyone here, you seem remarkably...normal.  In a way, that's refreshing.
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,As far as I can tell, you're quite standard for Earth women.  Don't take that as an insult...
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Hm.  Not sure what to make of you.  You seem rather straightforward.
4-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=bored,As normal as can be...which is why I'm wary.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,What...does that have to with anything?
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,...I don't even know what Street Fighter <i>1</i> is.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=confused,There's an <i>industry</i> for these...<i>things</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sf,marker:chi_sf=awkward,I don't know what it was before, so I don't think <i>revolutionizing</i> it would mean much to me...
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,What's this all about, Jura?  Showing a competitive edge for once?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,A spine?  That's new, coming from you.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased,I'm surprised you care whether I beat you.  I figured you considered yourself above silly games.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,That's the way.  Make me earn my victory.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Men aren't all that dangerous.  Just simpletons.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Surely you've grown up around men.  I don't have <i>that</i> benefit.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=impressed,I never thought an Earth woman would be so shy around men...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=happy,Did you slip into your native language before?  That's a little cute.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=pleased,Despite our differences, humans throughout the galaxy <i>did</i> agree on a language...

4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,My school experiences...weren't the best.  But I'm curious what you've been learning in this Academy of yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shy...that's normally what I expect from students.  What is it you've been taught, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A student?  I dropped out of school...I had to learn piloting the hard way.  What's taught in "Beacon Academy"?

4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,Earth women can get pretty tall, it seems...but so can Mejarians, and I believe the gravity's the same.
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think Gascogne's still got an inch on you, so don't feel self-conscious about your size.
4-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=awkward,Do men like tall women?  I'm about middle-of-the-pack in that regard...

4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?  Especially with men's mechanical sidearms?
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot quieter than those racketous male ones.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.  She likes men's mechanical guns.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought those clunky men's guns to a card game.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...Is there a reason you keep waving those clunky kinetic guns around?  Women should know better than to use male weapons.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...You don't need to start any fights.  I certainly don't want to hear the racket of those men's sidearms you've got.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,I'll never understand Barnette's fixation on clunky men's guns...or yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=disappointed,How could an <i>Earth woman</i> be so shy around men?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=confused,Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around men?  What's the issue?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=disappointed,If you want to learn about men, talk to Dita.  She's obsessed.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outift that attracts men?  If so, Jura will have an easy time finding one.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Jura certainly does, but I've never seen eye-to-eye with her.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,I suppose your suit is next.  I <i>did</i> kindly set an example for you to follow.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=interested,Come on, Ochako...the boysuit is no issue.  I did it without complaining.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,The suit, then?  Just shut your eyes and remember how I achieved the same.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,There's nothing shameful about losing your bodysuit...<i>I</i> did it, after all.  You'll be fine.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy enough to vary your attire?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.  As well as letting you change outfits.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford a wardrobe change, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,I should have expected a wealthy woman to change her wardrobe...I would, too, if I owned anything.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,You work in a team of women?  And your outfit is different...we don't really have uniforms, either.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself.  And has the finances to vary her outfit.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  That's rare on Mejare...you'd turn heads.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Is that common on Earth?  Few Mejarians are that way...
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Dark skin...besides Valore and Amarone, I'm not sure I know any Mejarian women like you.
4-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=thinking,Most Mejarians are pale, but your skin is dark.  So is Valore's...but that's beside the point.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...our outfits tend to vary, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...you've got some strange outfits yourselves.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides those bizarre outfits.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And dress herself in different ways.
4-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Did you get dressed up for this?  I know a few Mejarians that are obsessed with fashion...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Wha--<i>what are you doing</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't wave that thing around!

4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...With <i>magic</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  I guess <i>magic</i> would make you worthy of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=thinking,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  Well, she can't use <i>magic</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...but magic might give you a good reason to think that.

4-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  A year?  By what measure?  What are you talking about?
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus like this?  She's standing right here.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,I can't believe it took full exposure on my part to get you to finally lose.  I'm getting sloppy.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,Well, Jura, you've now humiliated me in two different ways...nudity and losing.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=interested,I'm pleasantly surprised to find my second-in-command dominating me like this.  Good job, Jura.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=interested,Excellent play, Jura.  Seems you're more than a match for me after all...
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=interested,<i>Two</i> Juras?  Well, you've certainly dolled yourself up to earn this.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=bored,I guess all that teasing really did the trick, Jura.  ~player~ loves you enough to put another one.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=unimpressed,Good.  Twice the vanity, half the responsibility.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=thinking,I don't make any effort to look beautiful, so I see why ~player~ would want two of you instead...
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...on most days.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=calm,Bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?  I hear you normally wear one.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.  But he always dresses the same, unlike you.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it...is this how people dress there?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating...even though you're not dressed for the part today.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,I suppose some sort of trinket is next?  That rapier was already on shaky ground, rule-wise.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,I've known you for too long.  There's no way you haven't prepared a whole host of small items to tease these people with.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased,I just rushed here in my flightsuit.  But you?  Plenty of jewelry to spare, I'm sure.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased,There's no doubt in my mind you've planned to make this quite the night for yourself.  What insubstantial decoration is first?
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,People say I never smile...are you the same way?
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...Of <i>space</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Who in space makes these decisions?
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I thought you were just out in space...
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too...how's it treating you?
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  Even with a whole crew at your side...
4-female_must_strip,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=impressed,You fly through space on an <i>observatory</i>?  Sounds...strangely luxurious.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...now we have a <i>goddess</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,You're doing it <i>again</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You were trapped...in a computer?  I guess we were trapped in the Paksis once...
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live in a...muh-more-puh-guh?
4-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is this "muh-more-puh-guh" how Earthlings pass the time?  You should be working.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...You can't be serious.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...<i>Excuse me</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...Can't you take this seriously?  Can't you <i>pretend</i> to do so?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,I--who are you?  How'd you get in here?
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
4-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,You just want attention...
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,I wanted a challenge, and I get <i>you</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...

4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,For God's sake...
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you report the news?  Mejare's news agencies are all state propaganda.
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,I'm not a fan of the media...my family has had some bad publicity on Mejare.
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're <i>reporting</i> this?  The last time I appeared on television, I was a little girl...
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I appeared on Mejarian television not too far back.  We were raiding an armory.
4-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see a woman who shares my fashion sense...though it looks like a tight fit.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type...though a rather unintimidating one.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  You <i>claim</i> to protect, but only when it suits you.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=bored,Oh, perfect.  A soldier.  Try not to kill anyone for fun before the game is over.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The ones I know enjoy indoctrinating children and shutting down housing districts.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you feast on men's energy, or something to that effect?  Way to confirm what Tarakkians already think.
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shapely.  Is that how a "succubus" lures men into her traps?
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=confused,Is all that really necessary?  And are those real wings?  I heard you say you were a <i>succubus</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=bored,You might actually give Jura some competition with that figure.  She's hunting for men herself...
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
4-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,Are you a student...?  I went to state schools on Mejare when I was a little girl...
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,Are you a student...?  How do men behave in school, anyway?
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.
4-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,Are you a student?  I dropped out of school...
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=confused,...Where's your body, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,You look like a miniature Paksis.  Any relation?
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like the Paksis sprouted wings and shrunk.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you big enough to hold the cards?
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
4-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Jura.  Always bragging about her looks...although she might be more justified in doing so.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
4-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,At least your <i>hair</i> is expressive.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=unimpressed,Taking another inch off of the stems?  Surely you can think of another way to waste our time.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,In case you were wondering, that's twice that you should've lost now.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=annoyed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=addressing,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,<i>Now</i> are you done?  Or are you going to summon vines and perpetuate this?
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Stripping your flowers now?  Any more vegetation we should know about?
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Is a bush next?  Are you stripping flowers and replacing them with branches?
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  With a brooch and everything...you look the part.
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  The crown leads me in that direction...
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  That's who rules Mejare...
4-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...the title doesn't make the woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You're from some kind of ninja village, was it?  And what's a ninja, for that matter?
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=impressed,These "ninjas" of yours sound a lot like the telepathic people Hibiki got stuck with...
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,Not to be rude, but what's the significance of your facial markings?
4-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=disappointed,Facial markings...I think Rabat's people have some, too.  Not that I trust them.
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly full of energy.  Might even rival Dita, though I could never picture her playing this.
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Wherever this <i>Australia</i> planet is, its food must be nutritious.  You're energetic.
4-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=pleased,You're pretty energetic.  That's good to see in a pilot, and I suppose Dita proves discipline isn't a necessity.
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
4-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,So you do unsavory work for this old woman you know?  I work for an old woman, too...she approached <i>me</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=bored,...Well, we know what your favorite color is, don't we?  Even your <i>hair</i> is purple...
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,Purple hair, purple outfit...even on Mejare, purple hair is a bit outlandish.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,I have some crewmates who wish their hair was a more exotic color, like your purple.  I suppose I should consider my blue strange...
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is that purple hair your natural color?  Where are you from?
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.  Though it seems your world has more nature...
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.  Seems you live in a world with vegetation...
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...feeling alright, Orendi?
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,We've never run into aliens in our travels...didn't think I'd meet one <i>here</i>.  And you're certainly alien.
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...<i>aware</i> of the rest of us?
4-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=bored,...Would you please stop shouting?  Whatever you are...
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is it true you're a "princess"?  I'm told you hold some authority...which makes me question why you're here.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,I'm told you're a ruler of some sort...shouldn't you be <i>ruling</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,I hear you're an authority figure where you're from.  I'm sure your subjects appreciate you spending your time like this.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,My experience with authority has always been that they don't deserve their power...you being here reinforces that.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little on edge.  It's just a card game.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's an interesting streak in your hair.  Mejarians have unusual hair colors, but not on specific parts...the red matches your attitude.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm told you spend a lot of time fighting woman authority figures.  Guess we're not so different...even if your demeanor is a bit acerbic.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That red streak seems to betray your attitude.  Just try to relax...
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
4-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...I thought <i>Marinette</i> was Ladybug.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,...So what you're saying is, Marinette made her public debut before Samus?
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  Sounds old...Marinette doesn't look old, especially not older than Samus.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus and Marinette like this?  I'm totally lost...
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--how could anyone be so--<i>are you serious</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,What a disgusting woman, offering so bluntly...wait, <i>you're letting her</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Unbelievable that someone could be so lecherous...wait, <i>what</i>?  Don't let her touch you!
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Wha--Jura, you don't even know this woman!  Don't let her near you!  Doesn't this place have rules about that?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Earth was devastated many years ago, so it started using its colonies as organ farms.  Mejare is the uterus colony...so there's no men.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=thinking,We've come to know a few men, actually...but Earth's organ-harvesting is why Mejare is nothing but women.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Mejare is just one of Earth's many colonies.  It was intentionally settled as women-only for Earth to harvest reproductive organs.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,Jura wanted to come here <i>because</i> we don't know much about men.  Earth harvests uteri from Mejare, so there's no need for them.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
4-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=thinking,Time travel...if it's true, I'm curious what you've actually used it for.  Unless you'd rather hide that...
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,This is how Jura treats <i>everyone</i>.  She's quite proud of herself...and to be fair, no disasters have struck because of her.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,I'll start reprimanding Jura when she starts getting women killed.  For now it's just an annoyance.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,I'm the squadron leader, yes, but Jura's second-in-command.  Besides, she hasn't gotten anyone killed yet...
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Jura's second-in-command.  She usually does her job...she just tends to get distracted with <i>this</i> sort of thing during downtime.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outfit that attracts men?  You'll have an easy time finding a man, then, Jura.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Talk to Jura about it...
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
4-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's this about wrestling?  ...Sounds like a male pursuit.  Physical posturing...
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off.  What <i>planet</i> are you from?
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,That's an...interesting skin color.  And speech pattern.  Who <i>are</i> you, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work as a <i>model</i>?  You and Jura here should talk.
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Isn't that you've always wanted, Jura?
4-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Seems Earth women are capable of being vain, too, Jura...and models.  Have fun with this girl.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm told you're into art.  If you want that life-sized portrait, Jura, here's your chance.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
4-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So does Jura here.  Fire away.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  This is your chance, Jura.  Make connections.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=confused,You're...<i>streaming</i> this?  I don't understand.
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you talking to?
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  Whatever, no one knows who I am anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  They might recognize me on Mejare, but not Earth...
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Guess I'm getting a <i>Wanted</i> mugshot tonight.
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't like publicity...not one bit.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  What do you think, Jura?  Was it for owning an anatomy book?
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...like us.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,The same person, both male and female...that shreds any doubts I had about men and women being the same species.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,I wonder what Hibiki would look like as a woman...probably taller, honestly.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Tarakkian scientists.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,The same person, one born on Mejare and the other on Tarak.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women, and I'm not sure which one is prettier.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?  ...Or without a body?
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,Jura's no fighter, but something tells me you and she would get along.  Two things, actually.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Don't call it luck, ~name~.  You were playing great.
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,This is a great game we have going.
4-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=happy,This is shaping up to be a nice match.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I just don't understand.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,You can't run away from your problems, Florina...I've tried.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,I appreciate women that stand their ground against their fears...
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,Running away doesn't solve anything...your fears can always run faster.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too?  Until recently we never got far past the Mejarian system.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,It took an accidental wormhole to actually fling us out of the Mejarian system.  <i>Your</i> Earth is a lot more adventurous.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Everyone on Earth, exploring space in peace and harmony?  This Star Fleet sounds nice.  Tarak and Mejare can't even unite the sexes.
4-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll agree that traveling through space teaches you a lot about other civilizations.  The colonies we've run into have all been different.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.  And you don't really have the wardrobe for this game...
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.

4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford that, if you wanted.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,Haven't you played cards before?  Aren't you wealthy enough to own a <i>casino</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though you've probably got more money than my whole crew.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  Even if it's only on finances.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Let me guess.  You're going to take off your underwear.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,I'm expecting a mundane display.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Here we go again...
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What are those sounds you keep making?  Is that the language of...whatever planet you come from?
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,I can barely understand you...verbally <i>and</i> physically.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's with your speech?  You keep making these odd sounds in places...
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Interesting skin color.  Are you even human?  Or an Earthling?
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare has strange hair colors...apparently Earth has strange <i>skin</i> colors.
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confused,I'm not sure what's more distracting: the skin color, or the wings.  Are you from Earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really thought this was Planet Earth.  I wasn't aware people here could be so...colorful.
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,Videl...you keep mentioning your "dad."  What's a dad?
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...what's a father?
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you're the type who clings to the past, ~player~.  That isn't healthy.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you aware there's a superior Velma character now, ~player~?  Don't cling to nostalgia like a fool.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and inform you there's a better Velma available for play now, ~player~.  This is Velma Classic.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=bored,Still using the inferior characters of the past, just because they're comfortable...listen, ~player~, the game has evolved.  So should you.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Velma Classic is just here for posterity, ~player~.  The Velma of today is far more on-model.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that...
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She's blind without her glasses, too...no mystery there.  But you solve those, yes?
4-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Are you any good with machines?  Or purely a mystery-solver?
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I won with <i>that</i>?  Poor show, ~name~...
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,I won with a <i>high card</i>...maybe I'll strip just to put myself at ease.
4-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Come on, I <i>deserved</i> that loss...
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,What's that phrase you keep saying?  "Plus Ultra"?  What does that mean?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,Why do you keep saying "Plus Ultra"?  Is that some sort of battle cry?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=calm,...What's the meaning of that "Plus Ultra" phrase you keep repeating?  Is it for teambuilding or just personal confidence?
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,You got to school with <i>men</i>?  Can't even imagine...
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,These "vampires" of yours sound like if the Harvest were even more supernatural than it already is.  Fearsome.
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,You work with computers?  I think Parfet's dabbled with them, though she likes machinery better.  Do they help with vampires?
4-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Tell me more about these "vampires."  If they exist, I'm sure Earth will send them our way soon enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You seem like you're getting nervous.  Is something wrong, Ochako?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,...Ochako, you're blushing.  A lot.  What's the matter?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=confused,...Aren't you just taking your belt off?  What's the matter?  You're beet red.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You're blushing, Ochako...and sweating, too.  Is something wrong?  Do you need help?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=confused,Let's make sure I understand this.  You go to a whole <i>school</i> of people with powers like yours?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2,marker:dropout=thinking,I actually dropped out of school as a girl...perhaps if that school was full of women with superpowers, I might have stayed.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I'm very curious about this "Academy" of yours.  And every student has powers like you do?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=thinking,School was never a pleasant experience for me...but then, I didn't have superpowers.  What's this Academy of yours like, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Good to see another woman who shares my fashion sense.  Even the color scheme is close...
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,My bodysuit is pretty standard among Mejarian styles...but looking at you, maybe it was inspired by Earth.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Bodysuits are comfortable, aren't they?  And efficient, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,That bodysuit of yours looks awfully similar to my own.  I don't think I could pull off that helmet, though.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,See what too much makeup leads to, Jura?  You shouldn't concern yourself with it.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,You should be very aware of when the enemy is closing in.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up on me <i>now</i>, Jura.  You had me in your sights.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,Don't let your target slip away, Jura...
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Feeling a little pinned down?  Surprisingly, I'm not.
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,Don't give up <i>now</i>, ~name~.
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=disappointed,Pull yourself together.  This isn't over.
4-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=calm,Pilots who call their victories luck can't handle their defeats.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't antagonize her, Jura.  I can respect a woman who understands the value of silence.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You could do to learn from me or her when it comes to occasionally being quiet.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You can't learn anything from talking, Jura.  Kyoko's being smart, listening in on us...
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,She <i>does</i> have my temperament.  Don't take that as an insult, Kyoko...more women should listen to others.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,That's quite the outfit.  You may have competition, Jura...but then, you like that.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Someone else with blue hair...too bad you're a soldier.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I can see two reasons why you and Jura are going to get along this evening.  And your martial arts skills aren't one of them.
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
4-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  Might even make <i>Jura</i> jealous.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
4-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=bored,...About as much on as <i>Barnette</i> ever layers.  And she has a certain reputation for baring it all.
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So, you're...some sort of "princess"?  Not sure I know what that is...
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So...does "princess" mean "light dresser"?  That would make more than a few of my crewmates princesses.
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,...Could you explain what a "princess" is?  I'm...not from Earth, so I don't know its titles.
4-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is a "princess" a position of power on Earth?  You'd think an authority figure would wear more clothing...
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm not sure I'd want to date someone who'd agree to it in a seedy place like this.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Unless she's heading to Mejare soon, I can't see that relationship working out.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You seem far more interested, Jura.  She <i>is</i> blonde, after all.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe <i>you</i> could flirt with her and bring her back.  Barnette could use some target practice.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe if she agreed to join the crew...but what from I hear, she <i>hunts</i> pirates.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,It's good to see a fellow pilot!  You even look a little like Belvedere.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing,I take the lead.  And there's not much left to before the finish line...you should wear shorts like these.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=pleased,As you can see, my underwear is more robust.  Makes sense it'd last longer.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing,Never thought my shorts comprised much of a defense, but it was enough to stave you off.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing,Had you worn a bra, you'd still be beating me.  As it stands, that thong doesn't do the trick.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Hunting space pirates?  Some pirates have a good reason for what they do...
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...And you hunt <i>space pirates</i>.  I see.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you travel through space, too...and hunt space pirates.  Good luck with that.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,There's a pirate named Rabat I wouldn't mind you catching for us...since you travel through space.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...and origin.
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree, Samus?  Even out in space...
4-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and you <i>hunt space pirates</i>?  I'll keep that in mind.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...look, Jura, another one.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You're a fiery one...she's how I picture your and Barnette's daughters, Jura.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of Jura here.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches <i>yours</i>, Jura.  Can't say the arm does, though.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You're a fiery one.  How'd you lose your arm?
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,What do you think, Jura?  Should we have our arms replaced with robotics?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Whatever this is, I'm sure it's banal.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,What are you talking about, Jura?
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,You've been keeping secrets this whole time?  That's not like you.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored,Oh, this'll be interesting, I'm sure.
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=confused,Are...you OK?  You're all clammed up...
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like a schoolgirl.  Are you sure you want to be here?  Is someone making you do this?
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you alright...Saki, was it?  You look so nervous...
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Saki?  That's you, right?  You've hardly said a thing...and you're turning red.
4-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've seen better days...and are about to see worse ones.  Are you sure you want to play this?
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.  And she doesn't really have the wardrobe for this game...
4-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  ...Apparently not with a "Borg collective."  I apologize.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...What's this "Borg" all about?
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Borg" sounds a lot like the Harvest...taking whatever they want.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,We used to think men were just a collective, too...maybe I shouldn't make fun.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Star Fleet" sounds nice.  Humans are all scattered on different planets where I'm from...though we don't have to deal with this "Borg."
4-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and the "Borg" sounds suspiciously similar to the Harvest.  We'll watch out for them.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> chilly, Jura.  At least I show my face.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Clearly I need to show less emotion, then.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You're right.  I could really improve my stoicism by watching her.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A <i>concession</i>?  I thought you were going to tease me all night.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I'm sure she has her reasons.  Stoicism is important for a leader...
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,...I'm sorry, you said you were a <i>genie</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly is a "genie"?
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Is "genie" some kind of Earth race?
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Amarone never calls herself a genie...
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Valore never called herself a genie...
4-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  B.C. never calls herself a genie...but then, she doesn't exactly count.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=impressed,You go to school for "magic"?  That...sounds rather fascinating, actually.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun...but I suppose magic would have made it easier.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't have good memories of school...maybe you could talk about your magic instead?
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm told you can use magic.  Sometimes the Paksis feels that way...we certainly never had any schooling on the subject.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's, and your sword like Jura's here.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.  But the sword is distinctly Jura.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, learn from this woman and actually use your sword properly.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,As long as you've got that sword, could you teach Jura how to use it?  That rapier of hers is just for show.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, take instructions from this woman so you can actually put that rapier to use.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I suppose.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Assuming that style exists anywhere, it's too conspicuous.  This coloration blends into machinery.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,She can be as bubbly as she wants.  I doubt she has the responsibilities you or I carry.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,She looks young, Jura...and in a better position.  She can afford to be happy, so let her.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wherever she comes from, I'm sure that pattern is optimal.  She must wear it for a reason.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...though you look like you're in a hurry to remove it.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=bored,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...but you seem quite comfortable yourself.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you're having fun already, even despite that strange green skin.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=bored,I was about to ask about your green skin, but it just seems to be your natural complexion.  You're certainly having fun as we speak.
4-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you smirking about all the time?  Just comfortable in your own...<i>green</i> skin?
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I don't think people will be confused.  This woman seems a lot more well-known on this planet.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,One letter can make all the difference...just like one mistake.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,If you actually got us confused, I'd have Duero check your eyes before you posed a danger to the team.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I trust my second-in-command to track the subtle differences between Mei and I.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Oh, good, another Meia.  Now I can take a day off of bossing Jura around.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Look at that, Jura.  The worst day of your life.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Playing with more than one of me is sweet.  Have you extended the same love to Jura here?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,I'm glad you like me enough to play with more than one of me, ~player~.  Do you like Jura, too?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  Rabat probably considers himself one.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  I can appreciate getting the job done quickly.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=bored,An assassin...there's nothing subtle about our Dreads, unfortunately.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,As assassin, you said?  One of the reasons I prefer Mejarian laser rigns is their subtlety.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Wha--<i>don't bring up Misty</i>!  It's not like she'll understand.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,You--I--Misty and I are not an <i>item</i>.  I just give her advice.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You know perfectly well Misty's into <i>men</i>, Jura...and also that she's too young.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Why do you try to twist my relationship with Misty into love?  She just...needs guidance.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,A "goddess"?  I'm sorry if I ever called you vain, Jura.  This is a new one.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You have some competition for extravagant dress, Jura.  And vanity, apparently.
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=awkward,Australians sure have a unique...manner of speaking.
4-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=disappointed,...How exactly did this "Australia" develop its dialect?
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I feel your pain.  I command a short, overconfident man myself.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,Well, this is <i>one</i> way to grow closer to your colleagues.  I sure wouldn't want any crewmates here.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Surely a <i>goddess</i> wouldn't need a man to help her.
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Amarone.
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Valore.
4-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
4-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,"Pearl"?  Jura's already a big fan of yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak...that's why its soldiers are so ruthless, even to us.
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman...but military service <i>isn't</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soldiers...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.
4-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'll try to reserve judgment...but know that it's a rare soldier that earns anything but my contempt.
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Are you...feeling OK?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You...<i>want</i> to strip?
4-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,I...who <i>are</i> you?
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're tall for a woman.  Might give Gascogne a run for her money.
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's this "America" planet known for?  Tall women?
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You report the news?  I was on the news as a little girl...wish I wasn't.
4-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're a reporter?  It's been a while since I had a <i>positive</i> media appearance.
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a..."princess"?  For nobility, you don't seem too informed...
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Then why are you here?
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She'd never lower herself to games like this...
4-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though I suppose you're lowering yourself by playing this.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
4-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue...I'm sure Parfet would like working with you, if you do engineering.
4-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=disappointed,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off...once she learns to pronounce "San Fransokyo."
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,What are you waving that thing around for?  Guns aren't children's playthings!
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,Put the gun down, would you?  What are you so afraid of?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...An acerbic, bestial woman waving a racketous mechanical gun around.  Just how I pictured Earth women.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,I can understand wanting to be armed in a seedy place like this, but you're taking this too far.  And don't wave it around!
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
4-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
4-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Sorry to be insulting, but you look rather unevenly-proportioned.  You should exercise more.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look you're giving everyone?  This is just a game.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,I'm trying not to comment on your body...Mejarians tend to be judgmental enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you seems off.  I'd suggest you relax.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...and you don't seem happy to be here.
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that...since you seem annoyed regardless.
4-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here...and you seem miserable about it, anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  You look like you're about to cast off that dress and go running.
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You seem more like a dressed-up athlete.
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She's certainly not as athletic as <i>you</i> look.
4-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though you might have an athletic edge on me.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,So, tell me about these "Phantom Thieves."  What is it you do?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Phantom Thieves" of yours sound like pirates.  What do you steal, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,Parfet is into computers.  You said you were, too, right?  Something about "Phantom Thieves"?
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, you're...a "clown"?  You shouldn't put yourself down like that...unless it's some kind of profession?
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly does a "clown" do for a living?  Are you some kind of public entertainer?
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, clowns...entertain people?  All the entertainment on Mejare tends to focus on the evils of men.
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard you were a "clown," which sounds a little degrading.  You don't seem too broken up about it, though.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  Quite decorated, as well.  Some type of authority, then?
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You're certainly dressed for it.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I have to ask...I don't know Earth's power structure.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...even if they dress that way.
4-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>Royalty</i>?  If you're the one ruling Earth, I suggest you stop sending the Harvest our way.
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=confused,"Dark Magician Girl"?  That's some sort of <i>title</i>, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't you have some sort of first name?  "Dark Magician Girl" is too long to say in the heat of battle.
4-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Dark Magician <i>Girl</i>?  Children aren't allowed here.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing...but just as unkempt.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She wears glasses, too...and she sometimes neglects hygiene.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together...and didn't teach her how to clean herself.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build..and Parfet's glasses.  Are you old enough to be here?  You should have cleaned yourself, regardless.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds...Parfet gets like that, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a lawyer.  I'm assuming that means you work with the law?  Mejare's laws are absolute.
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,You "practice law," correct?  Where I come from, laws are handed down...and no one can argue them.
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,What does a lawyer do, exactly?  Mejare doesn't allow women to argue the laws...if we could, men might be considered human.
4-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare doesn't allow legal arguments...and being a pirate, I'm on the wrong side of them.  But law is what you work with, correct?
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough...but magic sounds like a good motivator.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...but not about <i>magic</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're some kind of hunter, correct?  I suppose a pirate isn't far off from that.
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's this planet <i>Pandora</i> like?  More verdant than Mejare, I hope.
4-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  I think I knew a woman named Pandora once...
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we won't be here long.
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=confused,Are you counting each bandage as one layer?  If not, this'll be over soon.
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really wasn't counting on seeing nudity this quickly.  At least it's a woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Did I just walk in on a game that's nearly over?
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,You...what <i>are</i> you?  Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.  What <i>are</i> you, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...I hope you don't think the floating and lack of eyes is normal to us.  Or maybe it <i>is</i> on Earth...
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
4-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Congratulations, ~player~.  You've found what are probably my rarest lines.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  You must really like me, ~player~.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  Honestly, ~player~, that's a little flattering.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=pleased,I see Earth has also perfected cloning technology.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Glad you appreciate me enough to play with more than one of me.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  That's...a little cute, ~player~.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,More than one of me?  Considering my responsibilities, that would really help.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,Would you look at that, ~player~'s figured out the offline version.  And apparently is very fond of me.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,More than one Meia?  How flattering.  Be sure to try out Jura, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Never thought I'd say <i>these</i> lines.  I'm glad you like me so much, ~player~.  That's sweet.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,Do you have someone to support you?  This switching can't be good for your mental health...or physical.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=calm,Your blonde version seems liable to get you killed.  Do you have friends?  Colleagues?  Are you alright?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,I'd hate to see you wander around with your...condition.  Are you sure you're safe, always switching as you do?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=thinking,Earth women are full of surprises...do you want to live on the Nirvana, just to have some support?
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,You said you were a "Street Fighter," correct?  I suppose that <i>would</i> get you into shape.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,You said something about street fighting?  I've been in street fights.  I'd rather not go back to that, but if you like it...
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You said you're a street fighter?  That's a harsh life...I lived on the streets when I was younger.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,Street fighting isn't the kind of thing I'd glorify, but if it makes you happy...just take care of yourself.
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that headband some sort of designation?  Not to be rude.
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a "ninja"?  Sounds like the telepathic people Hibiki was stuck with.
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=bored,You're awfully quiet.  Not that I take issue with that...
4-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=confused,So these "ninjas" have their own society?  What separates you from a typical human?
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=pleased,Barnette's got green hair, too...but that's with the help of Mejarian genetic engineering.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=calm,Green hair isn't that strange on Mejare.  One of my pilots has it.  What about Earth?
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=impressed,Is your hair naturally green?  That'd be impressive for an Earth woman...
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
4-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.  Of course, Mejare's schools tried to do the same.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
4-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...at least the rest seems comfrotable for you.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.  The rest of our styles match, at least.
4-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_spiders=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=calm,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,...What in Ma's name am I looking at?  Are you <i>human</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I'll be perfectly honest.  You look inhuman.
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,Er...what <i>are</i> you, exactly?
4-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I thought the <i>Harvest</i> was terrifying.  My God.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type, based on those weapons.  Guess you can't trust a soldier to leave them behind, even here.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got a sweet expression for all those weapons you're carrying.  It's unsettling.
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you brought weapons here?  What kind of place is this?
4-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You're a military woman?  You've got the uncomfortably sweet expression of one, for sure.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Bless you--oh, <i>no</i>.  Don't tell me...
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Not <i>this</i> again.  The blonde version?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,God bless you--oh, damn it.  She's changed back...
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Bless--damn it, that was Launch.  Here we go again...
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,Someone said you gave up on school.  So did I...
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like you get a lot of exercise.  Always good to see in a woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=disappointed,You said something about a <i>killer</i>?  Earth's no stranger to killing, as far as I'm concerned.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  Duero seems that way, too, even if he only shows it to Parfet.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Take that how you will.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Besides Duero, I can't picture a man sitting still.
4-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=thinking,You're into art, you said?  Artists are good to have around...they tend not to kill people.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
4-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,Good, you're wearing enough makeup for both of us.  Saves me the trouble.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
4-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,You look like you're in great shape.  I respect that in a woman...very much.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Not to be too forward, but...your legs are so muscular.  What's your training routine?
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Wow...whatever you do to exercise, I'd like to learn it.  You look fantastic.
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman, and in a good way.  Could I get your frame with enough training?
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Your build is impressive...and I wouldn't say to that to <i>any</i> strange woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'm told you hold some authority in a military organization.  I hope you're using that responsibly.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,A military woman?  Excuse me for not being impressed.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You don't seem quite as fiercely repulsive as the woman soldiers I've come to know.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,Military...nothing worse than having a soldier around.  Try not to kill anyone.
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,You raid tombs?  All of Earth is ancient history is Mejare, not just dead queens.
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you certainly look fit, which is good to see in a woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,<i>Tombs</i>, you said?  Not for me...too cramped.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...but the mechanical arm is more striking.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a fiery one.  I'm sorry about your arm...or I <i>would</i> be, if it didn't look superior to my own.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=addressing,I shouldn't pry as to how you lost your arm...but is that mechanical replacement useful?
4-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,You're a fiery one.  Like if Barnette and Jura had their child...hopefully she'd have her arm.
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,What was that transformation you did earlier?  That was impressive...you had a full suit on!
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Didn't you come here with a pink suit on?  How'd you take it off so quickly?  All I saw was light...
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,Did you...<i>transform</i> earlier?  What was that all about?  I'm curious...
4-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Weren't you wearing a suit like mine just before?  ...Besides the pink.  How did you transform out of it?
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
4-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager...and your dress doesn't seem too protective.
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...are Earth women realy like this?
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=bored,You seem to know us all pretty well...perhaps a little <i>too</i> well, if you follow.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.
4-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,"Black Canary"?  I <i>wish</i> Mejare had canaries...
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,Not to be rude, but I still can't comprehend this.  Are you shaving...<i>the rest of it</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,...Is the bottom fur next?  Did you really come here naked?
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,To meet a cat-woman hybrid here, and that she's not even wearing anything...I assume what's around your groin is fur, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,You've only lost once before, but I think I know what's coming next.  If it, too, is fur...
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=impressed,Even for an Earth woman, that looks like pretty old-fashioned dress.  Your manners are similarly classical...
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,I could have sworn I saw you at another table than this one...guess it must have been a similarly passive woman.
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=confused,How'd you lose that bit of your finger?  You seem rather demure to be in combat...
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem very assertive.  I wouldn't think this game would attract a shy woman like you...
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that a camera?  Paiway, our child nurse, is always skulking around with hers...so this is nothing new.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=bored,A camera?  Are you really going to photograph us all?  ...Whatever.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you trying to blackmail us with that camera?  I've been in the media for far worse than this.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hope you don't think you're going to embarrass me with that camera.  I'm not exactly from here, anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons...or another dress, at least.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Mejare has detectives...but they mostly investigate enemies of the state.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Anyone who focuses on discovering secrets is probably hiding a few themselves.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  Are men any good in school?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  More nuanced than Mejare's, I hope.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem about as expressive as <i>I</i> ever get.
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,They said you're a student...but something about you seems intense.  Like you know more than you let on...
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a student.  The uniform matches...but something in your eyes doesn't.
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I know this is rude, but...something seems off about you.  What did you say you did?  You're a student?
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,For a supposed student, there's something about the way you carry yourself that makes me wary...like you're one step ahead of us.
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,This "magic" of yours sounds pretty interesting.  Can it be taught?
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're immortal.  Is that in the sense of never aging, or never dying at all?
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,If you really <i>can</i> wield magic, I'd be honored to learn it...it sounds useful.
4-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=calm,The Paksis has proven to me that powers beyond human ability exist...so I'm willing to believe you might have some.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're aware you need <i>clothing</i> to play this game, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=confused,Did you just come here from a finished game?  You've got almost nothing on...
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=impressed,And they say <i>Mejarians</i> dress revealingly.  You barely dress at <i>all</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you meant to come dressed in a cat costume, it seems to be missing a few pieces.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I was told you were a spacefarer, as well...and a pilot.  Good to see a woman who understands my situation.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Is it true you're a space pilot?  So am I...I'd love to discuss formations or maneuvers after the game is over.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're a pilot.  I never expected to meet a woman like that here...what's your ship like?
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I heard you're a space pilot.  I command a Dread squadron myself...what is it that you do?
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone told me you're a space pilot.  I've really fallen in love with piloting myself, though I only have a few years' experience...
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why is your skin pink?  Do you have a medical condition?  Earth is no stranger to poisoning populations it doesn't care for...
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...and you look a little sickly with that skin.  Were you poisoned?  Did Earth do this to you?
4-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you alright?  Your skin...it's pink, and it looks unhealthy.  I wouldn't put it past Earth to do this to undesirables...
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...who's the Oma going to be?
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=impressed,Someone said you're with a woman...have the two of you gotten pregnant yet?
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I guess.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
4-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,I'm told you were cryogenically frozen for some time...that's also true of Misty, a young girl I know from Pluto.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,Is it true you were in cryosleep for a number of years?  So was a man I know...he looks younger than me, but he's over a hundred years old.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,Someone mentioned you were in cryosleep for some time.  It sounds uncomfortable...maybe you don't want to talk about it.
4-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,You were cryogenically frozen, correct?  Several of my crewmates were, as well...technically making them older than any of us.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You said you come from the plains?  Sounds nice...Mejare's not very verdant, and Tarak's even worse.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You come from the plains, you said?  My parents took me to the plains when I was a little girl...it was fun to run around.
4-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,The plains, you said you lived in?  Somehow I doubt the Earth I know has any green left...
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
4-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
4-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=impressed,These "Evas" I've heard of actually seem like impressive technology.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You said something about "Evas" before?  My Dread sounds a lot more reliable...but still, they sound fearsome.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Evas" sound like they're not to be trifled with.  Good thing the Earth I know doesn't have any.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.  Although it would seem your outfit is branching out.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=calm,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...say, you look a little different than before.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And is it just me, or did you dress up for this?
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides the outfits.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about your outfit seems unusual for you...strange, since I've never met you before.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
4-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...pure black is an interesting choice, if it's intentional.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...I don't think I know anyone with pure black hair.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  That black hair is imposing...as is your stark outfit.
4-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though no pilot of mine has pure black hair.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
4-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're some kind of covert agent?  I'd be lying if I said I was good at sniffing those out.
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,Speaking of covert agents...I think we gave B.C. a newfound respect for women.
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,The Nirvana's had its share of covert agents.  They tend to warm up to our cause.
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=impressed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  I suppose the Paksis isn't all that different...
4-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  We've had our issues with hostile red light in the past.
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.  What do you use this magic for?
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?  I'd like to see some...
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset...in battle and out.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=addressing,If you could teach your "magic" to me, this night might actually be worth it.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=confused,You're...a little thin on clothes to be playing this, don't you think?
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  You've barely got anything on.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've heard of Valentine's Day...but that's for love, not indecency.
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=bored,Shouldn't you have come to a strip poker game...<i>clothed</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=pleased,That's about how much Barnette wears with her apron.
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is it true you're a "mutant"?  Forgive my ignorance, but you look quite human to me.
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=awkward,For a supposed mutant, you look very human.  Maybe it's an Earth custom I'm missing...
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,I was told you're a mutant.  Considering your very human appearance, I think that warrants an explanation.
4-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,Would you mind explaining what they meant when they said you're a "mutant"?  Is that just a term for some subset of Earthlings?
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm a pirate, too...small universe we live in.
4-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  Well...the outfit is certainly different, and apparently the manner.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
4-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like Paiway dressed up as a fairy.  Are you old enough to be here?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I read about fairies as a girl.  They protected Mejarian children from marauding packs of men.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,A <i>fairy</i>?  Earth never fails to surprise me with its species variety.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a fairy?  I'd need to see something spectacular for you to match the stories I've heard.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches Jura's.  So does your intensity.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,You're a fiery one...like if Barnette and Jura had their child, finally.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of some of my crewmates.
4-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.

-3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Mind drifting elsewhere, ~player~?

-3-male_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,My impression of men is that you can tell them what to smash, but don't expect them to dream it up themselves.

-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,I can respect having the courage to come alone.  Jura's the only reason I came here at all...
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=disappointed,Can't say I'm thrilled about a man playing at all, but at least he didn't bring friends.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-jura:1,count-corrin_f:1=bored,Jura dragging me here at all isn't what I'd call supportive, Rinkah.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,You're doing great, ~player~.  That was an excellent streak...
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Quite a streak.  Don't go easy on me now...
-3-male_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Come on, don't give up on me now...
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  You're too much.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,Even with a <i>high card</i>, a man finds a way to lose to me.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Talk about bad strategy.
-3-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,I had a <i>high card</i>.  At this point <i>Hibiki</i> could outplay you...
-3-male_must_strip=addressing,I hear men hate losing...well, so do I.

-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,Never thought I'd meet a <i>man</i> with my fashion sense.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you were frozen for decades.  Hibiki was that way, too...
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Hibiki could certainly benefit from that...not that he'd ever accept.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you used be small and weak, but were scientifically altered.  Seems unbecoming of a man to take the easy way out.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,If everyone on this <i>America</i> planet is built like you, I'd hate to see the women.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you really a captain?  You seem built more to <i>take</i> orders than give them.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't need to strip for me to tell you're fit.  They'd worship you on Tarak.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=pleased,I never thought I'd meet a man shorter than Hibiki...but you might be the one.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who let this...<i>child</i> in here?
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Men really do come in all shapes and sizes.  You might as well be a woman.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you?  You look like a child.  Get out.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=bored,I'm no expert on men, but you look like a prepubescent one...never mind the cat ears.  Children aren't allowed here.
-3-male_must_strip,target:caleb,targetStage:0=awkward,We shouldn't be playing with this child here.  This is wrong...
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,And I thought <i>Hibiki</i> was outgoing...
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,Well...you're certainly enthusiastic.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=impressed,We're all right here.  You don't have to shout.
-3-male_must_strip,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is "captain" an actual designation, or just what you call yourself?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard there's a female version of you.  What kept <i>her</i> away?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,And I thought <i>Bart's</i> outfits could be garish.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress more garishly than Bart.  I wonder how <i>you'd</i> look bald.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really, ~player~?  You picked <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Really?  Over 100 characters and you pick <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've <i>seen</i> men.  You're Kool-Aid <i>monster</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,...Have some respect for yourself, ~player~.  <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Unless it's April Fool's Day, you shouldn't be picking this character.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=unimpressed,If this is what Earthlings find attractive, I'm glad the colonists left.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,I'm not sure how to feel about being picked by the same player who'd choose <i>Kool-Aid Man</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kool-aid,targetStage:0=bored,You must really hate me to stick me on a table with <i>this</i> idiot, ~player~.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Can't you take this seriously, ~player~?
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,~player~, you're better than this.  Pick a real character.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,You put <i>Shaggy Blanco</i> on a table with me?  Do you really hate me that much?
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I wish I could understand what you're saying.  Maybe then I'd get something out of this joke.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=bored,At least you started working out.  You're still all unkempt.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=disappointed,White's not a popular color among Mejarians...you can imagine why.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=annoyed,Not sure how to take this.  You picked <i>me</i>...but apparently I'm only worthy of playing with Shaggy Blanco.
-3-male_must_strip,target:el_shaggy_blanco,targetStage:0=addressing,Thought I wouldn't have lines to a joke character?  You underestimate me, ~player~.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Now</i> are you taking off that ridiculous blindfold?  Or...<i>tactical visor</i>.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,So are you forfeiting, or are you finally deciding to let yourself see?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Attached to that blindfold?  Either give up the game or take off that thing...your move.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,What is this "Pod" you keep referring to?  What does it do?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Are you going to explain what your "Pod" is, or are we all supposed to ignore it?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll bite.  What's this "Pod" you keep mentioning?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm curious about this "Pod" of yours.  I suppose you wanted me to ask about that, since you said it out loud.
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=impressed,You're...a <i>man</i>?  Not like one I've ever seen.
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you speaking through a translator?  Is that some archaic Earth language?
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Earth languages besides the common tongue are a mystery to me.  Even Tarakkian code is not something I've ever concerned myself with.
-3-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Facial markings?  Like Rabat's people.  I'll keep that in mind, Earth-man.
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
-3-male_must_strip,target:fred,targetStage:0=calm,You might be handsomer if you grew your hair out.  Duero makes it work.
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,So, you help that girl fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
-3-male_must_strip,target:xander,targetStage:0=calm,You seem immature...but then, Hibiki makes that work for himself.
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  You're too much...
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,Even with a <i>high card</i>, a man finds a way to lose to me...
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Talk about bad strategy...
-3-male_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I had a <i>high card</i>.  At this point <i>Hibiki</i> could outplay you.
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,...I've seen enough men to know you're not human.
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly...<i>are</i> you?
-3-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=disappointed,So <i>gay</i> is the term Earthlings use?  Sounds sort of derisive.
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Maybe I just lack the experience, but...are you a man or a woman?
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=confused,Men and women have always looked pretty distinct to me...and then there's you.
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you live underground?  Sounds claustrophobic...
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,You were created in a lab?  So was I, technically...
-3-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=thinking,So, you were made in a lab...like every woman on Mejare, and every man on Tarak.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=impressed,Wait, you two work together?  That's...very awkward.  Jura and I split up when we came here...
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,I see even on Earth, the superiority of women is clearly entrenched.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  The captain is quite a bit older than I am...
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=pleased,You take orders from this woman?  I sure wouldn't want <i>Hibiki</i> playing this with me.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=disappointed,So you <i>can</i> speak.  What was that all about?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=annoyed,So you <i>were</i> just making fun of me...
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=bored,Grunting and screaming around women is what I'd expect from a Tarakkian.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll be honest.  You don't look like much of a man.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought men were supposed to be tall and strong.  Of course, Hibiki proves <i>that</i> wrong...
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why do you have wings?  I <i>thought</i> men were human, but maybe not.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,Children aren't allowed in here, even male ones.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why are you blindfolded?  Don't you want to see the cards?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Why are you wearing a blindfold?  Are you really that confident?
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you on a bet or something?  Take your blindfold off and play seriously.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=confused,Your outfit is one thing, but to be wearing a blindfold?  What's wrong with you?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't trust you.  You have a nasty look in your eye.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I've always regarded men as simple...but you look a little <i>too</i> complex.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=annoyed,I've learned that men aren't really animals...but something about you reminds me of one.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look unhinged.  Always thought men were, but never saw one display it...
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you staring at?  Look somewhere else.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Judging by his attitude, men are a lot more shy about nudity...which only makes this more curious.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=awkward,You two must be close, then.  Good to know men and women can be this comfortable around each other...I suppose.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,It's definitely a unique coincidence.  But being nude together is no issue for us...I wonder if that's true for these two.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-jura:1=disappointed,Jura and I shower together, since the ship only has the communal bathroom...is that true for you two, as well?
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,You're doing great, ~name~.  That was an excellent streak.
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,Quite a streak.  Don't go easy on me now.
-3-male_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Come on, don't give up on me now.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,A "Street Fighter"...I've been in street fights.  Nothing to brag about.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Eternal Fighting Champion"?  You shouldn't rest on your laurels.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryu,targetStage:0=impressed,I came to see a man here...you're certainly a lot of man.
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,Do they not have poker where you come from?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Mind drifting elsewhere, ~name~?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Can't keep your eyes on the cards, ~name~?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,My back's against the wall.  Can't finish me off?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You don't feel bad for me like this, do you?
-3-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=smug,My impression of men is that you can tell them what to smash, but don't expect them to dream it up themselves.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...That's a man, Jura.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I'm no expert, but I think Corrin is a <i>man</i>, actually.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...I think Corrin's a man, Jura.  Though he <i>does</i> look feminine.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Maybe you could talk to Jura...if you seemed capable of talking.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  Duero's the only man I know who's smart enough for that.
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery...
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>You</i> solve mysteries?  You look like you can barely get yourself out of bed.
-3-male_must_strip,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Man or woman, unkempt appearances don't impress me.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hear you're good with a sword.  Jura, do you think you could learn from this man?  Perhaps nonverbally?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I see you value words about as much as I do.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is this some primitive men's language?
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't seem too talkative, but I'm told you can handle a sword.  You could stand to learn something from this man, Jura.
-3-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Barely talks, skilled with a sword?  Look at that, Jura.  He's everything you're not.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=impressed,You're awfully forward with men.  I guess you have experience with them.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You seem to really want men to strip.  I'm not sure I want to see what's lurking beneath.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,You're about how I would expect an Earth woman to treat men.  I don't see what the big deal is.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1=disappointed,Hairy and angular.  I don't really see a man's appeal, but it's quite clear to you, apparently.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,They told me you're an agent, but an agent of <i>what</i>, I'm still not sure.  Perhaps you could elaborate...and take off your weapon.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=angry,Don't think I don't see that weapon.  I'm trying to be less wary of men...but an armed "agent" puts me on edge.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's my understanding you're an agent.  Well, I'm a pirate...and I didn't come armed, so perhaps you should remove your weapon.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0=bored,An "agent" of a man with a weapon at his hip is making this an uncomfortable experience already.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,The same person, both male and female...guess that cements it.  Men and women <i>are</i> the same species.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=thinking,I wonder what <i>I'd</i> look like as a man...horrifying.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Mejarian scientists.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=pleased,The same person, one born on Tarak and the other on Mejare.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women.
-3-female_human_must_strip=interested,Ah...I've staved off defeat.
-3-female_human_must_strip=addressing,This is me playing seriously...
-3-female_human_must_strip=addressing,Thought you could brush me aside, did you?
-3-female_human_must_strip=smug,I'm under more stress than this every day...
-3-female_human_must_strip=pleased,This is nothing next to managing a fleet of excitable young women.
-3-female_human_must_strip=pleased,You know, Jura's not half bad at this...but she never applies herself.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  You're too much.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,Even with a <i>high card</i>, she finds a way to lose to me.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Talk about bad strategy.
-3-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I had a <i>high card</i>.  At this point <i>Dita</i> could outplay you.
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,That's the way, ~player~...you were winning for a while there.
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Bad time for your streak to disappear...
-3-female_human_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,I was worried for a moment there...
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,A woman can't afford to choke at the very end, ~player~...
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Poor showing, with your opponent nearly defeated...
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Try not to beat yourself, ~player~...
-3-female_human_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You've nearly beaten me...so try not to beat yourself.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Ah...I've staved off defeat.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,This is me playing seriously...
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Thought you could brush me aside, did you?
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,I'm under more stress than this every day...
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,This is nothing next to managing a fleet of excitable young women.
-3-female_must_strip=interested,Ah, and I've staved off defeat.
-3-female_must_strip=interested,This is me playing seriously.
-3-female_must_strip=addressing,Thought you could brush me aside, did you?
-3-female_must_strip=smug,I'm under more stress than this every day.
-3-female_must_strip=pleased,This is nothing next to managing a fleet of excitable young women.
-3-female_must_strip=pleased,You know, Jura's not half bad at this.  But she never applies herself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Assuming that style exists anywhere, it's too conspicuous.  This coloration blends into machinery.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,She can be as bubbly as she wants.  I doubt she has the responsibilities you or I carry.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,She looks young, Jura...and in a better position.  She can afford to be happy, so let her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wherever she comes from, I'm sure that pattern is optimal.  She must wear it for a reason.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,See what too much makeup leads to, Jura?  You shouldn't concern yourself with it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I don't think people will be confused.  This woman seems a lot more well-known on this planet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,One letter can make all the difference...just like one mistake.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,If you actually got us confused, I'd have Duero check your eyes before you posed a danger to the team.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I trust my second-in-command to track the subtle differences between Mei and I.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,Not to be rude, but I still can't comprehend this.  Are you shaving...<i>the rest of it</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,...Is the bottom fur next?  Did you really come here naked?
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=impressed,To meet a cat-woman hybrid here, and that she's not even wearing anything...I assume what's around your groin is fur, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:1=awkward,You've only lost once before, but I think I know what's coming next.  If it, too, is fur...
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,I'm told you were cryogenically frozen for some time...that's also true of Misty, a young girl I know from Pluto.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=calm,Is it true you were in cryosleep for a number of years?  So was a man I know...he looks younger than me, but he's over a hundred years old.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,Someone mentioned you were in cryosleep for some time.  It sounds uncomfortable...maybe you don't want to talk about it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,You were cryogenically frozen, correct?  Several of my crewmates were, as well...technically making them older than any of us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,Funny.  The "netherrealm" is pretty much how Mejare sees Tarak...that's why its soldiers are so ruthless, even to us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=impressed,You've got a lot of fight in you.  Always good to see in a woman...but military service <i>isn't</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=disappointed,I'm a little wary of soldiers...Mejare's government isn't too keen on us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sonya,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'll try to reserve judgment...but know that it's a rare soldier that earns anything but my contempt.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...but the mechanical arm is more striking.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a fiery one.  I'm sorry about your arm...or I <i>would</i> be, if it didn't look superior to my own.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=addressing,I shouldn't pry as to how you lost your arm...but is that mechanical replacement useful?
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,You're a fiery one.  Like if Barnette and Jura had their child...hopefully she'd have her arm.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Oh, good, another Meia.  Now I can take a day off of bossing Jura around.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Look at that, Jura.  The worst day of your life.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Playing with more than one of me is sweet.  Have you extended the same love to Jura here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,I'm glad you like me enough to play with more than one of me, ~player~.  Do you like Jura, too?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  Rabat probably considers himself one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're an assassin?  I can appreciate getting the job done quickly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=bored,An assassin...there's nothing subtle about our Dreads, unfortunately.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=disappointed,As assassin, you said?  One of the reasons I prefer Mejarian laser rigns is their subtlety.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What are those sounds you keep making?  Is that the language of...whatever planet you come from?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,I can barely understand you...verbally <i>and</i> physically.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's with your speech?  You keep making these odd sounds in places...
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...who's the Oma going to be?
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=impressed,Someone said you're with a woman...have the two of you gotten pregnant yet?
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I guess.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I guess.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're with a woman...Rebekah and Ezra recently had their baby.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=pleased,Someone said you're with a woman...Jura and Barnette sure get along.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=disappointed,Someone said you're with a woman...I guess Mejare got its inspiration from some Earth women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,Someone said you're with a woman...I should see if Valore is taken.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,The same person, both male and female...that shreds any doubts I had about men and women being the same species.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,I wonder what Hibiki would look like as a woman...probably taller, honestly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=disappointed,Male and female...you two would make perfect test subjects for Tarakkian scientists.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=pleased,The same person, one born on Mejare and the other on Tarak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=impressed,I'll be honest...you <i>both</i> look like women, and I'm not sure which one is prettier.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is it true you're a "mutant"?  Forgive my ignorance, but you look quite human to me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=awkward,For a supposed mutant, you look very human.  Maybe it's an Earth custom I'm missing...
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,I was told you're a mutant.  Considering your very human appearance, I think that warrants an explanation.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=disappointed,Would you mind explaining what they meant when they said you're a "mutant"?  Is that just a term for some subset of Earthlings?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like Paiway dressed up as a fairy.  Are you old enough to be here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I read about fairies as a girl.  They protected Mejarian children from marauding packs of men.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,A <i>fairy</i>?  Earth never fails to surprise me with its species variety.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a fairy?  I'd need to see something spectacular for you to match the stories I've heard.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Let me guess.  You're going to take off your underwear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,I'm expecting a mundane display.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Here we go again...
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're some kind of covert agent?  I'd be lying if I said I was good at sniffing those out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,Speaking of covert agents...I think we gave B.C. a newfound respect for women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=pleased,The Nirvana's had its share of covert agents.  They tend to warm up to our cause.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=impressed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  I suppose the Paksis isn't all that different...
-3-female_must_strip,target:lux,targetStage:0=disappointed,You fight with <i>light</i>?  We've had our issues with hostile red light in the past.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't antagonize her, Jura.  I can respect a woman who understands the value of silence.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You could do to learn from me or her when it comes to occasionally being quiet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You can't learn anything from talking, Jura.  Kyoko's being smart, listening in on us...
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,She <i>does</i> have my temperament.  Don't take that as an insult, Kyoko...more women should listen to others.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches Jura's.  So does your intensity.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=pleased,You're a fiery one...like if Barnette and Jura had their child, finally.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of some of my crewmates.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=impressed,You go to school for "magic"?  That...sounds rather fascinating, actually.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Life on the streets isn't fun...but I suppose magic would have made it easier.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't have good memories of school...maybe you could talk about your magic instead?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm told you can use magic.  Sometimes the Paksis feels that way...we certainly never had any schooling on the subject.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=impressed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  I'm...so sorry.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.  What do you use this magic for?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?  I'd like to see some...
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=impressed,Can this "magic" be taught?  It sounds like a useful asset...in battle and out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=addressing,If you could teach your "magic" to me, this night might actually be worth it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford that, if you wanted.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=disappointed,Haven't you played cards before?  Aren't you wealthy enough to own a <i>casino</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though you've probably got more money than my whole crew.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  Even if it's only on finances.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,What was that transformation you did earlier?  That was impressive...you had a full suit on!
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=confused,Didn't you come here with a pink suit on?  How'd you take it off so quickly?  All I saw was light...
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=impressed,Did you...<i>transform</i> earlier?  What was that all about?  I'm curious...
-3-female_must_strip,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Weren't you wearing a suit like mine just before?  ...Besides the pink.  How did you transform out of it?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...though you look like you're in a hurry to remove it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=bored,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...but you seem quite comfortable yourself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you're having fun already, even despite that strange green skin.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=bored,I was about to ask about your green skin, but it just seems to be your natural complexion.  You're certainly having fun as we speak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shego,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are you smirking about all the time?  Just comfortable in your own...<i>green</i> skin?
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>ghost</i>?  Now I've seen everything...
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,I was under the impression all my opponents would be alive.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=impressed,The Paksis creates apparitions sometimes...I don't know how <i>you're</i> here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=confused,How can you see the cards with no eyes?  ...Or without a body?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some private lessons...or another dress, at least.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Mejare has detectives...but they mostly investigate enemies of the state.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a detective?  Anyone who focuses on discovering secrets is probably hiding a few themselves.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  Are men any good in school?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,This <i>academy</i> of yours sounds like a school.  More nuanced than Mejare's, I hope.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem about as expressive as <i>I</i> ever get.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, take instructions from this woman so you can actually put that rapier to use.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Any reason you came armed to a friendly card game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,Feel free to put the gun down anytime.  This is a <i>card game</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Amarone, I suppose.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...there's Valore, I suppose.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0=disappointed,The way you're clutching that gun tells me you and Barnette would hit it off.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheva,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're aware you need <i>clothing</i> to play this game, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=confused,Did you just come here from a finished game?  You've got almost nothing on...
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=impressed,And they say <i>Mejarians</i> dress revealingly.  You barely dress at <i>all</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you meant to come dressed in a cat costume, it seems to be missing a few pieces.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You dress just like Dita, with that exposed midriff.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=disappointed,You <i>save the world</i>?  ...Alright then.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=bored,You <i>save the world</i>?  Earth doesn't need saving, as far as I'm concerned.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Fancy dress...your outfit is like Ezra's, and your sword like Jura's here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You dress like Ezra...you kind of look like her, too.  But the sword is distinctly Jura.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Jura, learn from this woman and actually use your sword properly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,As long as you've got that sword, could you teach Jura how to use it?  That rapier of hers is just for show.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,You raid tombs?  All of Earth is ancient history is Mejare, not just dead queens.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you certainly look fit, which is good to see in a woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lara,targetStage:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,<i>Tombs</i>, you said?  Not for me...too cramped.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're some kind of hunter, correct?  I suppose a pirate isn't far off from that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's this planet <i>Pandora</i> like?  More verdant than Mejare, I hope.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lilith,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet <i>Pandora</i>, was it?  I think I knew a woman named Pandora once...
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  Quite decorated, as well.  Some type of authority, then?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You're certainly dressed for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  I have to ask...I don't know Earth's power structure.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...even if they dress that way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zelda,targetStage:0=annoyed,<i>Royalty</i>?  If you're the one ruling Earth, I suggest you stop sending the Harvest our way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Britain like?  Never heard of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...besides that glowing device on your chest.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=impressed,That thing lets you <i>go back in time</i>?  Well, I hope you're a good sport.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tracer,targetStage:0=thinking,Time travel...if it's true, I'm curious what you've actually used it for.  Unless you'd rather hide that...
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,What's that phrase you keep saying?  "Plus Ultra"?  What does that mean?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=confused,Why do you keep saying "Plus Ultra"?  Is that some sort of battle cry?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:6=calm,...What's the meaning of that "Plus Ultra" phrase you keep repeating?  Is it for teambuilding or just personal confidence?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Earth was devastated many years ago, so it started using its colonies as organ farms.  Mejare is the uterus colony...so there's no men.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=thinking,We've come to know a few men, actually...but Earth's organ-harvesting is why Mejare is nothing but women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Mejare is just one of Earth's many colonies.  It was intentionally settled as women-only for Earth to harvest reproductive organs.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,Jura wanted to come here <i>because</i> we don't know much about men.  Earth harvests uteri from Mejare, so there's no need for them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type, based on those weapons.  Guess you can't trust a soldier to leave them behind, even here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got a sweet expression for all those weapons you're carrying.  It's unsettling.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you brought weapons here?  What kind of place is this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:hope,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You're a military woman?  You've got the uncomfortably sweet expression of one, for sure.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Bless you--oh, <i>no</i>.  Don't tell me...
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Not <i>this</i> again.  The blonde version?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,God bless you--oh, damn it.  She's changed back...
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,Bless--damn it, that was Launch.  Here we go again...
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--how could anyone be so--<i>are you serious</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=surprised-horny,What a disgusting woman, offering so bluntly...wait, <i>you're letting her</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Unbelievable that someone could be so lecherous...wait, <i>what</i>?  Don't let her touch you!
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Wha--Jura, you don't even know this woman!  Don't let her near you!  Doesn't this place have rules about that?
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...sort of.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable...although you seem quite comfortable in yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Hard to take someone seriously when they won't show their face...at least the rest seems comfrotable for you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_style=disappointed,I always appreciate being able to look a woman in the eye.  The rest of our styles match, at least.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0,marker:gwen_spiders=bored,Mejare doesn't have many animals...and I <i>wish</i> it didn't have spiders.
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off.  What <i>planet</i> are you from?
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0,marker:mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You...said something about ponies?  I've seen pictures of ponies, but there are none on Mejare.
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I can have a tough time reading people...but I'm not sure you're even a person.
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=confused,That's an...interesting skin color.  And speech pattern.  Who <i>are</i> you, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You seem like you're getting nervous.  Is something wrong, Ochako?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,...Ochako, you're blushing.  A lot.  What's the matter?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=confused,...Aren't you just taking your belt off?  What's the matter?  You're beet red.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=calm,You're blushing, Ochako...and sweating, too.  Is something wrong?  Do you need help?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=calm,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=disappointed,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I just don't understand.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,You can't run away from your problems, Florina...I've tried.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,I appreciate women that stand their ground against their fears...
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=bored,Running away doesn't solve anything...your fears can always run faster.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that headband some sort of designation?  Not to be rude.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a "ninja"?  Sounds like the telepathic people Hibiki was stuck with.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=bored,You're awfully quiet.  Not that I take issue with that...
-3-female_must_strip,target:hinata,targetStage:0=confused,So these "ninjas" have their own society?  What separates you from a typical human?
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=pleased,You look like Paiway's first attempt at makeup.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=disappointed,So much makeup...I don't wear any.  Just gets in the way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,So much makeup...Jura is always trying to convince me to try some.
-3-female_must_strip,target:harley,targetStage:0=bored,Good, you're wearing enough makeup for both of us.  Saves me the trouble.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,Do you have someone to support you?  This switching can't be good for your mental health...or physical.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=calm,Your blonde version seems liable to get you killed.  Do you have friends?  Colleagues?  Are you alright?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=awkward,I'd hate to see you wander around with your...condition.  Are you sure you're safe, always switching as you do?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:3=thinking,Earth women are full of surprises...do you want to live on the Nirvana, just to have some support?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=calm,So, you travel through space, too?  Until recently we never got far past the Mejarian system.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,It took an accidental wormhole to actually fling us out of the Mejarian system.  <i>Your</i> Earth is a lot more adventurous.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Everyone on Earth, exploring space in peace and harmony?  This Star Fleet sounds nice.  Tarak and Mejare can't even unite the sexes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uhura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll agree that traveling through space teaches you a lot about other civilizations.  The colonies we've run into have all been different.
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,That's the way, ~name~.  You were winning for a while there.
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=addressing,Bad time for your streak to disappear.
-3-female_must_strip,targetTimeInStage:7-99=interested,I was worried for a moment there.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=confused,Let's make sure I understand this.  You go to a whole <i>school</i> of people with powers like yours?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2,marker:dropout=thinking,I actually dropped out of school as a girl...perhaps if that school was full of women with superpowers, I might have stayed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I'm very curious about this "Academy" of yours.  And every student has powers like you do?
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=thinking,School was never a pleasant experience for me...but then, I didn't have superpowers.  What's this Academy of yours like, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,"Magic," huh...I'd have my doubts, but the Paksis feels like magic sometimes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=calm,Do you really use magic, or just sufficiently advanced technology?
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you're a witch.  We got called witches on Mejare, but that was for suggesting men were human.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,So...you went to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough...but magic sounds like a good motivator.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,A boarding school?  Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...but not about <i>magic</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:hermione,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A boarding school?  I dropped out of school...though Mejare's didn't teach magic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "San Fransokyo"?  Just rolls right off the tongue...I'm sure Parfet would like working with you, if you do engineering.
-3-female_must_strip,target:gogo,targetStage:0=disappointed,You do something in engineering, correct?  You and Parfet would hit it off...once she learns to pronounce "San Fransokyo."
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,This is how Jura treats <i>everyone</i>.  She's quite proud of herself...and to be fair, no disasters have struck because of her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,I'll start reprimanding Jura when she starts getting women killed.  For now it's just an annoyance.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=bored,I'm the squadron leader, yes, but Jura's second-in-command.  Besides, she hasn't gotten anyone killed yet...
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:misato,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=disappointed,Jura's second-in-command.  She usually does her job...she just tends to get distracted with <i>this</i> sort of thing during downtime.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,What are you waving that thing around for?  Guns aren't children's playthings!
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,Put the gun down, would you?  What are you so afraid of?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...An acerbic, bestial woman waving a racketous mechanical gun around.  Just how I pictured Earth women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=angry,I can understand wanting to be armed in a seedy place like this, but you're taking this too far.  And don't wave it around!
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outfit that attracts men?  You'll have an easy time finding a man, then, Jura.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Talk to Jura about it...
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Interesting skin color.  Are you even human?  Or an Earthling?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare has strange hair colors...apparently Earth has strange <i>skin</i> colors.
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confused,I'm not sure what's more distracting: the skin color, or the wings.  Are you from Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really thought this was Planet Earth.  I wasn't aware people here could be so...colorful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, you're...a "clown"?  You shouldn't put yourself down like that...unless it's some kind of profession?
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly does a "clown" do for a living?  Are you some kind of public entertainer?
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=confused,So, clowns...entertain people?  All the entertainment on Mejare tends to focus on the evils of men.
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,I heard you were a "clown," which sounds a little degrading.  You don't seem too broken up about it, though.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  What do you think, Jura?  Was it for owning an anatomy book?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...like us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Good to see another woman who shares my fashion sense.  Even the color scheme is close...
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,My bodysuit is pretty standard among Mejarian styles...but looking at you, maybe it was inspired by Earth.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=interested,Bodysuits are comfortable, aren't they?  And efficient, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=disappointed,That bodysuit of yours looks awfully similar to my own.  I don't think I could pull off that helmet, though.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You certainly paint of different picture of Earthlings than the one I'm used to...
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Or is that your motivation for doing so?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy woman like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=disappointed,You said you rode in on a "pegasus"?  Mejare has few animals, but I've never even <i>heard</i> of that one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=confused,You're...<i>streaming</i> this?  I don't understand.
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Who are you talking to?
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  Whatever, no one knows who I am anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,You're <i>broadcasting</i> this?  They might recognize me on Mejare, but not Earth...
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=disappointed,Guess I'm getting a <i>Wanted</i> mugshot tonight.
-3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't like publicity...not one bit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So does Jura here.  Fire away.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You work as a <i>model</i>?  This is your chance, Jura.  Make connections.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm told you're into art.  If you want that life-sized portrait, Jura, here's your chance.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=disappointed,Videl...you keep mentioning your "dad."  What's a dad?
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...what's a father?
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=confused,Your "father" is famous...fathers are male parents, correct?
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Your "father" is famous...I can't even picture a man being a parent.
-3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=calm,Your father is a champion fighter...I wonder if B.C. could handle him.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,A woman can't afford to choke at the very end, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=interested,Poor showing, with your opponent nearly defeated.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,Try not to beat yourself, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2-99=addressing,You've nearly beaten me, so try not to beat yourself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet, though you seem a little more outgoing...but just as unkempt.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She wears glasses, too...and she sometimes neglects hygiene.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're like if Parfet and Paiway had a child together...and didn't teach her how to clean herself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got Paiway's build..and Parfet's glasses.  Are you old enough to be here?  You should have cleaned yourself, regardless.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little unkempt.  Women need to take pride in their bodies as well as their minds...Parfet gets like that, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,Jura's no fighter, but something tells me you and she would get along.  Two things, actually.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,Interesting gun, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to say anything...but that one eye is rather distracting.
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=confused,I guess women come in all shapes and eye counts on Earth...or are you not <i>from</i> Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:leela,targetStage:0=disappointed,No depth perception?  You'd make a poor pilot.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  Duero seems that way, too, even if he only shows it to Parfet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Take that how you will.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Besides Duero, I can't picture a man sitting still.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jane,targetStage:0=thinking,You're into art, you said?  Artists are good to have around...they tend not to kill people.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work as a <i>model</i>?  You and Jura here should talk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Isn't that you've always wanted, Jura?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Seems Earth women are capable of being vain, too, Jura...and models.  Have fun with this girl.
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=bored,You got to school with <i>men</i>?  Can't even imagine...
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,These "vampires" of yours sound like if the Harvest were even more supernatural than it already is.  Fearsome.
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=impressed,You work with computers?  I think Parfet's dabbled with them, though she likes machinery better.  Do they help with vampires?
-3-female_must_strip,target:willow,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Tell me more about these "vampires."  If they exist, I'm sure Earth will send them our way soon enough.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=interested,I won with <i>that</i>?  You're too much.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,Even with a <i>high card</i>, she finds a way to lose to me.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=addressing,I had a <i>high card</i>.  Talk about bad strategy.
-3-female_must_strip,hasHand:High Card=pleased,I had a <i>high card</i>.  At this point <i>Dita</i> could outplay you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,So, tell me about these "Phantom Thieves."  What is it you do?
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Phantom Thieves" of yours sound like pirates.  What do you steal, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=calm,Parfet is into computers.  You said you were, too, right?  Something about "Phantom Thieves"?
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You come from planet "America"?  Sounds like a big place.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're awfully proud of this "America" planet.  I suppose the colors are nice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>wrestle</i>?  Duero said they do something like that on Tarak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tina,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's this about wrestling?  ...Sounds like a male pursuit.  Physical posturing...
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries...with some men?  Men don't seem smart enough for that...
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  She's blind without her glasses, too...no mystery there.  But you solve those, yes?
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Parfet.  Are you any good with machines?  Or purely a mystery-solver?
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you're the type who clings to the past, ~player~.  That isn't healthy.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you aware there's a superior Velma character now, ~player~?  Don't cling to nostalgia like a fool.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and inform you there's a better Velma available for play now, ~player~.  This is Velma Classic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=bored,Still using the inferior characters of the past, just because they're comfortable...listen, ~player~, the game has evolved.  So should you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=disappointed,Velma Classic is just here for posterity, ~player~.  The Velma of today is far more on-model.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Wha--<i>don't bring up Misty</i>!  It's not like she'll understand.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,You--I--Misty and I are not an <i>item</i>.  I just give her advice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You know perfectly well Misty's into <i>men</i>, Jura...and also that she's too young.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Why do you try to twist my relationship with Misty into love?  She just...needs guidance.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=interested,Figures you'd try to change the subject upon losing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Nice try deflecting attention to me, but <i>you're</i> the one who lost.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Don't try to shift the focus to me.  You lost...time to strip.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Can't believe <i>Jura Basil Elden</i> is trying to shift the attention to another woman.
-3-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Ah, and I've staved off defeat.
-3-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,This is me playing seriously.
-3-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Thought you could brush me aside, did you?
-3-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,I'm under more stress than this every day.
-3-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,This is nothing next to managing a fleet of excitable young women.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we won't be here long.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=confused,Are you counting each bandage as one layer?  If not, this'll be over soon.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=impressed,...I really wasn't counting on seeing nudity this quickly.  At least it's a woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mileena,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Did I just walk in on a game that's nearly over?
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura would probably describe herself as a "goddess"...
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>Jura</i> dressed extravagantly...now we have a <i>goddess</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=bored,...Well, we know what your favorite color is, don't we?  Even your <i>hair</i> is purple...
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,Purple hair, purple outfit...even on Mejare, purple hair is a bit outlandish.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=thinking,I have some crewmates who wish their hair was a more exotic color, like your purple.  I suppose I should consider my blue strange...
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is that purple hair your natural color?  Where are you from?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there a reason you brought a knife?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,I'm watching you.  Why do you have that knife?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=annoyed,Make any sudden movements, and you'll be on the wrong side of that knife.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=angry,Don't you dare try anything with that knife.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Sorry to be insulting, but you look rather unevenly-proportioned.  You should exercise more.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look you're giving everyone?  This is just a game.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=bored,I'm trying not to comment on your body...Mejarians tend to be judgmental enough.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chara,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you seems off.  I'd suggest you relax.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=pleased,So, you work for an old woman too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,I hear an old woman is <i>your</i> superior, too...and that she's not as kind as the captain.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=addressing,Old women can be difficult to work for sometimes, wouldn't you agree?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pauling,targetStage:0=thinking,So you do unsavory work for this old woman you know?  I work for an old woman, too...she approached <i>me</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly full of energy.  Might even rival Dita, though I could never picture her playing this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Wherever this <i>Australia</i> planet is, its food must be nutritious.  You're energetic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=pleased,You're pretty energetic.  That's good to see in a pilot, and I suppose Dita proves discipline isn't a necessity.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=confused,...What's a lawyer?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=bored,You work in <i>law</i>?  Mejare has one law...obey the Grand Ma.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,There are no law practitioners on Mejare.  Only the state judges, and how badly they punish you for associating with men.
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,You're from some kind of ninja village, was it?  And what's a ninja, for that matter?
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=impressed,These "ninjas" of yours sound a lot like the telepathic people Hibiki got stuck with...
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=confused,Not to be rude, but what's the significance of your facial markings?
-3-female_must_strip,target:paya,targetStage:0=disappointed,Facial markings...I think Rabat's people have some, too.  Not that I trust them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,At least you're running out of clothes...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can't believe you've got more bullets than clothes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=disappointed,How could <i>anyone</i> be so fond of those racketous men's weapons?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll just look away...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Guess there's no changing you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=disappointed,Firing straight up?  Right out of Hibiki's playbook.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=annoyed,At least those can't hit anyone else...
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,A test subject...that's how Earth sees its colonies.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=impressed,Portals sound useful...even faster-than-light still takes a while.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chell,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  With a brooch and everything...you look the part.
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  The crown leads me in that direction...
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  That's who rules Mejare...
-3-female_must_strip,target:peach,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...the title doesn't make the woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Is this "darlin'" of yours a man?  That would explain a lot.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,Have you had a baby with this "darlin'" of yours?  I'm still not sure men are capable of making one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,I've gone through electroshock...and you need some.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0=confused,You went to a...<i>university</i>?  What's a university?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...so I wouldn't know about your "university."
-3-female_must_strip,target:zoey,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,These "zombies" of yours sound a lot like what the Harvest wants to turn us into.  Of course, Mejare's schools tried to do the same.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Here we go again...take cover.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Don't you care about safety?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,After surviving the first volley, you'd think a woman would know better than to push her luck.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,You're doing it <i>again</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Switzerland like?  Never heard of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...our only doctor is a man.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...I don't trust Duero's knowledge of women sometimes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a <i>doctor</i>?  The Nirvana could use you...Paiway's just a child nurse in training.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a student, yes?  And what does this Academy you attend teach you about?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,My school experiences...weren't the best.  But I'm curious what you've been learning in this Academy of yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shy...that's normally what I expect from students.  What is it you've been taught, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,A student?  I dropped out of school...I had to learn piloting the hard way.  What's taught in "Beacon Academy"?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=happy,Did you slip into your native language before?  That's a little cute.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1=pleased,Despite our differences, humans throughout the galaxy <i>did</i> agree on a language...
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3-5,targetSaidMarker:french1,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,Was that a taste of what they speak on planet France?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=pleased,Barnette's got green hair, too...but that's with the help of Mejarian genetic engineering.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=calm,Green hair isn't that strange on Mejare.  One of my pilots has it.  What about Earth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:1=impressed,Is your hair naturally green?  That'd be impressive for an Earth woman...
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,...You've never played poker before?  What do Earth women do during downtime?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=impressed,You've never played poker before?  Gascogne would have a field day with you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=confused,You've never played poker before, and you start with <i>strip</i> poker?
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're tall for a woman.  Might give Gascogne a run for her money.
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's this "America" planet known for?  Tall women?
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You report the news?  I was on the news as a little girl...wish I wasn't.
-3-female_must_strip,target:piper,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're a reporter?  It's been a while since I had a <i>positive</i> media appearance.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."vampire"?  You look human to me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do these "vampires" really suck blood?  Right out of the Harvest's playbook...
-3-female_must_strip,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=thinking,So, vampires suck blood.  Earth probably has a blood colony out there somewhere...poor souls.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from "Japan"?  Never heard of it...must be a remote planet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Whatever this "Japan" planet is, it seems to produce real oddities...
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=bored,You're an "idol"?  Mejare has idols...big pear-shaped statues we're told to honor.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=confused,"Virtual idol"?  Are you some kind of projection?  You're flickering.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,Congratulations, ~player~.  You've found what are probably my rarest lines.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  You must really like me, ~player~.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  Honestly, ~player~, that's a little flattering.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=pleased,I see Earth has also perfected cloning technology.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Glad you appreciate me enough to play with more than one of me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,More than one Meia?  That's...a little cute, ~player~.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,More than one of me?  Considering my responsibilities, that would really help.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,Would you look at that, ~player~'s figured out the offline version.  And apparently is very fond of me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,More than one Meia?  How flattering.  Be sure to try out Jura, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=happy,Never thought I'd say <i>these</i> lines.  I'm glad you like me so much, ~player~.  That's sweet.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=addressing,<i>Two</i> Meias?  Give Jura some attention, too, ~player~.  She's not a bad person at heart.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman.  I'm not sure if <i>Gascogne</i> could measure up to you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,Earth women can get pretty tall, it seems...but so can Mejarians, and I believe the gravity's the same.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think Gascogne's still got an inch on you, so don't feel self-conscious about your size.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=awkward,Do men like tall women?  I'm about middle-of-the-pack in that regard...
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=disappointed,You carry yourself well for your height, though you seem a little uneasy.  Do you not get out much?
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,Out of everyone here, you seem remarkably...normal.  In a way, that's refreshing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,As far as I can tell, you're quite standard for Earth women.  Don't take that as an insult...
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Hm.  Not sure what to make of you.  You seem rather straightforward.
-3-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:0=bored,As normal as can be...which is why I'm wary.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,...What in Ma's name am I looking at?  Are you <i>human</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I'll be perfectly honest.  You look inhuman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=confused,Er...what <i>are</i> you, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chica,targetStage:0=impressed,I thought the <i>Harvest</i> was terrifying.  My God.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Wha--<i>what are you doing</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't wave that thing around!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Don't fire that thing!
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,<i>Where's your trigger discipline</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=angry,Why did you <i>bring</i> that thing?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,What are these "video games" you play?  Sounds like something Dita would distract herself with instead of attending flight practice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0=pleased,Jura's a big fan of pearls...or really anything that shines.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Men aren't all that dangerous.  Just simpletons.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=disappointed,Surely you've grown up around men.  I don't have <i>that</i> benefit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_playing_with_boys,marker:shyness=impressed,I never thought an Earth woman would be so shy around men...
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a lawyer.  I'm assuming that means you work with the law?  Mejare's laws are absolute.
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,You "practice law," correct?  Where I come from, laws are handed down...and no one can argue them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=disappointed,What does a lawyer do, exactly?  Mejare doesn't allow women to argue the laws...if we could, men might be considered human.
-3-female_must_strip,target:calisto,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare doesn't allow legal arguments...and being a pirate, I'm on the wrong side of them.  But law is what you work with, correct?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Mejare uses too many natural resources...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=bored,Your planet must be pretty verdant for you to dress like that.  Tarak is a wasteland...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.  Though it seems your world has more nature...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=thinking,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.  Seems you live in a world with vegetation...
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...feeling alright, Orendi?
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,We've never run into aliens in our travels...didn't think I'd meet one <i>here</i>.  And you're certainly alien.
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you...<i>aware</i> of the rest of us?
-3-female_must_strip,target:orendi,targetStage:0=bored,...Would you please stop shouting?  Whatever you are...
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So...you go to school with <i>men</i>?  Surprised they can sit still long enough.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0=confused,What's a college?  ...What's a <i>community</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,Everyone is educated by the state on Mejare...they certainly fed me a lot of stories about Tarak.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "college" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you feast on men's energy, or something to that effect?  Way to confirm what Tarakkians already think.
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're certainly shapely.  Is that how a "succubus" lures men into her traps?
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=confused,Is all that really necessary?  And are those real wings?  I heard you say you were a <i>succubus</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=bored,You might actually give Jura some competition with that figure.  She's hunting for men herself...
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=impressed,I know a woman named Misty...well, a <i>girl</i> named Misty.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty,targetStage:0=thinking,I know a girl named Misty...she's from Pluto.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You look like a military type...though a rather unintimidating one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  You <i>claim</i> to protect, but only when it suits you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=bored,Oh, perfect.  A soldier.  Try not to kill anyone for fun before the game is over.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The ones I know enjoy indoctrinating children and shutting down housing districts.
-3-female_must_strip,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Titans," huh?  Those Harvest motherships can get pretty big.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you report the news?  Mejare's news agencies are all state propaganda.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,I'm not a fan of the media...my family has had some bad publicity on Mejare.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=bored,You're <i>reporting</i> this?  The last time I appeared on television, I was a little girl...
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=disappointed,I think I appeared on Mejarian television not too far back.  We were raiding an armory.
-3-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see a woman who shares my fashion sense...though it looks like a tight fit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,You just want attention...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,I wanted a challenge, and I get <i>you</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=annoyed,Just looking over here...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:2-6,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,For God's sake...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=confused,You go to school with <i>men</i>?  Sounds distracting.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,You're a student...I dropped out of school.  Bad times.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,I hope this "high school" of yours is a little less indoctrinating than Mejare's.
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're looking a little sickly.  Did ships from Earth do this to you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why is your skin pink?  Do you have a medical condition?  Earth is no stranger to poisoning populations it doesn't care for...
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're short like Paiway...and you look a little sickly with that skin.  Were you poisoned?  Did Earth do this to you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you alright?  Your skin...it's pink, and it looks unhealthy.  I wouldn't put it past Earth to do this to undesirables...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...You can't be serious.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...<i>Excuse me</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,...Can't you take this seriously?  Can't you <i>pretend</i> to do so?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:1=angry,I--who are you?  How'd you get in here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,They said you're a student...but something about you seems intense.  Like you know more than you let on...
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're a student.  The uniform matches...but something in your eyes doesn't.
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,I know this is rude, but...something seems off about you.  What did you say you did?  You're a student?
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,For a supposed student, there's something about the way you carry yourself that makes me wary...like you're one step ahead of us.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=disappointed,You seem a little too eager...and your dress doesn't seem too protective.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're a little...sex-obsessed, don't you think?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=awkward,You're creeping me out with all this sex-talk...are Earth women realy like this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=bored,You seem to know us all pretty well...perhaps a little <i>too</i> well, if you follow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You were trapped...in a computer?  I guess we were trapped in the Paksis once...
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=confused,You live in a...muh-more-puh-guh?
-3-female_must_strip,target:asuna,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is this "muh-more-puh-guh" how Earthlings pass the time?  You should be working.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So, you're...some sort of "princess"?  Not sure I know what that is...
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,So...does "princess" mean "light dresser"?  That would make more than a few of my crewmates princesses.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=awkward,...Could you explain what a "princess" is?  I'm...not from Earth, so I don't know its titles.
-3-female_must_strip,target:athena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is a "princess" a position of power on Earth?  You'd think an authority figure would wear more clothing...
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Are you...feeling OK?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You...<i>want</i> to strip?
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,I...who <i>are</i> you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You come from the middle of Earth?  I didn't know its population lived underground.
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't look quite human...and it's not just the ears.
-3-female_must_strip,target:arwen,targetStage:0=confused,You're an..."elf"?  You're going to have to explain what that means.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,You look like you're in great shape.  I respect that in a woman...very much.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Not to be too forward, but...your legs are so muscular.  What's your training routine?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Wow...whatever you do to exercise, I'd like to learn it.  You look fantastic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,You're a lot of woman, and in a good way.  Could I get your frame with enough training?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=impressed,Your build is impressive...and I wouldn't say to that to <i>any</i> strange woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=pleased,"Black Canary"?  Maybe I should get a professional name...to inspire fear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=confused,"Black Canary"?  I've never seen a canary, but I thought they were yellow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:black_canary,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=bored,"Black Canary"?  I <i>wish</i> Mejare had canaries...
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're from a...muh-more-puh-guh?  Use real words.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,You're an avatar?  As in, not really here?  Where are you projecting this from?
-3-female_must_strip,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=confused,This "virtual" business is new to me.  Why not just come here for real?
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=disappointed,These "vampires" of yours sound fearsome.  The Harvest probably wants blood from somewhere, too...
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=bored,Vampires suck blood, huh...there's probably an Earth colony for blood out there somewhere.
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=thinking,I wonder what the blood colony's people must look like.  Probably blushing all the time.
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0=calm,So, a man helps you fight vampires?  I work with a few men...out of necessity.
-3-female_must_strip,target:buffy,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,I dropped out of school...hope it's treating you better than it did me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is it true you're a "princess"?  I'm told you hold some authority...which makes me question why you're here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,I'm told you're a ruler of some sort...shouldn't you be <i>ruling</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=disappointed,I hear you're an authority figure where you're from.  I'm sure your subjects appreciate you spending your time like this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:1=annoyed,My experience with authority has always been that they don't deserve their power...you being here reinforces that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,A maid?  I had a maid growing up...I wish we had paid her more.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:oma_and_fama=bored,Being a maid is looked down upon on Mejare...just a stepping stone to finding the Oma of your children.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking,Mejare looks down on maids...Mejare looks down on a lot of professions.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=pleased,Mejare looks down on maids...but they're held in higher regard than pirates.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=confused,What's with the honorifics?  Strange language you must speak at home...
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,marker:honorifics=disappointed,What's with the honorifics?  Maybe Mejare could do with that kind of politeness...
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I'm told you hold some authority in a military organization.  I hope you're using that responsibly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,A military woman?  Excuse me for not being impressed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You don't seem quite as fiercely repulsive as the woman soldiers I've come to know.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,Military...nothing worse than having a soldier around.  Try not to kill anyone.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,<i>Now</i> are you done?  Or are you going to summon vines and perpetuate this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Stripping your flowers now?  Any more vegetation we should know about?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Is a bush next?  Are you stripping flowers and replacing them with branches?
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.  Although it would seem your outfit is branching out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=calm,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...say, you look a little different than before.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And is it just me, or did you dress up for this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides the outfits.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake_v4,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about your outfit seems unusual for you...strange, since I've never met you before.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,Are you a student...?  I went to state schools on Mejare when I was a little girl...
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=calm,You seem awfully shy to be playing a game like this.  Are you going to be OK?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  Do you even know how to play poker?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,Are you a student...?  How do men behave in school, anyway?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:shyness=disappointed,How'd a shy girl like you end up in this place?  You don't even look like an adult.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,Are you a student?  I dropped out of school...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=unimpressed,Taking another inch off of the stems?  Surely you can think of another way to waste our time.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,In case you were wondering, that's twice that you should've lost now.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=annoyed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=addressing,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...pure black is an interesting choice, if it's intentional.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...I don't think I know anyone with pure black hair.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  That black hair is imposing...as is your stark outfit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:blake,targetStage:0=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all...though no pilot of mine has pure black hair.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  So would Jura, if we were law-abiding Mejarians...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=pleased,You work as a <i>model</i>?  Probably what Jura wants deep down...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ami,targetStage:0=disappointed,You remind me of Jura.  Always bragging about her looks...although she might be more justified in doing so.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's a hedgehog?  Some kind of animal?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,"Hedgehog"...?  Mejare doesn't have many animals...
-3-female_must_strip,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about you looks off...like you aren't quite human.  But then, I used to see men that way, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=confused,...Where's your body, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,You look like a miniature Paksis.  Any relation?
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like the Paksis sprouted wings and shrunk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you big enough to hold the cards?
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=impressed,These "Evas" I've heard of actually seem like impressive technology.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You said something about "Evas" before?  My Dread sounds a lot more reliable...but still, they sound fearsome.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,These "Evas" sound like they're not to be trifled with.  Good thing the Earth I know doesn't have any.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=bored,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school...Mejarian schools are just government propaganda.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,So, you go to school with men?  Must be a pain getting them to sit still during a lecture.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into government.  Mejare's is in need of reform, to put it bluntly.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're into art.  Jura would probably ask you for a life-size portrait.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=disappointed,This "academy" of yours sounds like a school.  I dropped out of school...
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=calm,I'm told you're into art.  I know Duero painted Parfet something once, so maybe you two should talk.
-3-female_must_strip,target:angie,targetStage:0=thinking,You have a roommate at this school of yours?  I'd never be comfortable without my single room.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,I see you've got my affinity for words.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Hearing you loud and clear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=disappointed,Women shouldn't be afraid to speak their minds.
-3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=bored,At least your <i>hair</i> is expressive.

-3-female_must_strip,filter:pokemon,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_po,priority:381,marker:chi_po=bored,...Money?  These games make <i>money</i>?  All the money on Mejare goes to the state...

-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,You're, uh...a little pale.  Are you feeling alright?  And you're not wearing much...
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=confused,So <i>pale</i>...muscular, but...you look sickly, despite how little you're wearing.  Trouble breathing?
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> pale.  You're marble-white.  And you don't really have the wardrobe for this game...
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...it matches <i>yours</i>, Jura.  Can't say the arm does, though.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You're a fiery one.  How'd you lose your arm?
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...none of us have mechanical arms.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in outlandish hair colors...maybe we could regrow your arm.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I'd say I'm sorry, but...that mechanical arm looks pretty useful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself...and perhaps lift herself, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang_v4,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,What do you think, Jura?  Should we have our arms replaced with robotics?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is that a camera?  Paiway, our child nurse, is always skulking around with hers...so this is nothing new.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=bored,A camera?  Are you really going to photograph us all?  ...Whatever.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you trying to blackmail us with that camera?  I've been in the media for far worse than this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hope you don't think you're going to embarrass me with that camera.  I'm not exactly from here, anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,Even if you strip actual clothing, I've got quite the uphill battle ahead of me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Beating you won't be easy...there's a lot more than just your dress, it seems.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=smug,Looks like it'll take more than a few losses for you to strip anything meaningful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,I've been studying your outfit...this is going to take me a while to deal with.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  Might even make <i>Jura</i> jealous.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=bored,...About as much on as <i>Barnette</i> ever layers.  And she has a certain reputation for baring it all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,A <i>martial artist</i>?  You must be proud of your...assets.  Both of them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I can see two reasons why you and Jura are going to get along this evening.  And your martial arts skills aren't one of them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,<i>You're</i> a martial artist?  Even with...er...you're not off-balance at all?
-3-female_must_strip,target:tifa,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Are you really a martial artist?  You must have quite the developed musculature...on your back.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,<i>You're</i> a pirate?  They certainly dress much differently on Earth...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm a pirate, too...small universe we live in.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:0=impressed,An <i>Earth</i> pirate?  Well...the outfit is certainly different, and apparently the manner.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,Unthinkable that I'd be losing to you this badly.  Where was all this poker skill every other time we played?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=happy,I...I think I had forgotten you hadn't lost yet.  This is incredible, Jura!
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=interested,Jura, you're outplaying me like it's nothing.  When did you get so good at cards?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=interested,Your first loss, when I'm down to nothing at all...I never knew you could play cards this well.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  We should discuss formations!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=interested,These "Gundams" of yours sound a lot like Vanguards.  I wonder if my Dread could combine with them...
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,Oh, wow, another pilot!  We should talk after the game.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a <i>pilot</i>?  I only took up piloting a few years ago, but I've really fallen in love.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,It's good to see a fellow pilot!  You even look a little like Belvedere.

-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> pale.  This woman's marble-white.  And she doesn't really have the wardrobe for this game...
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale_swimsuit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...Is there no sun on your planet?  You're certainly dressed for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is a card game.  Why'd you come armed with...whatever that thing is?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=calm,You look pretty good with that sword.  Maybe you could give Jura some instruction.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=impressed,Fascinating.  That sword looks like it's made from the lasers our rings use.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Hunting space pirates?  Some pirates have a good reason for what they do...
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...And you hunt <i>space pirates</i>.  I see.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,So, you travel through space, too...and hunt space pirates.  Good luck with that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=addressing,There's a pirate named Rabat I wouldn't mind you catching for us...since you travel through space.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...and origin.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree, Samus?  Even out in space...
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and you <i>hunt space pirates</i>?  I'll keep that in mind.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dawn,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's a vivid hair color...look, Jura, another one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You're a fiery one...she's how I picture your and Barnette's daughters, Jura.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...you've certainly got the energy befitting yellow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...your yellow betrays an intense personality.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  You've even got the fire of Jura here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:yang,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently...you've certainly got the spirit for it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=confused,Are...you OK?  You're all clammed up...
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like a schoolgirl.  Are you sure you want to be here?  Is someone making you do this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Are you alright...Saki, was it?  You look so nervous...
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=impressed,Saki?  That's you, right?  You've hardly said a thing...and you're turning red.
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've seen better days...and are about to see worse ones.  Are you sure you want to play this?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,You said you were a "Street Fighter," correct?  I suppose that <i>would</i> get you into shape.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,You said something about street fighting?  I've been in street fights.  I'd rather not go back to that, but if you like it...
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,You said you're a street fighter?  That's a harsh life...I lived on the streets when I was younger.
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=thinking,Street fighting isn't the kind of thing I'd glorify, but if it makes you happy...just take care of yourself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,That's quite the outfit.  You may have competition, Jura...but then, you like that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I've heard Earth women dress like you to attract men.  Mejarians do it to attract each <i>other</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Well, you're certainly devoted to matching colors.  I wear what I have.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=confused,You...what <i>are</i> you?  Where are your eyes?  Can you even see the cards?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you some kind of apparition?  Smacks of the Paksis's work.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=disappointed,I wasn't going to comment on the floating, but...you're floating.  What <i>are</i> you, exactly?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=bored,...I hope you don't think the floating and lack of eyes is normal to us.  Or maybe it <i>is</i> on Earth...
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=angry,You look like a military type...I <i>hate</i> soldiers.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Always looking for a state-approved means of harassing people.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,I know you military types.  Happy to shut down and kill, never there when it's time to rebuild.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:hates_soldiers=annoyed,You'll have to excuse my dislike of woman soldiers.  The last one I met had her knee in my back.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=disappointed,Someone else with blue hair...too bad you're a soldier.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a..."princess"?  For nobility, you don't seem too informed...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  Then why are you here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=disappointed,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She'd never lower herself to games like this...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elena,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though I suppose you're lowering yourself by playing this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=thinking,This planet "Australia" of yours sounds rough around the edges.  Just like Tarak...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Australia like?  Never heard of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=awkward,Australians sure have a unique...manner of speaking.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shazza,targetStage:0=disappointed,...How exactly did this "Australia" develop its dialect?
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I was told you were a spacefarer, as well...and a pilot.  Good to see a woman who understands my situation.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Is it true you're a space pilot?  So am I...I'd love to discuss formations or maneuvers after the game is over.
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone said you're a pilot.  I never expected to meet a woman like that here...what's your ship like?
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,I heard you're a space pilot.  I command a Dread squadron myself...what is it that you do?
-3-female_must_strip,target:faye,targetStage:0=happy,Someone told me you're a space pilot.  I've really fallen in love with piloting myself, though I only have a few years' experience...
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a <i>goddess</i>?  Don't be so vain.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You're a goddess because you live in the sky?  There's a lot more to the universe than <i>that</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,A "goddess"?  I'm sorry if I ever called you vain, Jura.  This is a new one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You have some competition for extravagant dress, Jura.  And vanity, apparently.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing,Would you look at that, Jura?  We're perfectly even now...unless you're hiding an accessory in that thing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing,Both naked...both on the brink of defeat.  Thrilling, isn't it?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=interested,Now we're both an inch away from defeat...just how I like it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing,Nothing left to defend you now...nothing but your own skill.  As it should be.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Amarone.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...besides Valore.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sharla,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Not common on Mejare...and B.C. doesn't count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,This "magic" of yours sounds pretty interesting.  Can it be taught?
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you're immortal.  Is that in the sense of never aging, or never dying at all?
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=impressed,If you really <i>can</i> wield magic, I'd be honored to learn it...it sounds useful.
-3-female_must_strip,target:evie,targetStage:0=calm,The Paksis has proven to me that powers beyond human ability exist...so I'm willing to believe you might have some.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,I feel your pain.  I command a short, overconfident man myself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=disappointed,Well, this is <i>one</i> way to grow closer to your colleagues.  I sure wouldn't want any crewmates here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit=addressing,Surely a <i>goddess</i> wouldn't need a man to help her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Just what I wanted to hear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=pleased,Of course you've been lying.  You don't know what sincerity <i>means</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=addressing,I usually just assume as much.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,Have you <i>ever</i> been completely honest with me?
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=addressing,I'm sure Barnette would concur on that subject.
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,...I'm sorry, you said you were a <i>genie</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,What exactly is a "genie"?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0=confused,Is "genie" some kind of Earth race?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Amarone never calls herself a genie...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=confused,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  Valore never called herself a genie...
-3-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Does "genie" just mean "dark skin"?  B.C. never calls herself a genie...but then, she doesn't exactly count.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You said you come from the plains?  Sounds nice...Mejare's not very verdant, and Tarak's even worse.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,You come from the plains, you said?  My parents took me to the plains when I was a little girl...it was fun to run around.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,The plains, you said you lived in?  Somehow I doubt the Earth I know has any green left...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You study <i>human culture</i>?  What exactly are <i>you</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  I could probably learn from you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You study <i>human culture</i>?  Duero has an anatomy book you might be interested in reading...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,"Pearl"?  Jura's already a big fan of yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=impressed,Even for an Earth woman, that looks like pretty old-fashioned dress.  Your manners are similarly classical...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,I could have sworn I saw you at another table than this one...guess it must have been a similarly passive woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=confused,How'd you lose that bit of your finger?  You seem rather demure to be in combat...
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=disappointed,You don't seem very assertive.  I wouldn't think this game would attract a shy woman like you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,And you call <i>me</i> chilly, Jura.  At least I show my face.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Clearly I need to show less emotion, then.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You're right.  I could really improve my stoicism by watching her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A <i>concession</i>?  I thought you were going to tease me all night.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I'm sure she has her reasons.  Stoicism is important for a leader...
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=smug,I see that choker.  Don't think you were fooling anyone.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Clearly, that necklace is next.  Let's get it over with.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,Looking at what's left, you've got the choker...and then the dress.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,I hope you don't think you're clever for saving the choker.  It's right below your face.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,It can get lonely out in space, wouldn't you agree?  ...Apparently not with a "Borg collective."  I apologize.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=impressed,Oh, you're not from Earth, either?  ...What's this "Borg" all about?
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Borg" sounds a lot like the Harvest...taking whatever they want.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,We used to think men were just a collective, too...maybe I shouldn't make fun.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense.
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=thinking,Your "Star Fleet" sounds nice.  Humans are all scattered on different planets where I'm from...though we don't have to deal with this "Borg."
-3-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you travel through space, too...and the "Borg" sounds suspiciously similar to the Harvest.  We'll watch out for them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I'm not sure I'd want to date someone who'd agree to it in a seedy place like this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Unless she's heading to Mejare soon, I can't see that relationship working out.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You seem far more interested, Jura.  She <i>is</i> blonde, after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe <i>you</i> could flirt with her and bring her back.  Barnette could use some target practice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe if she agreed to join the crew...but what from I hear, she <i>hunts</i> pirates.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=confused,You're...a little thin on clothes to be playing this, don't you think?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  You've barely got anything on.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=unimpressed,I've heard of Valentine's Day...but that's for love, not indecency.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=bored,Shouldn't you have come to a strip poker game...<i>clothed</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:zizou_valentine,targetStage:0=pleased,That's about how much Barnette wears with her apron.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,This girl gives me the creeps...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,What's with that look in your eyes?  Like an animal playing dead...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ayano,targetStage:0=disappointed,"Yandere"...must be from some archaic Earth language.
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,It's <i>poker</i>, not <i>pokermon</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=confused,You train pokuh--<i>what</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=thinking,These <i>Pokemon</i> sound interesting...Mejare doesn't have many animals.
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,You capture animals for your own amusement...sounds a little cruel, but Mejare treats men that way.
-3-female_must_strip,target:may,targetStage:0=disappointed,These <i>Pokemon</i> nipping at your heels sounds like Pyoro when he's making his rounds.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look a little on edge.  It's just a card game.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's an interesting streak in your hair.  Mejarians have unusual hair colors, but not on specific parts...the red matches your attitude.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=addressing,I'm told you spend a lot of time fighting woman authority figures.  Guess we're not so different...even if your demeanor is a bit acerbic.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=disappointed,That red streak seems to betray your attitude.  Just try to relax...
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=interested,<i>Two</i> Juras?  Well, you've certainly dolled yourself up to earn this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=bored,I guess all that teasing really did the trick, Jura.  ~player~ loves you enough to put another one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=unimpressed,Good.  Twice the vanity, half the responsibility.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0,count-jura:2=thinking,I don't make any effort to look beautiful, so I see why ~player~ would want two of you instead...
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=calm,These bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,I suppose your suit is next.  I <i>did</i> kindly set an example for you to follow.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=interested,Come on, Ochako...the boysuit is no issue.  I did it without complaining.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,The suit, then?  Just shut your eyes and remember how I achieved the same.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,There's nothing shameful about losing your bodysuit...<i>I</i> did it, after all.  You'll be fine.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's fashion sense...that is, less is more.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pleased,You have Barnette's sense of style...that is, skin is always in style.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  That's rare on Mejare...you'd turn heads.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Your skin is dark.  Is that common on Earth?  Few Mejarians are that way...
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=disappointed,Dark skin...besides Valore and Amarone, I'm not sure I know any Mejarian women like you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,marker:dark_skin=thinking,Most Mejarians are pale, but your skin is dark.  So is Valore's...but that's beside the point.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...our outfits tend to vary, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...you've got some strange outfits yourselves.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.  Besides those bizarre outfits.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.  And dress herself in different ways.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0,count-ruby_v4:1=pleased,Did you get dressed up for this?  I know a few Mejarians that are obsessed with fashion...
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,One look at your outfit tells me we'll be here a while.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=calm,Our names are pretty close, Mei.  Whose do you think is better?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in climate science?  Tarak could use a woman like you...if women didn't terrify them.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You work in climate science?  Maybe you could convince Mejare to allocate its resources better.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,So, what's planet China like?  Never heard of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=confused,You...<i>freeze</i> people?  Misty was in cryogenic sleep, but...your way sounds dangerous.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've got to slim down.  A woman has to stay fit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=thinking,Someone said you gave up on school.  So did I...
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like you get a lot of exercise.  Always good to see in a woman.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=disappointed,You said something about a <i>killer</i>?  Earth's no stranger to killing, as far as I'm concerned.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,Is there a reason you felt the need to come armed to a friendly card game?  Especially with men's mechanical sidearms?
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see Earth women are still stuck with men's clunky kinetic weapons.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,If you're so into weaponry, try Mejare's laser rings.  They're a lot quieter than those racketous male ones.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd get along with Barnette...if you seemed capable of getting along with anyone.  She likes men's mechanical guns.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,You sure like to talk big...as long as you've brought those clunky men's guns to a card game.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...Is there a reason you keep waving those clunky kinetic guns around?  Women should know better than to use male weapons.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,...You don't need to start any fights.  I certainly don't want to hear the racket of those men's sidearms you've got.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,I'll never understand Barnette's fixation on clunky men's guns...or yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=disappointed,I hear there's a male version of you.  I'd hate to see the male version of <i>me</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,So, you're wealthy enough to vary your attire?  I grew up wealthy...didn't last.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors, too...none of us have white, but maybe money does that to you.  As well as letting you change outfits.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,Genetic engineering on Mejare has resulted in some pretty outlandish hair colors...seems you could afford a wardrobe change, too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,I should have expected a wealthy woman to change her wardrobe...I would, too, if I owned anything.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=thinking,You work in a team of women?  And your outfit is different...we don't really have uniforms, either.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,count-weiss_v4:1=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself.  And has the finances to vary her outfit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,You're awfully dressed-up for this game.  Seems pointless when your clothes will come off anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=disappointed,Is that the kind of outift that attracts men?  If so, Jura will have an easy time finding one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,Makeup...don't see the point.  Jura certainly does, but I've never seen eye-to-eye with her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=bored,All dolled-up...just another form of dishonesty.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You don't quite seem dressed for the occasion here.  Unless you'd rather just get it over with.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking,Just like challenging yourself, based on how little you're wearing?  I just rushed over in what I usually wear.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,At least you seem to like the attention.  Based on your outfit, you're going to attract a lot of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,You've got enough energy for both of us.  Neither of us is wearing very much, though...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  A Mejarian judge called Jura a witch...for possession of an anatomy book.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're a "witcher"?  Mejarians who associate with men get called witches...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ciri,targetStage:0=bored,The word "witch" gets us a little touchy sometimes...I apologize.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,And Jura calls <i>me</i> chilly...
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=impressed,You look like that outfit has <i>never</i> come off.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=thinking,You can show your face, Raven...I know being open with people can be hard.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=disappointed,People say I never smile...are you the same way?
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...With <i>magic</i>?
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  I guess <i>magic</i> would make you worthy of it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=thinking,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  Well, she can't use <i>magic</i>...
-3-female_must_strip,target:riva,targetStage:0=bored,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...but magic might give you a good reason to think that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=disappointed,How could an <i>Earth woman</i> be so shy around men?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3,marker:shyness=confused,Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around men?  What's the issue?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0,totalMales:1-3=disappointed,If you want to learn about men, talk to Dita.  She's obsessed.

-3-female_must_strip,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_mush,priority:381,marker:chi_mush=awkward,...Do you two know each other, Chiaki?  Is this woman famous?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=pleased,Good to see someone who shares my fashion sense...on most days.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:bodysuit=calm,Bodysuits can get uncomfortable, wouldn't you agree?  I hear you normally wear one.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=pleased,You pilot a mech?  So does Hibiki...and he's learning.  But he always dresses the same, unlike you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:country_as_planet=calm,So, what's planet Korea like?  Never heard of it...is this how people dress there?
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,count-d.va_cruiser:1,marker:pilot=happy,You're a pilot, too?  Mechs, Dreads, they're all fascinating...even though you're not dressed for the part today.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=confused,"Dark Magician Girl"?  That's some sort of <i>title</i>, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't you have some sort of first name?  "Dark Magician Girl" is too long to say in the heat of battle.
-3-female_must_strip,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=disappointed,Dark Magician <i>Girl</i>?  Children aren't allowed here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...I thought <i>Marinette</i> was Ladybug.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,...So what you're saying is, Marinette made her public debut before Samus?
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=confused,...What's "1981"?  Sounds old...Marinette doesn't look old, especially not older than Samus.
-3-female_must_strip,target:samus,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:videogametriviatime,notSaidMarker:chi_sam,count-marinette:1,marker:chi_sam=awkward,Should you be talking about Samus and Marinette like this?  I'm totally lost...
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You look like you've got my temperament.  Did someone elbow you into doing this, too?
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:men_in_school=disappointed,You go to school with men?  They don't seem able to focus for long enough...and you don't seem happy to be here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0,marker:dropout=bored,You're a student...I'm a dropout.  Let's leave it at that...since you seem annoyed regardless.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're barely bigger than Paiway.  Children aren't allowed here...and you seem miserable about it, anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=disappointed,My crewmates and I all have different hair colors...we don't base our identities off of that.

-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=pleased,You work in a team of women?  Well...seems Earth and Mejare aren't that different after all.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=interested,Good to see a woman who can carry herself, apparently.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:bodysuit=impressed,That's quite the outfit.  I thought <i>my</i> suit was revealing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=confused,If that suit is meant to be a disguise, this "France" planet must be taxing on the eyes.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:blue_hair=impressed,Hm?  Someone else with blue hair...
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,You're from planet "France"?  Well...it's certainly got an aroma.

-3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, you solve mysteries?  The Paksis is one big glowing mystery.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daphne,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'm told you get captured a lot.  Allies are important to have...but a woman should be strong on her own.

-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,What's a princess?  Some kind of leadership position?  You seem more like a dressed-up athlete.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=confused,A princess...is that like the Grand Ma?  She's certainly not as athletic as <i>you</i> look.
-3-female_must_strip,target:daisy,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're <i>royalty</i>?  I don't like it when people assume they're better than others...though you might have an athletic edge on me.

-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-2-pleased,At least I don't have the weight of the game on me now.  I can focus on analyzing how you've layered instead.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-4-pleased,I'm masturbating...that's all you need to know.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-3-pleased,Out of the many things that aren't any of your business, Jura, that's the most of all.

-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=mast-3-pleased,It's better going naked anyway...it forces you to rely on nothing but wits.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=mast-4-pleased,Here comes the final test of your skill.  Don't let me down, Jura.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=mast-3-pleased,You can still win this, Jura.  Believe in yourself...I made you play this with me all the time for a reason.

-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=mast-3-pleased,The suit, then?  Just shut your eyes and remember how I achieved the same.
-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=mast-2-pleased,There's nothing shameful about losing your bodysuit...<i>I</i> did it, after all.  You'll be fine.

-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,Congratulations.  You've now lost several times over, even as a cheater.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=mast-3-pleased,For someone so petrified of being naked, you've done a poor job of avoiding it.

-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-3-disappointed,You've lost, Amalia.  You <i>are</i> naked, after all...unless you've got more plants to summon.

-2-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Give me something to see so my mind doesn't drift to my crewmates.  Like the one next to me.

-1-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested-2,<i>Please</i> tell me you're not so attached to that thing that you're finished off now.
-1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=addressing-2,So you <i>can</i> speak.  What was that all about?

-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:5=addressing-2,I have a hard time believing you're actually worried about this.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=pleased-2,I must say, Launch, this blue-haired version of you is much more...tolerable.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=happy-2,You're certainly more pleasant like this.  I'll try to make sure you don't sneeze again.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=pleased-2,That blonde version of you was crass and rude.  You're much more polite...though it's to the point of being demure.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:2=addressing-2,I can't say I support women being total pushovers, but I'll take this polite version of you over the crude blonde one.

-1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored-2,Here we go again...
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased-2,Very funny.  Maybe I'll do that just to spite you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing-2,You're quite the sore winner.  Good thing you don't usually win.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing-2,Make fun all you want.  I'm just happy to see you do so well.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased-2,Are you sure you want my unfashionable hands touching your things?
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing-2,Jura, there's many things I feel you have the right to know about me.  That's not one of them.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased-2,I'd rather not say...I guess that just makes you want to know all the more.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored-2,Perfect.  I'm never going to hear the end of this from you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=stretching-2,None of your business...my sexuality is my own.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=happy-2,Your first loss, after all this time.  I'm proud of you, Jura.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=interested-2,Great work, Jura.  You beat me soundly...now finish the job.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=happy-2,I never stood a chance.  I never knew you could play cards so well...
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing-2,You've been truly magnificent, Jura.  All I need is this kind of execution in your piloting,

-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored-2,That's none of your business.  But of course you'll try to butt in regardless...

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.

0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've just lost, so not sure I accept that.  But why are you wearing the blindfold, then?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...So what's your reasoning for wearing it?  Some kind of Earth fashion statement?

0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,See <i>better</i>?  I'd like an explanation for that...and why you wear it in the first place.

0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  You could try to act that way, then.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,Then I suggest you stop leering at me like a killer.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I consider men in general to be a threat, so maybe it's just my nerves.  I invite you to convince me of that.

0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Small, talkative, male.  You and Hibiki might as well be...what's the word?  <i>Brothers</i>?

0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Glad you took it in stride.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...I would've preferred it if you focused on flirting with women, if anyone.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Sex is no obstacle for your affections, is it?  Good to know...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Should I tell Barnette you're flirting with <i>men</i> now, too?  Actually, she probably already knows...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=impressed,...Your clothing has a visual feed?  Earth really <i>is</i> more advanced...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm going to stop asking questions.  Apparently Earth technology is beyond my grasp...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm not sure if that counts as cheating.  Why not just use your eyes?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I have a visual feed, too.  It's called my eyes.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=awkward,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=bored,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
0-female_removing_accessory=calm,...
0-female_removing_accessory=calm,Smart idea to wear that.  You might be tough to beat.
0-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Maybe I should have brought something like that...
0-female_removing_accessory=awkward,I hardly recognize some of these accessories...
0-female_removing_accessory=calm,Smart.  Don't push yourself further than your opponent does.
0-female_removing_accessory=calm,I figured as much.  I don't have much to lose in the first place.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,I don't even <i>want</i> to beat you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,The typical response of a woman with something to hide.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your sudden panic is very convincing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...The least you could do is make an effort to convince me of that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  That's obvious from the worry on your face.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=bored,Neither do I...but that's no reason to be ashamed.  I'm not going to let anyone relish it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,Do you think <i>I</i> do?  You look perfectly fit...don't give them the satisfaction of seeing that this bothers you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=addressing,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't have money.  I was just making conversation.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I'm happy to discuss the finer points of piloting, but you're mistaken if you think I was making an offer...or have money at all.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I wasn't looking for a business transaction.  My crew doesn't use money regardless.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I see money is primarily how you operate, then.  My crew has none...and you can forget I said anything.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,...Wait, I wasn't sure at first, but--are you <i>levitating</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--wait, how are you levitating like that?  What's going on?  Ochako?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Ochako, why are you floating?  Did I miss something?  I was looking at the cards...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, are you <i>floating</i>?  W-what's this all about, Ochako?  I should have paid more attention...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  I thought it was Jura at first, but no, it's you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,I--you--<i>don't bring up Kahlua</i>.  We barely know these people.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Don't--don't tell her our life stories, Jura.  Kahlua has nothing to do with this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,If you knew I liked spending time with Kahlua, why didn't you just leave me with <i>her</i> again?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Any charm I had has been crushed by being dragged here...and leave Kahlua out of this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't practice enough with your rapier, Jura.  It just weighs you down.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,Not <i>again</i>.  Why are you doing this?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Oh, great.  Another vortex.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=impressed,The people you meet in these sorts of seedy dumps...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,Ugh...not <i>again</i>.  This is going to give me a headache.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Wha--what are you...</i>
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,...Vriska?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,V-Vriska?  What's...<i>happening</i> to you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,...<i>Vriska</i>?  <i>Vriska</i>!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "tiara"?  ...Must be that jewelry.  Why do you wear it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your tiara...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  Wherever it is you live.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=confused,Is that tiara what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just for decoration?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=bored,Does that have any value?  ...No, I'm not going to steal it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,I don't know what I expected.  Well, no.  I expected <i>this</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Seems about right for you.  Can't say you're not having fun.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,This really is the perfect game for you.  The less thought you put into it, the more you get to flaunt your body.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,I figured they weren't part of the dress...never watched you disrobe very intently.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...Don't be a cheater, Jura.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,That hardly counts.  Don't cheat, Jura.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,Come on, Jura, take this seriously.  It <i>was</i> your idea.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,<i>Jura</i>...don't start cheating right off the bat.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,That's actually more substantial than I expected of you.  Those boots are your pride and joy...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I figured you'd wait a while for that...you're never without those boots.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,You love those boots...maybe without them on, you'll focus on the cards.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=impressed,Your <i>boots</i>?  If anything were staying on, I figured it'd be those...

0-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,...Why are you doing this to me?  I was just being polite...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Only Jura knows for sure, but that should be the last of the small things...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Normally she wears <i>more</i> jewelry.  This is probably the end of things...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,If you're getting annoyed with her teasing, that's probably the last of it.  And she's not putting in much effort otherwise...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Your accessories just keep on going...but I think that's the last of them.  You can never be sure...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're starting the exhibitionism a little early, don't you think?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you exposing yourself on purpose?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Perhaps presenting like that will prepare us for the nudity to come.  Considerate of you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Kyu, you're...showing.  Actually, you probably know that, don't you?

0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless you--uh...<i>Launch</i>?  Your hair is...blue now.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Jura has a sword like that...but she doesn't practice enough.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>Words</i>, huh?  Sounds nice, but I'd like to see you try to reason with Mejarian imperials.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't be so high and mighty.  If you're capable of fighting evil, you're capable of perpetrating it, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Can't you give me a straight answer?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I'm a pirate.  So I have to deal with military types on a regular basis.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare's military isn't known for its commitment to human rights.  So I work with pirates.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I guess that was presumptuous of me.  I don't know what Earth's military is like, but Mejare's is corrupt.  I'm a pirate...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I pilot for a pirate crew to stage raids on Mejare's military.  So I'm not fond of them, considering the crewmates of mine they've killed.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  As in, like Jura.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see.  People say I don't laugh enough, so maybe you'll be of assistance there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm not known among the crew for my sense of humor, but I invite you to try.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=bored,Hm.  Never had a stable job myself...well, not one they pay me for.  But if you could make me laugh, I welcome it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking,I certainly don't want to be here, so if that's true...I could use a laugh.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Management?  Who's watching us play this?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm so confused.  Are you some kind of repeat offender?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Whether or not you are, you seem awfully touchy about it...not what I would expect from a deity.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do people question your divinity often?  You seem defensive for someone so above us mere mortals.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,Surely a goddess would feel secure enough not to worry about a mortal's accusations.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,You may have the power of a goddess, but it seems your ego is all too human.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,I've seen enough of the supernatural to believe you, but I figured a goddess would be more...secure.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Oh, it's that...jewelry.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I don't like politics...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  A woman who relies on a title should rethink her identity.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=annoyed,Jewelry marking your inflated importance...politics disgust me.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,Finally putting down those ridiculous kinetic weapons.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,I couldn't care less about those things...now that they're gone.  I feel obligated to give you a laser ring.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see.  And what is this "Flame Tribe"?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,Just making conversation...I'm not interested in fashion.  But what's this Flame Tribe, exactly?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I'm assuming you belong to this "Flame Tribe"?  That sounds interesting.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "crown"?  You seem fancy enough already...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I still don't know what you're supposed to be ruling over.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just your claim to...space?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Does that jewelry mark you as ruler of your observatory?  Wherever it is in space?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=awkward,...Listen, I'm not the most talkative woman myself, but you look absolutely miserable.  Don't suffer quietly...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're blushing, Saki.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Your defensiveness still leaves me in doubt.  You can tell me if something's wrong.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...My pilots lie to me all the time, Saki.  And they're better liars than you are.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Saki, look.  I can tell when someone is distressed.  It's part of my job.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=confused,Sector...?  Not sure how your federation organizes space, but I come from Mejare.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare.  It's...less than stellar.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=bored,I come from Mejare, the planet of women...not a healthy place.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare, Earth's uterus colony.  What sector it's in is beyond me...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I should've known you'd threaten me just for saying that.  You're a walking stereotype.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,..At least you didn't cling to it.  Then I'd <i>really</i> be worried.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,There's no reason for that.  Bodysuits are slim and practical...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,What's wrong with the way you are now?  You look good, and it stays out of your way.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose heroes don't have much more choice in their outfits than pirates do...but bodysuits are good to have.  I'd never complain about mine.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's too bad...still, I would recommend keeping the suit.  They've always served me well...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2-3,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...I see.  I'm afraid my piracy is limited to the material.  How do you do this?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...Is that so?  We tend to steal...food, fuel, and weapons.  What are your methods?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...You really don't seem the type, but that's...fascinating.  How exactly do you achieve that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,Uh...that doesn't sound like it would help people.  Maybe you could elaborate?

0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,Tomatoes?  That would fly over a Tarakkian's head.  They only eat synthetic pellets.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,What's wrong?  It's just a belt.  Are you alright?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=awkward,If you're so shy, maybe you shouldn't be playing this...I don't want to see a woman all broken up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,...Don't ask me how you're going to get all the way down to nude.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,I'll just hope you manage to win.  Stripping looks physicially painful for you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Is it the only thing that symbolizes your title?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I'm not following the politics here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=calm,A "crown"?  You've no need for titles or jewelry, Daisy.  You should be an athlete...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,O-oh no, I don't want to be a bother...my build doesn't even compare.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,N-no, you don't have to, Chun-Li.  I was just being complimentary...you look much better than I do.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-tips?  I don't want to impose.  And I certainly don't stack up to you...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-that's not necessary...I just need to work harder, I'm sure.  There's no need to compliment me, with the way you look...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'd like to know more about these "video games."  They sound interesting, if impractical.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about these "video games" sounds familiar...like a lot of the women here would know them, at least.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=pleased,Parfet's good with computers.  Maybe she'd like "video games" like you do...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=bored,"Video games" honestly sound like our flight simulations.  Never liked those...not real enough.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,So, do you play these "video games" of yours in school?  Sounds better than Mejarian propaganda classes.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Rude?  You're awfully defensive after some honest comments.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,At least you love your home planet.  Quiz me on Mejare.  I won't pull any punches.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,...So is a "country" some kind of special planet I should know about?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that didn't last long.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that's <i>one</i> down.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Looks like men have a use after all...thinning the herd.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=addressing,It covers everything, but it hides nothing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=calm,Don't be ashamed.  It's a perfectly sensible choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Bodysuits are comfortable and efficient, but they leave nothing to the imagination.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Your whole figure is on display, Marinette.  Of course, on Mejare, no one minds.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Thanks.  But it's common on Mejare.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Blue hair is run-of-the-mill on Mejare.  There's prettier faces underneath than mine.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Matches my eyes?  If you say so.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=thinking,...Thank you.  Yours is nice, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  I was watching that from the beginning.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,You seemed the type to leave that on just to lure people into a false sense of security.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=pleased,Smart to leave that on until now.  Some of us probably got complacent...I've tried not to.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Clever.  But don't think I hadn't noticed that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=confused,What exactly is <i>Jerusalem</i>?  A man's name?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=bored,I understand spiders' importance.  I still don't like them.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders,marker:riches_to_rags=disappointed,I've lived in apartments infested with spiders.  You'll have to forgive my distaste for them.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,The point of my suit is functionality.  It doesn't encumber me.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Are you saying you wear that for fun?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,My suit is standard-issue.  I don't get to complain about comfort.
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,...
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,Let's keep going.  This is fluff.
0-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Your "~clothing~"...why wear that?
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,Your clothing can be quite interesting...I've never seen some of these items.
0-female_removed_accessory=thinking,You're still off to a decent start...like a lot of missions.
0-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Seems you've got a ways to go.  I don't.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm willing to believe it.  But actions speak louder than words...especially for an Earthling.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'll just be quiet and let your behavior speak for itself, Misato.  But Earthlings put me on edge already.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll keep that in mind, Misato.  I'm already wary of Earthlings in general.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,I haven't had positive experiences with Earthlings, either...so a soldier just alerts me even further.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Somehow I doubt that's the end of your teasing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,Looking at your outfit...this is far from over.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,At least you're enjoying yourself.  I think I'm starting to see what you're going for, stripping-wise.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,I'm starting to spot some more likely stripping candidates...this'll be a while.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,...If it makes you feel better, Blake, you still look nice.  I'm sorry about your ears...whatever the reason is that you hid them.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,...You're not giving these people a good first impression of us.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Well, now Earth knows what to think of Mejarians.  Underhanded.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,I know we're pirates, but these people haven't done anything worth cheating them over...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Cheaters and murderers from Mejare.  Good first impression.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,Birth...control?  What's that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Yes, she really is my second-in-command.  I swear I've gotten her to focus on piloting occasionally.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,I know Jura doesn't seem like much of a pilot at the moment, but you have to understand how much she loves her body...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Try not to let this teasing get to you.  Jura's very proud of her body...she wants to make you beg for it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Yes, Jura's really my second-in-command...because piloting is second among her priorities.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Drinking is disgusting...I would know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,You have a nice figure, Misato.  Don't ruin it with booze.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Despite the alcohol, I guess you still have the professionalism to work for this "NERV," whatever it is.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Drinking...it's the sort of thing I'd <i>expect</i> from a military woman.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I see.  I'll keep that divinity in mind.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=bored,I really wasn't interested in it, but alright, then.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Divine or not, it's a bit of a cheat.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=awkward,How does one bond with a sword, exactly?  ...Stupid question, considering what the Paksis has done to our Dreads...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Reminds me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  Of course, I'd rather forget that evening.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't even think about sharing drinks with her, Jura.  You do enough of that back on the ship.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't you dare touch her beer, Jura.  I know how you get...and Barnette's not around.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,You can strip all you want, Jura, but you're staying sober tonight, you hear me?  Don't join in with this woman.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,We've got a long flight home, Jura...so don't touch Misato's beer.  You don't handle it as well as you think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Jura just carries that for fashion's sake.  Not that it's particularly useful next to a laser ring, anyway...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,We use violence when necessary.  Mejare's government are the real aggressors...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Mejare's military</i> is full of the violent types you're looking for.  We fight to survive.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,Swords are too heavy.  They'd just weigh me down in combat...like I keep telling Jura to remember.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,A pilot has little use for a sword.  Even our ground raids usually end far too quickly to get in close.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...You're certainly trusting.  I suppose you can tell how Jura's not actually very skilled with that thing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Done what?  Should I not have said that?  I don't--<i>oh</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,What do you mean, Mahiru?  Is she--o-oh no, you don't have to.  It's fine.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Does Chiaki really like video games that much?  Does--oh.  Oh dear.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,<i>Now I've done it</i>?  What do you me--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  Uh...please don't.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Are you drinking?  ...Don't even think about joining her, Jura.  I'm not carrying you out of here.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Men are nothing to be afraid of, Florina.  Most are simpletons, anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Listen.  I've helped stage raids on Tarak's military.  Men are easily dealt with.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,You don't have to be afraid of men, Florina.  They probably relish that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,You've got to assert yourself around men.  They'll try to lord themselves over you otherwise.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,Who--you--I--you don't even seem all that concerned.  What's going on with you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...Is this another strange Earth experiment?  Launch!  Explain yourself!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Am I just supposed to accept that this happens to Earth women?  What's going on, Launch?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...You seem like this has happened before.  That's good--now explain it to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,...You seem to be referencing things, but I have no idea what they are.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'll be honest.  Half the time I have no clue what you're referring to when you speak.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm really out of my element here.  I suppose an Earth woman would better understand what you're always referencing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=bored,...<i>What</i> are you always talking about?  You seem to be speaking <i>around</i> us more than <i>to</i> us.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,I--I really didn't...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...You don't have to do that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...I really wasn't that curious.  Please don't start...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...Oh, dear.  I just lit a fire, didn't I?

0-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,...At least you're passionate about it.
0-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,What's "1983"?  I have no context for Earth years, Chiaki.
0-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,...Would you like it if I started rattling off my Dread's specifications?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,Why do you wear all that, anyway?  It just looks cumbersome...I'd lose track of it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I'd be tripping over that dress if I wore it...and I'd get those accessories caught on things.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,You look perfectly fine without all those accessories on.  Why not just go around like that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,You've no need for anything beyond what you're wearing now.  Might even be worth cutting the dress closer, just for ease of movement.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Perfect.  <i>Two</i> drunks running around.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Well, now it's a race to see who blacks out first.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=disappointed,Jura can drink for a while.  I suppose we'll see if Earth booze is powerful enough to topple you two.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Soldiers, exotic hair, alcoholics.  It's like watching a stranger look in a mirror.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's got the height to down those drinks.  Don't ask me how <i>Sei's</i> doing it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's just drinking beer.  Sei's hard liquor is something else entirely.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=annoyed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,You just seem the type that people would take advantage of...until you have nowhere to go but places like this.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,...I spent my teenage years in bars and alleyways, too.  I don't want anyone else going through that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,You just don't look like you want to be here.  I hate to see a woman alone in a seedy place...

0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=impressed,What's wrong?  Your figure is fine.  I assume being a "hero" keeps you in shape...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=bored,Why would you be ashamed of your body?  Maybe Earth women are more modest...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,But then...oh, right.  You were tricked into coming here, yes?  I was dragged...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look fine, Ochako.  Don't let others put you down about a figure you've worked for.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Why are you so angry, Kyu?  Why would they take off anything bigger?
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Surely you don't expect us to take anything bigger off before we have to, Kyu.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=bored,Not everyone's thrilled to be publicly naked, Kyu.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Stop yelling, Kyu.  Not everyone is here because they wanted to be.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Can't you just take off your damn clothes?  Honestly.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Why even play if you're not going to follow the rules?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,For God's sake...this is preposterous.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I got dragged here.  You don't see <i>me</i> making a fuss about stripping.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,And you seemed so unassuming...just an embarrassed girl.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=awkward,Seems that outfit should have tipped me off about you...but it's rather normal on Mejare.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,How could such a flustered girl be hiding away incredible powers like that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed,To levitate under your own power...I need a ship to do it.  And you seemed so innocent...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...I'm done with you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Er...alright then.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,...Whatever you just did, can't you actually <i>strip</i>?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I wouldn't call that <i>stripping</i>...or part of the physical realm, for that matter.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I can't believe what I'm looking at.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Sorry if this is forward, but...you're very fit.  It's impressive.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Can't believe you came to this game already showing off your muscles.  They're something else, too...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,What kind of exercise do you do?  Your abs are toned...I'd like to get that fit.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Certainly doesn't <i>look</i> like you wear much.  Your abs are showing...and they're hard to ignore.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=calm,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=impressed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.

1-male_removing_accessory=calm,...
1-male_removing_accessory=bored,I know so little about men, yet you manage to bore me.
1-male_removing_accessory=bored,Thoroughly by-the-book.
1-male_removing_accessory=disappointed,Sticking to the battle plan, I see.
1-male_removing_accessory=bored,Riveting.
1-male_removing_accessory=bored,Never has a man bored me before.  Congratulations.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Whatever that item is, it's rather decorative for Tarakkian men...the common citizens, anyway.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is that military attire?  Tarakkian soldiers' garb can get rather decorative...but <i>only</i> the soldiers.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your outfit is decorative for a man.  Tarakkians tend to wear rags.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Must be thin fabric, then.  Why even wear it?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've just lost, so not sure I accept that.  But why are you wearing the blindfold, then?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...So what's your reasoning for wearing it?  Some kind of Earth fashion statement?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Care to explain that?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,See <i>better</i>?  I'd like an explanation for that...and why you wear it in the first place.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=confused,You're a strange specimen.  Male, wings, living in the sky?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,You live in the sky, was it?  There's a lot more to the universe than that.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's an "angel," exactly?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  You could try to act that way, then.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,Then I suggest you stop leering at me like a killer.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I consider men in general to be a threat, so maybe it's just my nerves.  I invite you to convince me of that.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Then stop carrying yourself like one.  This game is uncomfortable enough already.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,I <i>would</i> like to look you in the eyes.  Men are mysterious enough without being mechanical.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You <i>do</i> have functioning eyes, yes?  Or did your creators not bother with those?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,You seem uneasy about this.  Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around women?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=addressing,For a man to be so uncomfortable around women...you really <i>are</i> a model Tarakkian.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=bored,Get over yourself.  I didn't know any men until I was nineteen, and you don't see <i>me</i> all bent out of shape.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,As far as I can tell, anyway.  You're male, right, Corrin?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,We don't have the best track record with spotting disguised men, so honesty about your sex would be helpful.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,As you can see, we're not very experienced in telling men and women apart.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Give him some space...it's probably embarrassing.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
1-male_removed_accessory=bored,This is like Pyoro talking in my ear...
1-male_removed_accessory=bored,I don't have all night.  Why would a man doll himself up?
1-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,I <i>do</i> have responsibilities tomorrow, you know.
1-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,If you've no attachment to that, Dita would want it for her man-collection.
1-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,A woman I understand, but a <i>man</i> wearing accessories?
1-male_removed_accessory=bored,Tarakkians don't even wear accessories.  Well, maybe military decorations.
1-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=awkward,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=bored,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Glad you took it in stride.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...I would've preferred it if you focused on flirting with women, if anyone.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Sex is no obstacle for your affections, is it?  Good to know...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Should I tell Barnette you're flirting with <i>men</i> now, too?  Actually, she probably already knows...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=impressed,...Your clothing has a visual feed?  Earth really <i>is</i> more advanced...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm going to stop asking questions.  Apparently Earth technology is beyond my grasp...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm not sure if that counts as cheating.  Why not just use your eyes?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I have a visual feed, too.  It's called my eyes.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look like you've got a lot on your mind...and that it's not going to stay there.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Small, talkative, male.  You and Hibiki might as well be...what's the word?  <i>Brothers</i>?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,This is going to be a long game if you're going to talk this much.
1-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,Your "~clothing~"...interesting accessories Earth women wear.
1-female_removing_accessory=thinking,As a pirate, one tends to forgo what accessories she can...
1-female_removing_accessory=bored,Only your ~clothing~?  Get into the spirit of things.
1-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,What is the purpose of all these accessories?
1-female_removing_accessory=thinking,All those accessories...our crew can be touchy about vanity at times.
1-female_removing_accessory=calm,...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,...Right.  Forgot who I was talking to.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,...You're right, that was stupid of me to say.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,...You're full of surprises.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Should've known this sort of thing is <i>your</i> arena.  Shame a dogfight isn't.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,I still wouldn't call that <i>exciting</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,They might be fashionable, but that doesn't mean much when it's all coming off anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Only <i>you</i> could be so excited to strip that you've based your strategy around it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,Try not to fall over.  Wouldn't be the first time.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that didn't last long.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that's <i>one</i> down.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Looks like men have a use after all...thinning the herd.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see.  And what is this "Flame Tribe"?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,Just making conversation...I'm not interested in fashion.  But what's this Flame Tribe, exactly?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I'm assuming you belong to this "Flame Tribe"?  That sounds interesting.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,...I <i>knew</i> you'd do this, and it's <i>still</i> getting tiresome.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=unimpressed,True to a pirate's nature, you've stolen precious time from all of our lives.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,Unless Earth women are big on jewelry, this feels more like cruelty than teasing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Apologize to <i>them</i>, not me.  I see you naked in the showers...mostly because you make me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,The point of my suit is functionality.  It doesn't encumber me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Are you saying you wear that for fun?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,My suit is standard-issue.  I don't get to complain about comfort.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "tiara"?  ...Must be that jewelry.  Why do you wear it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your tiara...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  Wherever it is you live.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=confused,Is that tiara what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just for decoration?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=bored,Does that have any value?  ...No, I'm not going to steal it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't practice enough with your rapier, Jura.  It just weighs you down.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,I--you--<i>don't bring up Kahlua</i>.  We barely know these people.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Don't--don't tell her our life stories, Jura.  Kahlua has nothing to do with this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,If you knew I liked spending time with Kahlua, why didn't you just leave me with <i>her</i> again?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Any charm I had has been crushed by being dragged here...and leave Kahlua out of this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  Well, can't say I'm surprised.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...That's about right for you.  The letter of the rule rather than the spirit.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...Thrilling, Jura.  Good first impression.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...You're lucky we're in mixed company.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=bored,Neither do I...but that's no reason to be ashamed.  I'm not going to let anyone relish it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,Do you think <i>I</i> do?  You look perfectly fit...don't give them the satisfaction of seeing that this bothers you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=addressing,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=confused,Sector...?  Not sure how your federation organizes space, but I come from Mejare.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare.  It's...less than stellar.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=bored,I come from Mejare, the planet of women...not a healthy place.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare, Earth's uterus colony.  What sector it's in is beyond me...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,...Wait, I wasn't sure at first, but--are you <i>levitating</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--wait, how are you levitating like that?  What's going on?  Ochako?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Ochako, why are you floating?  Did I miss something?  I was looking at the cards...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, are you <i>floating</i>?  W-what's this all about, Ochako?  I should have paid more attention...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "crown"?  You seem fancy enough already...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I still don't know what you're supposed to be ruling over.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just your claim to...space?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Does that jewelry mark you as ruler of your observatory?  Wherever it is in space?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  I thought it was Jura at first, but no, it's you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,What's wrong?  It's just a belt.  Are you alright?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=awkward,If you're so shy, maybe you shouldn't be playing this...I don't want to see a woman all broken up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,...Don't ask me how you're going to get all the way down to nude.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,I'll just hope you manage to win.  Stripping looks physicially painful for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,I don't even <i>want</i> to beat you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,Not <i>again</i>.  Why are you doing this?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Oh, great.  Another vortex.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=impressed,The people you meet in these sorts of seedy dumps...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,Ugh...not <i>again</i>.  This is going to give me a headache.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I should've known you'd threaten me just for saying that.  You're a walking stereotype.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=awkward,...Listen, I'm not the most talkative woman myself, but you look absolutely miserable.  Don't suffer quietly...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're blushing, Saki.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Your defensiveness still leaves me in doubt.  You can tell me if something's wrong.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...My pilots lie to me all the time, Saki.  And they're better liars than you are.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Saki, look.  I can tell when someone is distressed.  It's part of my job.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
1-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=unimpressed,Can't it?  You seem to be doing a good job.
1-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=annoyed,I'm telling you, <i>I don't know</i> what "Super Mario" is.  Slow down.
1-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,I've made it twenty years without knowing about it, so I think it's not all that important.
1-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,...Why are you doing this to me?  I was just being polite...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Wha--what are you...</i>
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,...Vriska?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,V-Vriska?  What's...<i>happening</i> to you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,...<i>Vriska</i>?  <i>Vriska</i>!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,There's no reason for that.  Bodysuits are slim and practical...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,What's wrong with the way you are now?  You look good, and it stays out of your way.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose heroes don't have much more choice in their outfits than pirates do...but bodysuits are good to have.  I'd never complain about mine.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's too bad...still, I would recommend keeping the suit.  They've always served me well...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=confused,What exactly is <i>Jerusalem</i>?  A man's name?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=bored,I understand spiders' importance.  I still don't like them.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders,marker:riches_to_rags=disappointed,I've lived in apartments infested with spiders.  You'll have to forgive my distaste for them.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Oh, it's that...jewelry.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I don't like politics...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  A woman who relies on a title should rethink her identity.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=annoyed,Jewelry marking your inflated importance...politics disgust me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>Words</i>, huh?  Sounds nice, but I'd like to see you try to reason with Mejarian imperials.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't be so high and mighty.  If you're capable of fighting evil, you're capable of perpetrating it, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Can't you give me a straight answer?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...I see.  I'm afraid my piracy is limited to the material.  How do you do this?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...Is that so?  We tend to steal...food, fuel, and weapons.  What are your methods?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...You really don't seem the type, but that's...fascinating.  How exactly do you achieve that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,Uh...that doesn't sound like it would help people.  Maybe you could elaborate?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  I was watching that from the beginning.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,You seemed the type to leave that on just to lure people into a false sense of security.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=pleased,Smart to leave that on until now.  Some of us probably got complacent...I've tried not to.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Clever.  But don't think I hadn't noticed that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're starting the exhibitionism a little early, don't you think?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you exposing yourself on purpose?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Perhaps presenting like that will prepare us for the nudity to come.  Considerate of you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Kyu, you're...showing.  Actually, you probably know that, don't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Is it the only thing that symbolizes your title?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I'm not following the politics here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=calm,A "crown"?  You've no need for titles or jewelry, Daisy.  You should be an athlete...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless...<i>you</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,God bless you--er...Launch?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--where's Launch?  Who are you?  What just happened?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless you--uh...<i>Launch</i>?  Your hair is...blue now.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,O-oh no, I don't want to be a bother...my build doesn't even compare.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,N-no, you don't have to, Chun-Li.  I was just being complimentary...you look much better than I do.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-tips?  I don't want to impose.  And I certainly don't stack up to you...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-that's not necessary...I just need to work harder, I'm sure.  There's no need to compliment me, with the way you look...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't have money.  I was just making conversation.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I'm happy to discuss the finer points of piloting, but you're mistaken if you think I was making an offer...or have money at all.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I wasn't looking for a business transaction.  My crew doesn't use money regardless.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I see money is primarily how you operate, then.  My crew has none...and you can forget I said anything.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Jura has a sword like that...but she doesn't practice enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,The typical response of a woman with something to hide.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your sudden panic is very convincing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...The least you could do is make an effort to convince me of that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  That's obvious from the worry on your face.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'd like to know more about these "video games."  They sound interesting, if impractical.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about these "video games" sounds familiar...like a lot of the women here would know them, at least.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=pleased,Parfet's good with computers.  Maybe she'd like "video games" like you do...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=bored,"Video games" honestly sound like our flight simulations.  Never liked those...not real enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,So, do you play these "video games" of yours in school?  Sounds better than Mejarian propaganda classes.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,Finally putting down those ridiculous kinetic weapons.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,I couldn't care less about those things...now that they're gone.  I feel obligated to give you a laser ring.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I'm a pirate.  So I have to deal with military types on a regular basis.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare's military isn't known for its commitment to human rights.  So I work with pirates.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I guess that was presumptuous of me.  I don't know what Earth's military is like, but Mejare's is corrupt.  I'm a pirate...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I pilot for a pirate crew to stage raids on Mejare's military.  So I'm not fond of them, considering the crewmates of mine they've killed.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Rude?  You're awfully defensive after some honest comments.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,At least you love your home planet.  Quiz me on Mejare.  I won't pull any punches.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,...So is a "country" some kind of special planet I should know about?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,..At least you didn't cling to it.  Then I'd <i>really</i> be worried.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Thanks.  But it's common on Mejare.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Blue hair is run-of-the-mill on Mejare.  There's prettier faces underneath than mine.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Matches my eyes?  If you say so.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=thinking,...Thank you.  Yours is nice, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  As in, like Jura.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2-3,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=addressing,It covers everything, but it hides nothing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=calm,Don't be ashamed.  It's a perfectly sensible choice.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Bodysuits are comfortable and efficient, but they leave nothing to the imagination.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Your whole figure is on display, Marinette.  Of course, on Mejare, no one minds.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Management?  Who's watching us play this?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm so confused.  Are you some kind of repeat offender?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=bored,I don't <i>like</i> my armor so much as I <i>need</i> it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,Tomatoes?  That would fly over a Tarakkian's head.  They only eat synthetic pellets.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,If not for my responsibilities, actually, I'd probably wear a sundress.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Whether or not you are, you seem awfully touchy about it...not what I would expect from a deity.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do people question your divinity often?  You seem defensive for someone so above us mere mortals.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,Surely a goddess would feel secure enough not to worry about a mortal's accusations.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,You may have the power of a goddess, but it seems your ego is all too human.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,I've seen enough of the supernatural to believe you, but I figured a goddess would be more...secure.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see.  People say I don't laugh enough, so maybe you'll be of assistance there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm not known among the crew for my sense of humor, but I invite you to try.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=bored,Hm.  Never had a stable job myself...well, not one they pay me for.  But if you could make me laugh, I welcome it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking,I certainly don't want to be here, so if that's true...I could use a laugh.
1-female_removed_accessory=calm,...
1-female_removed_accessory=thinking,I've already lost everything you might call an "accessory."
1-female_removed_accessory=bored,Perhaps I should have borrowed a few trinkets from Jura before coming here...
1-female_removed_accessory=bored,We've got a long way to go...should have stayed on the ship.
1-female_removed_accessory=disappointed,Why wear what has no meaning to you?
1-female_removed_accessory=disappointed,Smart, but hardly exciting.  Like Parfet.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Can't you just take off your damn clothes?  Honestly.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Why even play if you're not going to follow the rules?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,For God's sake...this is preposterous.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I got dragged here.  You don't see <i>me</i> making a fuss about stripping.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,...You seem to be referencing things, but I have no idea what they are.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'll be honest.  Half the time I have no clue what you're referring to when you speak.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm really out of my element here.  I suppose an Earth woman would better understand what you're always referencing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=bored,...<i>What</i> are you always talking about?  You seem to be speaking <i>around</i> us more than <i>to</i> us.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,...This is the last time I try to make small talk about an Earth woman's interests.
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,And Jura wonders why I don't bother talking to people...
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,...At least you're passionate about it.
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,What's "1983"?  I have no context for Earth years, Chiaki.
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,...Would you like it if I started rattling off my Dread's specifications?
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,Ah, yes.  The <i>enn-ee-ess</i>.  That explains everything.  Thanks, Chiaki.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,Just from looking at you, you don't have a body to be ashamed of.  It's no issue...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=impressed,What's wrong?  Your figure is fine.  I assume being a "hero" keeps you in shape...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=bored,Why would you be ashamed of your body?  Maybe Earth women are more modest...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,But then...oh, right.  You were tricked into coming here, yes?  I was dragged...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look fine, Ochako.  Don't let others put you down about a figure you've worked for.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,Birth...control?  What's that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,...If it makes you feel better, Blake, you still look nice.  I'm sorry about your ears...whatever the reason is that you hid them.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,Oh, for God's sake...your feet are fine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Yes.  Your feet are beautiful, like the rest of you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=unimpressed,As if you need my approval to pad your vanity.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,If you want me to pay you compliments, show up to flight practice early.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=surprised-horny,Wha--you can't--you're not serious?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=impressed,N-no underwear?  That's a little much even for <i>you</i>, Jura.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=surprised-horny,You're not <i>serious</i>?  Have some decency...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I refuse to believe that, however skimpy it may be.  I'm in a <i>bodysuit</i> and I wear underwear.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=unimpressed,This is getting ridiculous...obviously you don't wear a bra, but nothing to cover your <i>groin</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I really wasn't interested.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I know what panties look like.  Put your skirt down.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I think you're the only one demanding your panties be shown.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,...Good to know you're not as modest as you look.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,I--I really didn't...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...You don't have to do that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...I really wasn't that curious.  Please don't start...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...Oh, dear.  I just lit a fire, didn't I?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,And you seemed so unassuming...just an embarrassed girl.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=awkward,Seems that outfit should have tipped me off about you...but it's rather normal on Mejare.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,How could such a flustered girl be hiding away incredible powers like that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed,To levitate under your own power...I need a ship to do it.  And you seemed so innocent...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,All the same, I'd appreciate it if you didn't show up to flight practice fifteen minutes late.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,You'll have to excuse me for being concerned about a pilot whose first priority is her makeup.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,How you do one thing is how you do everything.  You've got to bring focus with you wherever you go.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=bored,You can't blame me for being concerned.  You're usually playing with your hair when I check your status.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=annoyed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,...Well, you know <i>I'm</i> out of accessories.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,The one small thing I have is gone already...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Wish I had all the little things <i>you</i> do...it'd really help here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Must be nice having a bunch of little things to lose...you know good and well my eyepiece was it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Men are nothing to be afraid of, Florina.  Most are simpletons, anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Listen.  I've helped stage raids on Tarak's military.  Men are easily dealt with.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,You don't have to be afraid of men, Florina.  They probably relish that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,You've got to assert yourself around men.  They'll try to lord themselves over you otherwise.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=calm,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=impressed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Perfect.  <i>Two</i> drunks running around.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Well, now it's a race to see who blacks out first.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=disappointed,Jura can drink for a while.  I suppose we'll see if Earth booze is powerful enough to topple you two.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Soldiers really <i>are</i> irresponsible.  What are the odds they're <i>both</i> drunks?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Unbelievable.  Two soldiers, both irresponsible alcoholics.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Soldiers, exotic hair, alcoholics.  It's like watching a stranger look in a mirror.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's got the height to down those drinks.  Don't ask me how <i>Sei's</i> doing it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's just drinking beer.  Sei's hard liquor is something else entirely.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Reminds me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  Of course, I'd rather forget that evening.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Drinking is disgusting...I would know.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,You have a nice figure, Misato.  Don't ruin it with booze.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Despite the alcohol, I guess you still have the professionalism to work for this "NERV," whatever it is.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Drinking...it's the sort of thing I'd <i>expect</i> from a military woman.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...I'm done with you.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,I've already lost everything you might call an "accessory."
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Perhaps I should have dug through your closet for a few trinkets before coming here, Jura.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,We've got a long way to go...should have stayed on the ship.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Why wear what has no meaning to you?
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Smart, but hardly exciting.  Like Parfet.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Are you drinking?  ...Don't even think about joining her, Jura.  I'm not carrying you out of here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm willing to believe it.  But actions speak louder than words...especially for an Earthling.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'll just be quiet and let your behavior speak for itself, Misato.  But Earthlings put me on edge already.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll keep that in mind, Misato.  I'm already wary of Earthlings in general.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,I haven't had positive experiences with Earthlings, either...so a soldier just alerts me even further.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3-4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Done what?  Should I not have said that?  I don't--<i>oh</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,What do you mean, Mahiru?  Is she--o-oh no, you don't have to.  It's fine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Does Chiaki really like video games that much?  Does--oh.  Oh dear.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,<i>Now I've done it</i>?  What do you me--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  Uh...please don't.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Jura just carries that for fashion's sake.  Not that it's particularly useful next to a laser ring, anyway...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,We use violence when necessary.  Mejare's government are the real aggressors...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Mejare's military</i> is full of the violent types you're looking for.  We fight to survive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,Swords are too heavy.  They'd just weigh me down in combat...like I keep telling Jura to remember.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,A pilot has little use for a sword.  Even our ground raids usually end far too quickly to get in close.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...You're certainly trusting.  I suppose you can tell how Jura's not actually very skilled with that thing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't even think about sharing drinks with her, Jura.  You do enough of that back on the ship.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't you dare touch her beer, Jura.  I know how you get...and Barnette's not around.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,You can strip all you want, Jura, but you're staying sober tonight, you hear me?  Don't join in with this woman.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,We've got a long flight home, Jura...so don't touch Misato's beer.  You don't handle it as well as you think.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Why are you so angry, Kyu?  Why would they take off anything bigger?
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Surely you don't expect us to take anything bigger off before we have to, Kyu.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=bored,Not everyone's thrilled to be publicly naked, Kyu.
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Stop yelling, Kyu.  Not everyone is here because they wanted to be.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I see.  I'll keep that divinity in mind.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=bored,I really wasn't interested in it, but alright, then.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Divine or not, it's a bit of a cheat.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=awkward,How does one bond with a sword, exactly?  ...Stupid question, considering what the Paksis has done to our Dreads...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Sorry if this is forward, but...you're very fit.  It's impressive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Can't believe you came to this game already showing off your muscles.  They're something else, too...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,What kind of exercise do you do?  Your abs are toned...I'd like to get that fit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Certainly doesn't <i>look</i> like you wear much.  Your abs are showing...and they're hard to ignore.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,You just seem the type that people would take advantage of...until you have nowhere to go but places like this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,...I spent my teenage years in bars and alleyways, too.  I don't want anyone else going through that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,You just don't look like you want to be here.  I hate to see a woman alone in a seedy place...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,It's my job to worry about women...especially ones who look like they don't belong.  Don't you have a home?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Er...alright then.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,...Whatever you just did, can't you actually <i>strip</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I wouldn't call that <i>stripping</i>...or part of the physical realm, for that matter.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I can't believe what I'm looking at.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,Who--you--I--you don't even seem all that concerned.  What's going on with you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...Is this another strange Earth experiment?  Launch!  Explain yourself!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Am I just supposed to accept that this happens to Earth women?  What's going on, Launch?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...You seem like this has happened before.  That's good--now explain it to me.

2-male_removing_accessory=unimpressed,You'd think men's accessories would be fascinating...but they're not.
2-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,I'm already down to my bodysuit.  Didn't think men were capable of being cheeky.
2-male_removing_accessory=unimpressed,Cheeky.
2-male_removing_accessory=bored,As annoying as this is, it's my own fault...
2-male_removing_accessory=disappointed,...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Whatever that item is, it's rather decorative for Tarakkian men...the common citizens, anyway.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is that military attire?  Tarakkian soldiers' garb can get rather decorative...but <i>only</i> the soldiers.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your outfit is decorative for a man.  Tarakkians tend to wear rags.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,You seem uneasy about this.  Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around women?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=addressing,For a man to be so uncomfortable around women...you really <i>are</i> a model Tarakkian.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=bored,Get over yourself.  I didn't know any men until I was nineteen, and you don't see <i>me</i> all bent out of shape.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  You could try to act that way, then.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,Then I suggest you stop leering at me like a killer.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I consider men in general to be a threat, so maybe it's just my nerves.  I invite you to convince me of that.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Then stop carrying yourself like one.  This game is uncomfortable enough already.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,I <i>would</i> like to look you in the eyes.  Men are mysterious enough without being mechanical.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You <i>do</i> have functioning eyes, yes?  Or did your creators not bother with those?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=confused,You're a strange specimen.  Male, wings, living in the sky?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,You live in the sky, was it?  There's a lot more to the universe than that.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's an "angel," exactly?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,As far as I can tell, anyway.  You're male, right, Corrin?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,We don't have the best track record with spotting disguised men, so honesty about your sex would be helpful.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,As you can see, we're not very experienced in telling men and women apart.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Give him some space...it's probably embarrassing.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Must be thin fabric, then.  Why even wear it?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've just lost, so not sure I accept that.  But why are you wearing the blindfold, then?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...So what's your reasoning for wearing it?  Some kind of Earth fashion statement?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Care to explain that?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,See <i>better</i>?  I'd like an explanation for that...and why you wear it in the first place.
2-male_removed_accessory=calm,Duero's smart enough to play poker, but he barely wears more than his labcoat.
2-male_removed_accessory=addressing,You'd best protect that lead of yours...or you'll be protecting other areas.
2-male_removed_accessory=bored,I don't like waiting around...especially for a man.
2-male_removed_accessory=bored,I should have taken tonight's patrol duty...
2-male_removed_accessory=bored,Say what you want about Hibiki...he doesn't waste any time.
2-male_removed_accessory=pleased,Men from Tarak certainly wouldn't waste their time with accessories.  Well, maybe Bart.
2-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,At least Tarakkians don't dress as wastefully as Earth men.
2-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look like you've got a lot on your mind...and that it's not going to stay there.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Small, talkative, male.  You and Hibiki might as well be...what's the word?  <i>Brothers</i>?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,This is going to be a long game if you're going to talk this much.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Glad you took it in stride.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...I would've preferred it if you focused on flirting with women, if anyone.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Sex is no obstacle for your affections, is it?  Good to know...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Should I tell Barnette you're flirting with <i>men</i> now, too?  Actually, she probably already knows...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=awkward,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=bored,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=impressed,...Your clothing has a visual feed?  Earth really <i>is</i> more advanced...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm going to stop asking questions.  Apparently Earth technology is beyond my grasp...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm not sure if that counts as cheating.  Why not just use your eyes?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I have a visual feed, too.  It's called my eyes.
2-female_removing_accessory=bored,We're all just beating around the bush with these sorts of accessories...
2-female_removing_accessory=unimpressed,The tension is palpable.
2-female_removing_accessory=bored,Perhaps discussing fashion with Jura is more your speed than poker is.
2-female_removing_accessory=bored,I should have brought my laser ring...
2-female_removing_accessory=unimpressed,Give me a break...
2-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Is it the only thing that symbolizes your title?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I'm not following the politics here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=calm,A "crown"?  You've no need for titles or jewelry, Daisy.  You should be an athlete...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Jura has a sword like that...but she doesn't practice enough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless...<i>you</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,God bless you--er...Launch?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--where's Launch?  Who are you?  What just happened?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless you--uh...<i>Launch</i>?  Your hair is...blue now.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  I was watching that from the beginning.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,You seemed the type to leave that on just to lure people into a false sense of security.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=pleased,Smart to leave that on until now.  Some of us probably got complacent...I've tried not to.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Clever.  But don't think I hadn't noticed that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=bored,Neither do I...but that's no reason to be ashamed.  I'm not going to let anyone relish it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,Do you think <i>I</i> do?  You look perfectly fit...don't give them the satisfaction of seeing that this bothers you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=addressing,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=addressing,It covers everything, but it hides nothing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=calm,Don't be ashamed.  It's a perfectly sensible choice.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Bodysuits are comfortable and efficient, but they leave nothing to the imagination.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Your whole figure is on display, Marinette.  Of course, on Mejare, no one minds.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,I--you--<i>don't bring up Kahlua</i>.  We barely know these people.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Don't--don't tell her our life stories, Jura.  Kahlua has nothing to do with this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,If you knew I liked spending time with Kahlua, why didn't you just leave me with <i>her</i> again?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Any charm I had has been crushed by being dragged here...and leave Kahlua out of this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  I thought it was Jura at first, but no, it's you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  As in, like Jura.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,We're all just beating around the bush with these sorts of accessories...
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,The tension is palpable.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Seems cards aren't your speed.  Take her outside for a fashion discussion instead, Jura.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I should have brought my laser ring...
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Give me a break...
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,...Wait, I wasn't sure at first, but--are you <i>levitating</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--wait, how are you levitating like that?  What's going on?  Ochako?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Ochako, why are you floating?  Did I miss something?  I was looking at the cards...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, are you <i>floating</i>?  W-what's this all about, Ochako?  I should have paid more attention...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Rude?  You're awfully defensive after some honest comments.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,At least you love your home planet.  Quiz me on Mejare.  I won't pull any punches.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,...So is a "country" some kind of special planet I should know about?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,O-oh no, I don't want to be a bother...my build doesn't even compare.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,N-no, you don't have to, Chun-Li.  I was just being complimentary...you look much better than I do.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-tips?  I don't want to impose.  And I certainly don't stack up to you...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-that's not necessary...I just need to work harder, I'm sure.  There's no need to compliment me, with the way you look...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'd like to know more about these "video games."  They sound interesting, if impractical.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about these "video games" sounds familiar...like a lot of the women here would know them, at least.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=pleased,Parfet's good with computers.  Maybe she'd like "video games" like you do...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=bored,"Video games" honestly sound like our flight simulations.  Never liked those...not real enough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,So, do you play these "video games" of yours in school?  Sounds better than Mejarian propaganda classes.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I'm a pirate.  So I have to deal with military types on a regular basis.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare's military isn't known for its commitment to human rights.  So I work with pirates.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I guess that was presumptuous of me.  I don't know what Earth's military is like, but Mejare's is corrupt.  I'm a pirate...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I pilot for a pirate crew to stage raids on Mejare's military.  So I'm not fond of them, considering the crewmates of mine they've killed.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't have money.  I was just making conversation.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I'm happy to discuss the finer points of piloting, but you're mistaken if you think I was making an offer...or have money at all.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I wasn't looking for a business transaction.  My crew doesn't use money regardless.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I see money is primarily how you operate, then.  My crew has none...and you can forget I said anything.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I should've known you'd threaten me just for saying that.  You're a walking stereotype.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Management?  Who's watching us play this?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm so confused.  Are you some kind of repeat offender?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,There's no reason for that.  Bodysuits are slim and practical...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,What's wrong with the way you are now?  You look good, and it stays out of your way.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose heroes don't have much more choice in their outfits than pirates do...but bodysuits are good to have.  I'd never complain about mine.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's too bad...still, I would recommend keeping the suit.  They've always served me well...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>Words</i>, huh?  Sounds nice, but I'd like to see you try to reason with Mejarian imperials.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't be so high and mighty.  If you're capable of fighting evil, you're capable of perpetrating it, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Can't you give me a straight answer?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,The typical response of a woman with something to hide.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your sudden panic is very convincing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...The least you could do is make an effort to convince me of that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  That's obvious from the worry on your face.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're starting the exhibitionism a little early, don't you think?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you exposing yourself on purpose?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Perhaps presenting like that will prepare us for the nudity to come.  Considerate of you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Kyu, you're...showing.  Actually, you probably know that, don't you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,..At least you didn't cling to it.  Then I'd <i>really</i> be worried.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...I see.  I'm afraid my piracy is limited to the material.  How do you do this?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...Is that so?  We tend to steal...food, fuel, and weapons.  What are your methods?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...You really don't seem the type, but that's...fascinating.  How exactly do you achieve that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,Uh...that doesn't sound like it would help people.  Maybe you could elaborate?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,Not <i>again</i>.  Why are you doing this?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Oh, great.  Another vortex.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=impressed,The people you meet in these sorts of seedy dumps...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,Ugh...not <i>again</i>.  This is going to give me a headache.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "crown"?  You seem fancy enough already...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I still don't know what you're supposed to be ruling over.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just your claim to...space?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Does that jewelry mark you as ruler of your observatory?  Wherever it is in space?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,What's wrong?  It's just a belt.  Are you alright?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=awkward,If you're so shy, maybe you shouldn't be playing this...I don't want to see a woman all broken up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,...Don't ask me how you're going to get all the way down to nude.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,I'll just hope you manage to win.  Stripping looks physicially painful for you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,I don't even <i>want</i> to beat you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that didn't last long.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that's <i>one</i> down.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Looks like men have a use after all...thinning the herd.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Wha--what are you...</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,...Vriska?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,V-Vriska?  What's...<i>happening</i> to you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,...<i>Vriska</i>?  <i>Vriska</i>!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see.  And what is this "Flame Tribe"?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,Just making conversation...I'm not interested in fashion.  But what's this Flame Tribe, exactly?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I'm assuming you belong to this "Flame Tribe"?  That sounds interesting.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "tiara"?  ...Must be that jewelry.  Why do you wear it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your tiara...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  Wherever it is you live.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=confused,Is that tiara what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just for decoration?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=bored,Does that have any value?  ...No, I'm not going to steal it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Thanks.  But it's common on Mejare.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Blue hair is run-of-the-mill on Mejare.  There's prettier faces underneath than mine.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Matches my eyes?  If you say so.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=thinking,...Thank you.  Yours is nice, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,The point of my suit is functionality.  It doesn't encumber me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Are you saying you wear that for fun?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,My suit is standard-issue.  I don't get to complain about comfort.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,Finally putting down those ridiculous kinetic weapons.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,I couldn't care less about those things...now that they're gone.  I feel obligated to give you a laser ring.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...Well, I can see how beating you is going to be an issue.  That's not even clothing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,It's called <i>Strip</i> Poker, not <i>Disarm</i> Poker.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Oh, great.  <i>This</i> sort of thing was what you had planned...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...I don't know why I expected you to follow anything but the letter of the rules.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,Should've figured you'd just tease instead of take the game seriously.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't practice enough with your rapier, Jura.  It just weighs you down.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Oh, it's that...jewelry.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I don't like politics...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  A woman who relies on a title should rethink her identity.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=annoyed,Jewelry marking your inflated importance...politics disgust me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=confused,Sector...?  Not sure how your federation organizes space, but I come from Mejare.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare.  It's...less than stellar.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=bored,I come from Mejare, the planet of women...not a healthy place.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare, Earth's uterus colony.  What sector it's in is beyond me...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=confused,What exactly is <i>Jerusalem</i>?  A man's name?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=bored,I understand spiders' importance.  I still don't like them.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders,marker:riches_to_rags=disappointed,I've lived in apartments infested with spiders.  You'll have to forgive my distaste for them.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see.  People say I don't laugh enough, so maybe you'll be of assistance there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm not known among the crew for my sense of humor, but I invite you to try.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=bored,Hm.  Never had a stable job myself...well, not one they pay me for.  But if you could make me laugh, I welcome it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking,I certainly don't want to be here, so if that's true...I could use a laugh.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Whether or not you are, you seem awfully touchy about it...not what I would expect from a deity.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do people question your divinity often?  You seem defensive for someone so above us mere mortals.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,Surely a goddess would feel secure enough not to worry about a mortal's accusations.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,You may have the power of a goddess, but it seems your ego is all too human.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,I've seen enough of the supernatural to believe you, but I figured a goddess would be more...secure.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Don't flirt with me.  I was just complimenting your play...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=awkward,...Don't make this weird, Jura.  We're colleagues...and you're taken.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,...I know you flirt with <i>everyone</i>, but it still catches me off guard.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,...Look, don't say those sorts of things.  I know you're joking, but Barnette's still going to get in my face about it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,I figured you wouldn't care.  This is far more exciting for you, after all...and you shy away from leadership opportunities.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Considering your track record, I knew you wouldn't mind losing out on another chance to show leadership.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,For my backup squadron leader, you sure don't have much experience...it leaves me uneasy.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,More teasing aside, you really ought to practice leading the squadron more.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,Tomatoes?  That would fly over a Tarakkian's head.  They only eat synthetic pellets.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,If not for my responsibilities, actually, I'd probably wear a sundress.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=unimpressed,How could I miss it?  It's basically a big warning sign to passersby that you're going to flirt with them.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,I wouldn't congratulate myself for spotting a garish piece of jewelry right on your neck.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=confused,Isn't that thing uncomfortable, on top of being distracting?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=unimpressed,You're not exactly the most subtle woman on Mejare, Jura.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're blushing, Saki.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Your defensiveness still leaves me in doubt.  You can tell me if something's wrong.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...My pilots lie to me all the time, Saki.  And they're better liars than you are.

2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Soldiers really <i>are</i> irresponsible.  What are the odds they're <i>both</i> drunks?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Unbelievable.  Two soldiers, both irresponsible alcoholics.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Soldiers, exotic hair, alcoholics.  It's like watching a stranger look in a mirror.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's got the height to down those drinks.  Don't ask me how <i>Sei's</i> doing it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's just drinking beer.  Sei's hard liquor is something else entirely.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Er...alright then.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,...Whatever you just did, can't you actually <i>strip</i>?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I wouldn't call that <i>stripping</i>...or part of the physical realm, for that matter.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I can't believe what I'm looking at.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'll start having fun when I start winning.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,I don't...<i>like</i> that sort of talk, alright?  Let's just move on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored,I'll drop it for now.  Maybe I'll have more fun if I strip more...hopefully not.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=thinking,I guess we'll see if stripping more puts me at ease...or the total opposite.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,Just take it easy.  She's almost done teasing...because she probably couldn't fit any more jewelry on her person.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I could never wear a choker like that...my armor is restrictive enough.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=thinking,I only own one thing that people might call jewelry...<i>I</i> certainly wouldn't, though.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored,Must be nice, having all those small things in a game like this.  You came prepared...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Are you drinking?  ...Don't even think about joining her, Jura.  I'm not carrying you out of here.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Men are nothing to be afraid of, Florina.  Most are simpletons, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Listen.  I've helped stage raids on Tarak's military.  Men are easily dealt with.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,You don't have to be afraid of men, Florina.  They probably relish that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,You've got to assert yourself around men.  They'll try to lord themselves over you otherwise.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=annoyed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Done what?  Should I not have said that?  I don't--<i>oh</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,What do you mean, Mahiru?  Is she--o-oh no, you don't have to.  It's fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Does Chiaki really like video games that much?  Does--oh.  Oh dear.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,<i>Now I've done it</i>?  What do you me--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  Uh...please don't.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Jura just carries that for fashion's sake.  Not that it's particularly useful next to a laser ring, anyway...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,We use violence when necessary.  Mejare's government are the real aggressors...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Mejare's military</i> is full of the violent types you're looking for.  We fight to survive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,Swords are too heavy.  They'd just weigh me down in combat...like I keep telling Jura to remember.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,A pilot has little use for a sword.  Even our ground raids usually end far too quickly to get in close.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...You're certainly trusting.  I suppose you can tell how Jura's not actually very skilled with that thing.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Why are you so angry, Kyu?  Why would they take off anything bigger?
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Surely you don't expect us to take anything bigger off before we have to, Kyu.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=bored,Not everyone's thrilled to be publicly naked, Kyu.
2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Stop yelling, Kyu.  Not everyone is here because they wanted to be.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't even think about sharing drinks with her, Jura.  You do enough of that back on the ship.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't you dare touch her beer, Jura.  I know how you get...and Barnette's not around.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,You can strip all you want, Jura, but you're staying sober tonight, you hear me?  Don't join in with this woman.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,We've got a long flight home, Jura...so don't touch Misato's beer.  You don't handle it as well as you think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Well, considering you have almost no swordfighting experience, I suppose it just <i>is</i> clothing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,I suppose that rapier <i>is</i> just a fashion item.  You certainly don't know how to make use of it otherwise.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased,You're lucky no one has called your bluff on knowing how to use that thing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,If you wanted to come armed, you should've brought a laser ring.  At least you know how to <i>use</i> that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,At least you admit that you just wear it for fashion's sake.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=calm,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=impressed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,Birth...control?  What's that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,...This is the last time I try to make small talk about an Earth woman's interests.
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,And Jura wonders why I don't bother talking to people...
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,...At least you're passionate about it.
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,What's "1983"?  I have no context for Earth years, Chiaki.
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,...Would you like it if I started rattling off my Dread's specifications?
2-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,Ah, yes.  The <i>enn-ee-ess</i>.  That explains everything.  Thanks, Chiaki.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Reminds me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  Of course, I'd rather forget that evening.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Can't you just take off your damn clothes?  Honestly.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Why even play if you're not going to follow the rules?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,For God's sake...this is preposterous.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I got dragged here.  You don't see <i>me</i> making a fuss about stripping.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Maybe I'd let you lead the squadron if you demonstrated any desire to.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Forgive me for being less than faithful in your leadership when you're usually applying makeup during our formations practice.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,You could've asked to run tonight's patrol instead of dragging me out here to strip in front of strangers, you know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Well, Jura, you tend to spend all your time doing things like <i>this</i> instead of practicing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Drinking is disgusting...I would know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,You have a nice figure, Misato.  Don't ruin it with booze.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Despite the alcohol, I guess you still have the professionalism to work for this "NERV," whatever it is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Drinking...it's the sort of thing I'd <i>expect</i> from a military woman.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,I--I really didn't...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...You don't have to do that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...I really wasn't that curious.  Please don't start...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...Oh, dear.  I just lit a fire, didn't I?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,...You seem to be referencing things, but I have no idea what they are.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'll be honest.  Half the time I have no clue what you're referring to when you speak.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm really out of my element here.  I suppose an Earth woman would better understand what you're always referencing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=bored,...<i>What</i> are you always talking about?  You seem to be speaking <i>around</i> us more than <i>to</i> us.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Sorry if this is forward, but...you're very fit.  It's impressive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Can't believe you came to this game already showing off your muscles.  They're something else, too...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,What kind of exercise do you do?  Your abs are toned...I'd like to get that fit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Certainly doesn't <i>look</i> like you wear much.  Your abs are showing...and they're hard to ignore.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I see.  I'll keep that divinity in mind.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=bored,I really wasn't interested in it, but alright, then.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Divine or not, it's a bit of a cheat.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=awkward,How does one bond with a sword, exactly?  ...Stupid question, considering what the Paksis has done to our Dreads...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,And you seemed so unassuming...just an embarrassed girl.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=awkward,Seems that outfit should have tipped me off about you...but it's rather normal on Mejare.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,How could such a flustered girl be hiding away incredible powers like that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed,To levitate under your own power...I need a ship to do it.  And you seemed so innocent...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,You just seem the type that people would take advantage of...until you have nowhere to go but places like this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,...I spent my teenage years in bars and alleyways, too.  I don't want anyone else going through that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,You just don't look like you want to be here.  I hate to see a woman alone in a seedy place...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,It's my job to worry about women...especially ones who look like they don't belong.  Don't you have a home?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,Just from looking at you, you don't have a body to be ashamed of.  It's no issue...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=impressed,What's wrong?  Your figure is fine.  I assume being a "hero" keeps you in shape...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=bored,Why would you be ashamed of your body?  Maybe Earth women are more modest...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,But then...oh, right.  You were tricked into coming here, yes?  I was dragged...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look fine, Ochako.  Don't let others put you down about a figure you've worked for.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3-4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,Who--you--I--you don't even seem all that concerned.  What's going on with you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...Is this another strange Earth experiment?  Launch!  Explain yourself!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Am I just supposed to accept that this happens to Earth women?  What's going on, Launch?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...You seem like this has happened before.  That's good--now explain it to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,...If it makes you feel better, Blake, you still look nice.  I'm sorry about your ears...whatever the reason is that you hid them.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm willing to believe it.  But actions speak louder than words...especially for an Earthling.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'll just be quiet and let your behavior speak for itself, Misato.  But Earthlings put me on edge already.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll keep that in mind, Misato.  I'm already wary of Earthlings in general.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,I haven't had positive experiences with Earthlings, either...so a soldier just alerts me even further.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I really wasn't interested.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I know what panties look like.  Put your skirt down.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I think you're the only one demanding your panties be shown.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,...Good to know you're not as modest as you look.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...I'm done with you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.

3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,As you can see, we're not very experienced in telling men and women apart.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Give him some space...it's probably embarrassing.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  You could try to act that way, then.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,Then I suggest you stop leering at me like a killer.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I consider men in general to be a threat, so maybe it's just my nerves.  I invite you to convince me of that.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Then stop carrying yourself like one.  This game is uncomfortable enough already.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Must be thin fabric, then.  Why even wear it?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've just lost, so not sure I accept that.  But why are you wearing the blindfold, then?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...So what's your reasoning for wearing it?  Some kind of Earth fashion statement?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Care to explain that?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,See <i>better</i>?  I'd like an explanation for that...and why you wear it in the first place.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Whatever that item is, it's rather decorative for Tarakkian men...the common citizens, anyway.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is that military attire?  Tarakkian soldiers' garb can get rather decorative...but <i>only</i> the soldiers.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your outfit is decorative for a man.  Tarakkians tend to wear rags.
3-male_removed_accessory=addressing,We'll see if you can keep up that smug attitude.
3-male_removed_accessory=pleased,Best shot I've ever taken from a man...besides when Rabat threw Pyoro at me.
3-male_removed_accessory=pleased,Never thought a man would decorate himself...I guess we really <i>are</i> the same species.
3-male_removed_accessory=pleased,Losing to a man...at least I know it's <i>my</i> fault, and not my opponent's skill.
3-male_removed_accessory=addressing,Hibiki's a lot braver than you, even if he <i>is</i> shorter.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Glad you took it in stride.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...I would've preferred it if you focused on flirting with women, if anyone.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Sex is no obstacle for your affections, is it?  Good to know...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Should I tell Barnette you're flirting with <i>men</i> now, too?  Actually, she probably already knows...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=awkward,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=bored,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=impressed,...Your clothing has a visual feed?  Earth really <i>is</i> more advanced...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm going to stop asking questions.  Apparently Earth technology is beyond my grasp...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm not sure if that counts as cheating.  Why not just use your eyes?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I have a visual feed, too.  It's called my eyes.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look like you've got a lot on your mind...and that it's not going to stay there.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Small, talkative, male.  You and Hibiki might as well be...what's the word?  <i>Brothers</i>?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,This is going to be a long game if you're going to talk this much.
3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Just an accessory, as I stand here in my underwear.  I suppose I deserve it.
3-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,That's all you've got in store for us, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,That doesn't look important, so forgive me for being less than impressed.
3-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Just your ~clothing~...only myself to blame.
3-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Mejarian soldiers don't actually wear much more than I do...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Whether or not you are, you seem awfully touchy about it...not what I would expect from a deity.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do people question your divinity often?  You seem defensive for someone so above us mere mortals.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,Surely a goddess would feel secure enough not to worry about a mortal's accusations.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,You may have the power of a goddess, but it seems your ego is all too human.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,I've seen enough of the supernatural to believe you, but I figured a goddess would be more...secure.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=confused,What exactly is <i>Jerusalem</i>?  A man's name?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=bored,I understand spiders' importance.  I still don't like them.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders,marker:riches_to_rags=disappointed,I've lived in apartments infested with spiders.  You'll have to forgive my distaste for them.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Oh, it's that...jewelry.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I don't like politics...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  A woman who relies on a title should rethink her identity.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=annoyed,Jewelry marking your inflated importance...politics disgust me.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,I don't even <i>want</i> to beat you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I should've known you'd threaten me just for saying that.  You're a walking stereotype.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "tiara"?  ...Must be that jewelry.  Why do you wear it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your tiara...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  Wherever it is you live.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=confused,Is that tiara what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just for decoration?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=bored,Does that have any value?  ...No, I'm not going to steal it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  I thought it was Jura at first, but no, it's you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,...Wait, I wasn't sure at first, but--are you <i>levitating</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--wait, how are you levitating like that?  What's going on?  Ochako?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Ochako, why are you floating?  Did I miss something?  I was looking at the cards...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, are you <i>floating</i>?  W-what's this all about, Ochako?  I should have paid more attention...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,The point of my suit is functionality.  It doesn't encumber me.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Are you saying you wear that for fun?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,My suit is standard-issue.  I don't get to complain about comfort.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=awkward,...Listen, I'm not the most talkative woman myself, but you look absolutely miserable.  Don't suffer quietly...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're blushing, Saki.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Your defensiveness still leaves me in doubt.  You can tell me if something's wrong.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...My pilots lie to me all the time, Saki.  And they're better liars than you are.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Saki, look.  I can tell when someone is distressed.  It's part of my job.
3-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=unimpressed,Can't it?  You seem to be doing a good job.
3-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=annoyed,I'm telling you, <i>I don't know</i> what "Super Mario" is.  Slow down.
3-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,I've made it twenty years without knowing about it, so I think it's not all that important.
3-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,...Why are you doing this to me?  I was just being polite...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "crown"?  You seem fancy enough already...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I still don't know what you're supposed to be ruling over.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just your claim to...space?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Does that jewelry mark you as ruler of your observatory?  Wherever it is in space?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,There's no reason for that.  Bodysuits are slim and practical...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,What's wrong with the way you are now?  You look good, and it stays out of your way.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose heroes don't have much more choice in their outfits than pirates do...but bodysuits are good to have.  I'd never complain about mine.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's too bad...still, I would recommend keeping the suit.  They've always served me well...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=confused,Sector...?  Not sure how your federation organizes space, but I come from Mejare.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare.  It's...less than stellar.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=bored,I come from Mejare, the planet of women...not a healthy place.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare, Earth's uterus colony.  What sector it's in is beyond me...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,Not <i>again</i>.  Why are you doing this?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Oh, great.  Another vortex.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=impressed,The people you meet in these sorts of seedy dumps...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,Ugh...not <i>again</i>.  This is going to give me a headache.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't practice enough with your rapier, Jura.  It just weighs you down.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=bored,I don't <i>like</i> my armor so much as I <i>need</i> it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,Tomatoes?  That would fly over a Tarakkian's head.  They only eat synthetic pellets.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,If not for my responsibilities, actually, I'd probably wear a sundress.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see.  And what is this "Flame Tribe"?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,Just making conversation...I'm not interested in fashion.  But what's this Flame Tribe, exactly?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I'm assuming you belong to this "Flame Tribe"?  That sounds interesting.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that didn't last long.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that's <i>one</i> down.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Looks like men have a use after all...thinning the herd.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,..At least you didn't cling to it.  Then I'd <i>really</i> be worried.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Wha--what are you...</i>
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,...Vriska?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,V-Vriska?  What's...<i>happening</i> to you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,...<i>Vriska</i>?  <i>Vriska</i>!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,Finally putting down those ridiculous kinetic weapons.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,I couldn't care less about those things...now that they're gone.  I feel obligated to give you a laser ring.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,What's wrong?  It's just a belt.  Are you alright?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=awkward,If you're so shy, maybe you shouldn't be playing this...I don't want to see a woman all broken up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,...Don't ask me how you're going to get all the way down to nude.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,I'll just hope you manage to win.  Stripping looks physicially painful for you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=bored,Neither do I...but that's no reason to be ashamed.  I'm not going to let anyone relish it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,Do you think <i>I</i> do?  You look perfectly fit...don't give them the satisfaction of seeing that this bothers you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=addressing,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Thanks.  But it's common on Mejare.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Blue hair is run-of-the-mill on Mejare.  There's prettier faces underneath than mine.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Matches my eyes?  If you say so.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=thinking,...Thank you.  Yours is nice, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2-3,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...I see.  I'm afraid my piracy is limited to the material.  How do you do this?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...Is that so?  We tend to steal...food, fuel, and weapons.  What are your methods?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...You really don't seem the type, but that's...fascinating.  How exactly do you achieve that?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,Uh...that doesn't sound like it would help people.  Maybe you could elaborate?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see.  People say I don't laugh enough, so maybe you'll be of assistance there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm not known among the crew for my sense of humor, but I invite you to try.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=bored,Hm.  Never had a stable job myself...well, not one they pay me for.  But if you could make me laugh, I welcome it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking,I certainly don't want to be here, so if that's true...I could use a laugh.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  I was watching that from the beginning.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,You seemed the type to leave that on just to lure people into a false sense of security.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=pleased,Smart to leave that on until now.  Some of us probably got complacent...I've tried not to.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Clever.  But don't think I hadn't noticed that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't have money.  I was just making conversation.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I'm happy to discuss the finer points of piloting, but you're mistaken if you think I was making an offer...or have money at all.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I wasn't looking for a business transaction.  My crew doesn't use money regardless.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I see money is primarily how you operate, then.  My crew has none...and you can forget I said anything.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're starting the exhibitionism a little early, don't you think?

3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=calm,A "crown"?  You've no need for titles or jewelry, Daisy.  You should be an athlete...

3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,N-no, you don't have to, Chun-Li.  I was just being complimentary...you look much better than I do.

3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--where's Launch?  Who are you?  What just happened?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless you--uh...<i>Launch</i>?  Your hair is...blue now.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,The typical response of a woman with something to hide.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your sudden panic is very convincing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...The least you could do is make an effort to convince me of that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  That's obvious from the worry on your face.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Jura has a sword like that...but she doesn't practice enough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>Words</i>, huh?  Sounds nice, but I'd like to see you try to reason with Mejarian imperials.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't be so high and mighty.  If you're capable of fighting evil, you're capable of perpetrating it, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Can't you give me a straight answer?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'd like to know more about these "video games."  They sound interesting, if impractical.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about these "video games" sounds familiar...like a lot of the women here would know them, at least.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=pleased,Parfet's good with computers.  Maybe she'd like "video games" like you do...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=bored,"Video games" honestly sound like our flight simulations.  Never liked those...not real enough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,So, do you play these "video games" of yours in school?  Sounds better than Mejarian propaganda classes.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,I--you--<i>don't bring up Kahlua</i>.  We barely know these people.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Don't--don't tell her our life stories, Jura.  Kahlua has nothing to do with this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,If you knew I liked spending time with Kahlua, why didn't you just leave me with <i>her</i> again?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Any charm I had has been crushed by being dragged here...and leave Kahlua out of this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I'm a pirate.  So I have to deal with military types on a regular basis.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare's military isn't known for its commitment to human rights.  So I work with pirates.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I guess that was presumptuous of me.  I don't know what Earth's military is like, but Mejare's is corrupt.  I'm a pirate...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I pilot for a pirate crew to stage raids on Mejare's military.  So I'm not fond of them, considering the crewmates of mine they've killed.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  As in, like Jura.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,You're counting things like your <i>rapier</i>?  Come on, Jura, we're supposed to be stripping <i>clothes</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Follow the rules, Jura.  That sword doesn't count as clothing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=disappointed,I've lost my entire bodysuit, Jura.  The least you could do is strip actual clothing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...Oh.  So <i>this</i> is how you're going to play.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,I won't pretend spotting your choker was particularly clever of me.  It <i>is</i> just below your face.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,I'm too used to your looks to get distracted.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,If spotting something so obvious made me proud of myself, I wouldn't be here today...my arrogance would've gotten me killed.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,You're not that hard to figure out, Jura.  You wear even your sex life on your sleeve.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,You're not exactly the type to keep secrets, Jura.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Rude?  You're awfully defensive after some honest comments.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,At least you love your home planet.  Quiz me on Mejare.  I won't pull any punches.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,...So is a "country" some kind of special planet I should know about?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=addressing,It covers everything, but it hides nothing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=calm,Don't be ashamed.  It's a perfectly sensible choice.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Bodysuits are comfortable and efficient, but they leave nothing to the imagination.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Your whole figure is on display, Marinette.  Of course, on Mejare, no one minds.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Your accessories are running thin.  I won't be losing for much longer...and I don't appreciate being teased.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,I just felt it appropriate to let our hosts know what's coming next.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,I don't approve of beating around the bush, Jura.  I'd rather cut right through it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,It seemed as if our hosts were getting sick of your teasing, so I didn't let them get their hopes up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=confused,Your...<i>boots</i>?  I know you like them, but do they really mean that much to you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=annoyed,Your <i>boots</i>?  My <i>eyepiece</i> is personal...you just like the fashion element.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I wouldn't consider that <i>personal</i>, Jura.  Not unless someone died to give them to you...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Didn't you steal those off a soldier?  I suppose if you really find the encounter that meaningful...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Management?  Who's watching us play this?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm so confused.  Are you some kind of repeat offender?
3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,You're really throwing me into the brig here...where I belong, apparently.
3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,Well, don't make an event out of it.
3-female_removed_accessory=bored,Maybe I'll just review tomorrow's flight patterns in my head...
3-female_removed_accessory=pleased,How would Parfet fare at this, I wonder?  She's booksmart, but a little obvious.
3-female_removed_accessory=bored,I shouldn't be losing.  I have to rethink things...
3-female_removed_accessory=bored,If you're going to be that boring, I might just up and leave.
3-female_removed_accessory=interested,Being coy just makes me want to defeat you that much more.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Reminds me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  Of course, I'd rather forget that evening.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I see.  I'll keep that divinity in mind.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=bored,I really wasn't interested in it, but alright, then.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Divine or not, it's a bit of a cheat.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=awkward,How does one bond with a sword, exactly?  ...Stupid question, considering what the Paksis has done to our Dreads...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=unimpressed,I was looking forward to keeping pace with you, but apparently you're more interested in showing off your stolen goods.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,I just want a clean game, Jura.  Can't you take this seriously?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,You shouldn't have come armed in the first place...this is just a game, and I'd like to enjoy it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't give the very first impression of yourself as a cheater.  I was hoping to get a good game from you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Sorry if this is forward, but...you're very fit.  It's impressive.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Can't believe you came to this game already showing off your muscles.  They're something else, too...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,What kind of exercise do you do?  Your abs are toned...I'd like to get that fit.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Certainly doesn't <i>look</i> like you wear much.  Your abs are showing...and they're hard to ignore.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...I'm done with you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Perfect.  <i>Two</i> drunks running around.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Well, now it's a race to see who blacks out first.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=disappointed,Jura can drink for a while.  I suppose we'll see if Earth booze is powerful enough to topple you two.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Soldiers really <i>are</i> irresponsible.  What are the odds they're <i>both</i> drunks?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Unbelievable.  Two soldiers, both irresponsible alcoholics.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Soldiers, exotic hair, alcoholics.  It's like watching a stranger look in a mirror.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's got the height to down those drinks.  Don't ask me how <i>Sei's</i> doing it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's just drinking beer.  Sei's hard liquor is something else entirely.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed,I figure no one wants to hear me complain.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,It's not my place as a leader to start complaining.  I leave that to my subordinates.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,You didn't really want me to start whining, did you?  I should've played better to save myself this discomfort.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,I like how cold the ground is.  Keeps my senses sharp.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,You just seem the type that people would take advantage of...until you have nowhere to go but places like this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,...I spent my teenage years in bars and alleyways, too.  I don't want anyone else going through that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,You just don't look like you want to be here.  I hate to see a woman alone in a seedy place...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,It's my job to worry about women...especially ones who look like they don't belong.  Don't you have a home?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Are you drinking?  ...Don't even think about joining her, Jura.  I'm not carrying you out of here.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,Who--you--I--you don't even seem all that concerned.  What's going on with you?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...Is this another strange Earth experiment?  Launch!  Explain yourself!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Am I just supposed to accept that this happens to Earth women?  What's going on, Launch?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...You seem like this has happened before.  That's good--now explain it to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Nothing would please me more than walking out of here without having to expose myself, just to stick it to you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,You won't be seeing me naked tonight...that's the plan, anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,You'll stick to seeing me naked in the showers and like it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Talk is cheap.  Let's keep playing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Done what?  Should I not have said that?  I don't--<i>oh</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,What do you mean, Mahiru?  Is she--o-oh no, you don't have to.  It's fine.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Does Chiaki really like video games that much?  Does--oh.  Oh dear.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,<i>Now I've done it</i>?  What do you me--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  Uh...please don't.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Why are you so angry, Kyu?  Why would they take off anything bigger?
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Surely you don't expect us to take anything bigger off before we have to, Kyu.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=bored,Not everyone's thrilled to be publicly naked, Kyu.
3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Stop yelling, Kyu.  Not everyone is here because they wanted to be.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=disappointed,I'll be having a lot more fun when you're out of my hair for the night.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=addressing,I only have fun when I win...so I guess I'll have to do that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=pleased,You'd be better able to read me than most, I suppose.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=pleased,It's not as if the others knew what to expect from me.  I'm still not sure whether <i>you</i> do.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3-4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't even think about sharing drinks with her, Jura.  You do enough of that back on the ship.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't you dare touch her beer, Jura.  I know how you get...and Barnette's not around.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,You can strip all you want, Jura, but you're staying sober tonight, you hear me?  Don't join in with this woman.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,We've got a long flight home, Jura...so don't touch Misato's beer.  You don't handle it as well as you think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm willing to believe it.  But actions speak louder than words...especially for an Earthling.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'll just be quiet and let your behavior speak for itself, Misato.  But Earthlings put me on edge already.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll keep that in mind, Misato.  I'm already wary of Earthlings in general.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,I haven't had positive experiences with Earthlings, either...so a soldier just alerts me even further.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Jura just carries that for fashion's sake.  Not that it's particularly useful next to a laser ring, anyway...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,We use violence when necessary.  Mejare's government are the real aggressors...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Mejare's military</i> is full of the violent types you're looking for.  We fight to survive.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,Swords are too heavy.  They'd just weigh me down in combat...like I keep telling Jura to remember.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,A pilot has little use for a sword.  Even our ground raids usually end far too quickly to get in close.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...You're certainly trusting.  I suppose you can tell how Jura's not actually very skilled with that thing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,...You seem to be referencing things, but I have no idea what they are.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'll be honest.  Half the time I have no clue what you're referring to when you speak.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm really out of my element here.  I suppose an Earth woman would better understand what you're always referencing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=bored,...<i>What</i> are you always talking about?  You seem to be speaking <i>around</i> us more than <i>to</i> us.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,Just from looking at you, you don't have a body to be ashamed of.  It's no issue...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=impressed,What's wrong?  Your figure is fine.  I assume being a "hero" keeps you in shape...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=bored,Why would you be ashamed of your body?  Maybe Earth women are more modest...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,But then...oh, right.  You were tricked into coming here, yes?  I was dragged...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look fine, Ochako.  Don't let others put you down about a figure you've worked for.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,...If it makes you feel better, Blake, you still look nice.  I'm sorry about your ears...whatever the reason is that you hid them.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=calm,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=impressed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,Birth...control?  What's that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Men are nothing to be afraid of, Florina.  Most are simpletons, anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Listen.  I've helped stage raids on Tarak's military.  Men are easily dealt with.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,You don't have to be afraid of men, Florina.  They probably relish that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,You've got to assert yourself around men.  They'll try to lord themselves over you otherwise.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I really wasn't interested.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I know what panties look like.  Put your skirt down.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I think you're the only one demanding your panties be shown.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,...Good to know you're not as modest as you look.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Can't you just take off your damn clothes?  Honestly.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Why even play if you're not going to follow the rules?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,For God's sake...this is preposterous.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I got dragged here.  You don't see <i>me</i> making a fuss about stripping.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,And you seemed so unassuming...just an embarrassed girl.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=awkward,Seems that outfit should have tipped me off about you...but it's rather normal on Mejare.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,How could such a flustered girl be hiding away incredible powers like that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed,To levitate under your own power...I need a ship to do it.  And you seemed so innocent...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.

3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,...At least you're passionate about it.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,What's "1983"?  I have no context for Earth years, Chiaki.
3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,...Would you like it if I started rattling off my Dread's specifications?

3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Drinking is disgusting...I would know.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,You have a nice figure, Misato.  Don't ruin it with booze.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Despite the alcohol, I guess you still have the professionalism to work for this "NERV," whatever it is.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Drinking...it's the sort of thing I'd <i>expect</i> from a military woman.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=annoyed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,I--I really didn't...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...You don't have to do that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...I really wasn't that curious.  Please don't start...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...Oh, dear.  I just lit a fire, didn't I?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Er...alright then.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,...Whatever you just did, can't you actually <i>strip</i>?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I wouldn't call that <i>stripping</i>...or part of the physical realm, for that matter.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I can't believe what I'm looking at.

4-male_removing_accessory=addressing,I see you're a sore winner.  Fair enough.
4-male_removing_accessory=impressed,I'm surprised you thought to bring that.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=confused,You're a strange specimen.  Male, wings, living in the sky?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,You live in the sky, was it?  There's a lot more to the universe than that.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's an "angel," exactly?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Whatever that item is, it's rather decorative for Tarakkian men...the common citizens, anyway.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is that military attire?  Tarakkian soldiers' garb can get rather decorative...but <i>only</i> the soldiers.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your outfit is decorative for a man.  Tarakkians tend to wear rags.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,I <i>would</i> like to look you in the eyes.  Men are mysterious enough without being mechanical.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You <i>do</i> have functioning eyes, yes?  Or did your creators not bother with those?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Must be thin fabric, then.  Why even wear it?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've just lost, so not sure I accept that.  But why are you wearing the blindfold, then?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...So what's your reasoning for wearing it?  Some kind of Earth fashion statement?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Care to explain that?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,See <i>better</i>?  I'd like an explanation for that...and why you wear it in the first place.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  You could try to act that way, then.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,Then I suggest you stop leering at me like a killer.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I consider men in general to be a threat, so maybe it's just my nerves.  I invite you to convince me of that.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Then stop carrying yourself like one.  This game is uncomfortable enough already.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,You seem uneasy about this.  Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around women?

4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.

4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,As far as I can tell, anyway.  You're male, right, Corrin?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,We don't have the best track record with spotting disguised men, so honesty about your sex would be helpful.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,As you can see, we're not very experienced in telling men and women apart.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Give him some space...it's probably embarrassing.
4-male_removed_accessory=bored,It's a long way back to the ship for me, you know.
4-male_removed_accessory=pleased,What fierce competitiveness.
4-male_removed_accessory=thinking,I really ought to rethink my strategy...I'm losing to a <i>man</i>.
4-male_removed_accessory=addressing,Feeling cocky, ~name~?  Soon, you won't.

4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=impressed,...Your clothing has a visual feed?  Earth really <i>is</i> more advanced...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm going to stop asking questions.  Apparently Earth technology is beyond my grasp...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm not sure if that counts as cheating.  Why not just use your eyes?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I have a visual feed, too.  It's called my eyes.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=awkward,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=bored,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Glad you took it in stride.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...I would've preferred it if you focused on flirting with women, if anyone.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Sex is no obstacle for your affections, is it?  Good to know...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Should I tell Barnette you're flirting with <i>men</i> now, too?  Actually, she probably already knows...

4-female_removing_accessory=confused,Is that in vogue on Earth?
4-female_removing_accessory=bored,You're being very frustrating.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=bored,...That attitude is why you never improve your piloting skills.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=disappointed,You'd be a much better Dread pilot if you gave your own skills the credit they deserve.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=disappointed,Give yourself some credit.  You're playing very well...and obviously you're reading my moves.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=unimpressed,Can't you just admit a game takes skill for once?  You're always downplaying yourself to save face when you lose.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  I was watching that from the beginning.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,You seemed the type to leave that on just to lure people into a false sense of security.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=pleased,Smart to leave that on until now.  Some of us probably got complacent...I've tried not to.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Don't--don't tell her our life stories, Jura.  Kahlua has nothing to do with this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,If you knew I liked spending time with Kahlua, why didn't you just leave me with <i>her</i> again?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Any charm I had has been crushed by being dragged here...and leave Kahlua out of this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  As in, like Jura.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Management?  Who's watching us play this?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm so confused.  Are you some kind of repeat offender?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see.  People say I don't laugh enough, so maybe you'll be of assistance there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm not known among the crew for my sense of humor, but I invite you to try.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=bored,Hm.  Never had a stable job myself...well, not one they pay me for.  But if you could make me laugh, I welcome it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking,I certainly don't want to be here, so if that's true...I could use a laugh.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I really thought you'd wait a while for something like those.  But I suppose feet have never been much of a concern for you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,Don't ask me why you'd concern yourself with fashion on your <i>feet</i> of all things.  Shoes are just there to protect...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=impressed,You're attached to those things.  Surprised you'd jump straight to that...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  That's actually quite substantial...but I see some other things that aren't.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,The typical response of a woman with something to hide.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your sudden panic is very convincing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...The least you could do is make an effort to convince me of that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  That's obvious from the worry on your face.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,It never ends with you and your trinkets.  Enjoying how much more clothed you are than me?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Can't help but twist the knife with my situation, can you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,You must really relish this opportunity to taunt me as I stand here topless.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,I imagine the only thing more satisfying to you than teasing everyone is how I'm half-naked as you do it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless...<i>you</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,God bless you--er...Launch?

4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Rude?  You're awfully defensive after some honest comments.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,At least you love your home planet.  Quiz me on Mejare.  I won't pull any punches.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,...So is a "country" some kind of special planet I should know about?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I'm a pirate.  So I have to deal with military types on a regular basis.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare's military isn't known for its commitment to human rights.  So I work with pirates.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I guess that was presumptuous of me.  I don't know what Earth's military is like, but Mejare's is corrupt.  I'm a pirate...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I pilot for a pirate crew to stage raids on Mejare's military.  So I'm not fond of them, considering the crewmates of mine they've killed.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't have money.  I was just making conversation.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I'm happy to discuss the finer points of piloting, but you're mistaken if you think I was making an offer...or have money at all.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I wasn't looking for a business transaction.  My crew doesn't use money regardless.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I see money is primarily how you operate, then.  My crew has none...and you can forget I said anything.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Is it the only thing that symbolizes your title?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I'm not following the politics here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=calm,A "crown"?  You've no need for titles or jewelry, Daisy.  You should be an athlete...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>Words</i>, huh?  Sounds nice, but I'd like to see you try to reason with Mejarian imperials.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't be so high and mighty.  If you're capable of fighting evil, you're capable of perpetrating it, too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Can't you give me a straight answer?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're starting the exhibitionism a little early, don't you think?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you exposing yourself on purpose?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Perhaps presenting like that will prepare us for the nudity to come.  Considerate of you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Kyu, you're...showing.  Actually, you probably know that, don't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=bored,I don't <i>like</i> my armor so much as I <i>need</i> it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,Tomatoes?  That would fly over a Tarakkian's head.  They only eat synthetic pellets.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,If not for my responsibilities, actually, I'd probably wear a sundress.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?

4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'd like to know more about these "video games."  They sound interesting, if impractical.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about these "video games" sounds familiar...like a lot of the women here would know them, at least.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=pleased,Parfet's good with computers.  Maybe she'd like "video games" like you do...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=bored,"Video games" honestly sound like our flight simulations.  Never liked those...not real enough.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,So, do you play these "video games" of yours in school?  Sounds better than Mejarian propaganda classes.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,O-oh no, I don't want to be a bother...my build doesn't even compare.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,N-no, you don't have to, Chun-Li.  I was just being complimentary...you look much better than I do.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-tips?  I don't want to impose.  And I certainly don't stack up to you...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-that's not necessary...I just need to work harder, I'm sure.  There's no need to compliment me, with the way you look...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Well, that explains your confidence.  You should know only the cards can save you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Layer all you want.  It won't save you from repeated mistakes.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased,Piling on the accessories seems more like a <i>not-losing</i> strategy than a winning one.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,You should know wearing decorations to get out of answering for your mistakes doesn't impress me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I should've known you'd threaten me just for saying that.  You're a walking stereotype.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Thanks.  But it's common on Mejare.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Blue hair is run-of-the-mill on Mejare.  There's prettier faces underneath than mine.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Matches my eyes?  If you say so.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=thinking,...Thank you.  Yours is nice, too.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,Finally putting down those ridiculous kinetic weapons.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,I couldn't care less about those things...now that they're gone.  I feel obligated to give you a laser ring.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>Wha--what are you...</i>

4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that didn't last long.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that's <i>one</i> down.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Looks like men have a use after all...thinning the herd.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see.  And what is this "Flame Tribe"?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,Just making conversation...I'm not interested in fashion.  But what's this Flame Tribe, exactly?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I'm assuming you belong to this "Flame Tribe"?  That sounds interesting.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=bored,Neither do I...but that's no reason to be ashamed.  I'm not going to let anyone relish it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,Do you think <i>I</i> do?  You look perfectly fit...don't give them the satisfaction of seeing that this bothers you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=addressing,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,What's wrong?  It's just a belt.  Are you alright?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=awkward,If you're so shy, maybe you shouldn't be playing this...I don't want to see a woman all broken up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,...Don't ask me how you're going to get all the way down to nude.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,I'll just hope you manage to win.  Stripping looks physicially painful for you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "crown"?  You seem fancy enough already...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I still don't know what you're supposed to be ruling over.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just your claim to...space?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Does that jewelry mark you as ruler of your observatory?  Wherever it is in space?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,The point of my suit is functionality.  It doesn't encumber me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Are you saying you wear that for fun?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,My suit is standard-issue.  I don't get to complain about comfort.

4-female_removing_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,...Why are you doing this to me?  I was just being polite...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=awkward,...Listen, I'm not the most talkative woman myself, but you look absolutely miserable.  Don't suffer quietly...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're blushing, Saki.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Your defensiveness still leaves me in doubt.  You can tell me if something's wrong.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...My pilots lie to me all the time, Saki.  And they're better liars than you are.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Saki, look.  I can tell when someone is distressed.  It's part of my job.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,There's no reason for that.  Bodysuits are slim and practical...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,What's wrong with the way you are now?  You look good, and it stays out of your way.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose heroes don't have much more choice in their outfits than pirates do...but bodysuits are good to have.  I'd never complain about mine.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's too bad...still, I would recommend keeping the suit.  They've always served me well...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=confused,Sector...?  Not sure how your federation organizes space, but I come from Mejare.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare.  It's...less than stellar.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=bored,I come from Mejare, the planet of women...not a healthy place.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare, Earth's uterus colony.  What sector it's in is beyond me...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,..At least you didn't cling to it.  Then I'd <i>really</i> be worried.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  I thought it was Jura at first, but no, it's you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't practice enough with your rapier, Jura.  It just weighs you down.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...You really don't seem the type, but that's...fascinating.  How exactly do you achieve that?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,Uh...that doesn't sound like it would help people.  Maybe you could elaborate?

4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=bored,I understand spiders' importance.  I still don't like them.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders,marker:riches_to_rags=disappointed,I've lived in apartments infested with spiders.  You'll have to forgive my distaste for them.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,I don't even <i>want</i> to beat you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I don't like politics...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  A woman who relies on a title should rethink her identity.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=annoyed,Jewelry marking your inflated importance...politics disgust me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "tiara"?  ...Must be that jewelry.  Why do you wear it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your tiara...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  Wherever it is you live.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=confused,Is that tiara what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just for decoration?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=bored,Does that have any value?  ...No, I'm not going to steal it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Whether or not you are, you seem awfully touchy about it...not what I would expect from a deity.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do people question your divinity often?  You seem defensive for someone so above us mere mortals.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,Surely a goddess would feel secure enough not to worry about a mortal's accusations.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,You may have the power of a goddess, but it seems your ego is all too human.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,I've seen enough of the supernatural to believe you, but I figured a goddess would be more...secure.
4-female_removed_accessory=unimpressed,I'm feeling the sisterly love.

4-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Another reminder of my own failures...

4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Jura just carries that for fashion's sake.  Not that it's particularly useful next to a laser ring, anyway...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,We use violence when necessary.  Mejare's government are the real aggressors...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Mejare's military</i> is full of the violent types you're looking for.  We fight to survive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,Swords are too heavy.  They'd just weigh me down in combat...like I keep telling Jura to remember.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,A pilot has little use for a sword.  Even our ground raids usually end far too quickly to get in close.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...You're certainly trusting.  I suppose you can tell how Jura's not actually very skilled with that thing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I really wasn't interested.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I think you're the only one demanding your panties be shown.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,...Good to know you're not as modest as you look.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm willing to believe it.  But actions speak louder than words...especially for an Earthling.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'll just be quiet and let your behavior speak for itself, Misato.  But Earthlings put me on edge already.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll keep that in mind, Misato.  I'm already wary of Earthlings in general.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,I haven't had positive experiences with Earthlings, either...so a soldier just alerts me even further.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Sorry if this is forward, but...you're very fit.  It's impressive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Can't believe you came to this game already showing off your muscles.  They're something else, too...

4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Certainly doesn't <i>look</i> like you wear much.  Your abs are showing...and they're hard to ignore.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,You just seem the type that people would take advantage of...until you have nowhere to go but places like this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,...I spent my teenage years in bars and alleyways, too.  I don't want anyone else going through that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,You just don't look like you want to be here.  I hate to see a woman alone in a seedy place...

4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'll be honest.  Half the time I have no clue what you're referring to when you speak.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm really out of my element here.  I suppose an Earth woman would better understand what you're always referencing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=bored,...<i>What</i> are you always talking about?  You seem to be speaking <i>around</i> us more than <i>to</i> us.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,Just from looking at you, you don't have a body to be ashamed of.  It's no issue...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=impressed,What's wrong?  Your figure is fine.  I assume being a "hero" keeps you in shape...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=bored,Why would you be ashamed of your body?  Maybe Earth women are more modest...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,But then...oh, right.  You were tricked into coming here, yes?  I was dragged...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look fine, Ochako.  Don't let others put you down about a figure you've worked for.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Despite the alcohol, I guess you still have the professionalism to work for this "NERV," whatever it is.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Drinking...it's the sort of thing I'd <i>expect</i> from a military woman.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=annoyed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Er...alright then.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,...Whatever you just did, can't you actually <i>strip</i>?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I wouldn't call that <i>stripping</i>...or part of the physical realm, for that matter.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I can't believe what I'm looking at.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=interested,It's alright.  I appreciate a challenge, and I'm glad you're giving me one.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=interested,I'm not mad in the slightest.  I've always wanted good competition out of you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=interested,My second-in-command should keep me sharp.  Keep it up, Jura.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=interested,A good challenge was all I could have hoped for in this game.  I'm satisfied with this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,Birth...control?  What's that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Perfect.  <i>Two</i> drunks running around.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Well, now it's a race to see who blacks out first.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=disappointed,Jura can drink for a while.  I suppose we'll see if Earth booze is powerful enough to topple you two.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Soldiers really <i>are</i> irresponsible.  What are the odds they're <i>both</i> drunks?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Unbelievable.  Two soldiers, both irresponsible alcoholics.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Soldiers, exotic hair, alcoholics.  It's like watching a stranger look in a mirror.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's got the height to down those drinks.  Don't ask me how <i>Sei's</i> doing it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's just drinking beer.  Sei's hard liquor is something else entirely.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,And you seemed so unassuming...just an embarrassed girl.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=awkward,Seems that outfit should have tipped me off about you...but it's rather normal on Mejare.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,How could such a flustered girl be hiding away incredible powers like that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed,To levitate under your own power...I need a ship to do it.  And you seemed so innocent...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Very funny.  Don't be surprised when you have to say that sincerely.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Don't make fun.  I plan on getting you to match me for real.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,If you haven't noticed, Jura, I'm not finished yet.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,Tease while you can, Jura.  Your cockiness is usually how you end up losing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,Who--you--I--you don't even seem all that concerned.  What's going on with you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...Is this another strange Earth experiment?  Launch!  Explain yourself!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Am I just supposed to accept that this happens to Earth women?  What's going on, Launch?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...You seem like this has happened before.  That's good--now explain it to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I see.  I'll keep that divinity in mind.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=bored,I really wasn't interested in it, but alright, then.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Divine or not, it's a bit of a cheat.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=awkward,How does one bond with a sword, exactly?  ...Stupid question, considering what the Paksis has done to our Dreads...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Done what?  Should I not have said that?  I don't--<i>oh</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,What do you mean, Mahiru?  Is she--o-oh no, you don't have to.  It's fine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Does Chiaki really like video games that much?  Does--oh.  Oh dear.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,<i>Now I've done it</i>?  What do you me--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  Uh...please don't.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,If these people can't spot it for themselves, there's no hope for them.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,I hope our hosts are sharp enough to see it for themselves.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,I think I know.  But maybe I should just let you have your fun.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Clear as day, as far as I can tell.  Unless you feel like being even more of a cheat tonight.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't even think about sharing drinks with her, Jura.  You do enough of that back on the ship.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't you dare touch her beer, Jura.  I know how you get...and Barnette's not around.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,You can strip all you want, Jura, but you're staying sober tonight, you hear me?  Don't join in with this woman.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,We've got a long flight home, Jura...so don't touch Misato's beer.  You don't handle it as well as you think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Men are nothing to be afraid of, Florina.  Most are simpletons, anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Listen.  I've helped stage raids on Tarak's military.  Men are easily dealt with.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,You don't have to be afraid of men, Florina.  They probably relish that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,You've got to assert yourself around men.  They'll try to lord themselves over you otherwise.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Why are you so angry, Kyu?  Why would they take off anything bigger?
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Surely you don't expect us to take anything bigger off before we have to, Kyu.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=bored,Not everyone's thrilled to be publicly naked, Kyu.
4-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Stop yelling, Kyu.  Not everyone is here because they wanted to be.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Are you drinking?  ...Don't even think about joining her, Jura.  I'm not carrying you out of here.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3-4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,I--I really didn't...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...You don't have to do that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...I really wasn't that curious.  Please don't start...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...Oh, dear.  I just lit a fire, didn't I?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Can't you just take off your damn clothes?  Honestly.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Why even play if you're not going to follow the rules?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,For God's sake...this is preposterous.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I got dragged here.  You don't see <i>me</i> making a fuss about stripping.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...I'm done with you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Reminds me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  Of course, I'd rather forget that evening.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,...If it makes you feel better, Blake, you still look nice.  I'm sorry about your ears...whatever the reason is that you hid them.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=calm,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=impressed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I'm just saying your defeatist mindset holds you back.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,You just say those things so you don't have to try.  You're smart, Jura...don't hold yourself back.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored,All I hear when you say that is a fear of failure.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,You're only doing yourself a disservice when you put down your intelligence...

-3-male_removing_accessory=pleased,Happy to twist the knife even further, are you?
-3-male_removing_accessory=addressing,Now you're just twisting the knife.
-3-male_removing_accessory=addressing,Merciless to the end, it seems...
-3-male_removing_accessory=interested,You're still wearing your ~clothing~...and I have nothing at all.
-3-male_removing_accessory=pleased,Rotten luck...is what a lesser woman would call this game.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,As far as I can tell, anyway.  You're male, right, Corrin?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,We don't have the best track record with spotting disguised men, so honesty about your sex would be helpful.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,As you can see, we're not very experienced in telling men and women apart.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Give him some space...it's probably embarrassing.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,Must be thin fabric, then.  Why even wear it?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,You've just lost, so not sure I accept that.  But why are you wearing the blindfold, then?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...So what's your reasoning for wearing it?  Some kind of Earth fashion statement?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Care to explain that?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=disappointed,See <i>better</i>?  I'd like an explanation for that...and why you wear it in the first place.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,I <i>would</i> like to look you in the eyes.  Men are mysterious enough without being mechanical.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You <i>do</i> have functioning eyes, yes?  Or did your creators not bother with those?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  You could try to act that way, then.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,Then I suggest you stop leering at me like a killer.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,I consider men in general to be a threat, so maybe it's just my nerves.  I invite you to convince me of that.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Then stop carrying yourself like one.  This game is uncomfortable enough already.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=confused,You're a strange specimen.  Male, wings, living in the sky?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,You live in the sky, was it?  There's a lot more to the universe than that.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=disappointed,So, what's an "angel," exactly?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Whatever that item is, it's rather decorative for Tarakkian men...the common citizens, anyway.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is that military attire?  Tarakkian soldiers' garb can get rather decorative...but <i>only</i> the soldiers.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your outfit is decorative for a man.  Tarakkians tend to wear rags.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,You seem uneasy about this.  Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around women?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=addressing,For a man to be so uncomfortable around women...you really <i>are</i> a model Tarakkian.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1-3,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=bored,Get over yourself.  I didn't know any men until I was nineteen, and you don't see <i>me</i> all bent out of shape.
-3-male_removed_accessory=interested,I can't help but respect such unrelenting competitiveness...
-3-male_removed_accessory=addressing,No pity for me?  I suppose it's better that way.
-3-male_removed_accessory=interested,Don't think you can toy with me and just walk away unscathed.
-3-male_removed_accessory=addressing,Any more thrilling moves?
-3-male_removed_accessory=interested,That's it.  Don't give me an inch.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=awkward,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=bored,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=disappointed,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=impressed,...Your clothing has a visual feed?  Earth really <i>is</i> more advanced...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,...I'm going to stop asking questions.  Apparently Earth technology is beyond my grasp...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm not sure if that counts as cheating.  Why not just use your eyes?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I have a visual feed, too.  It's called my eyes.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look like you've got a lot on your mind...and that it's not going to stay there.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,Small, talkative, male.  You and Hibiki might as well be...what's the word?  <i>Brothers</i>?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=disappointed,This is going to be a long game if you're going to talk this much.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Glad you took it in stride.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...I would've preferred it if you focused on flirting with women, if anyone.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Sex is no obstacle for your affections, is it?  Good to know...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Should I tell Barnette you're flirting with <i>men</i> now, too?  Actually, she probably already knows...
-3-female_removing_accessory=addressing,Pitiless to the end, it seems...
-3-female_removing_accessory=pleased,Sticking to the strategy, I see.
-3-female_removing_accessory=impressed,I've barely noticed you all game...good job.
-3-female_removing_accessory=impressed,Hmm...well, it makes sense.
-3-female_removing_accessory=unimpressed,Games shouldn't reward vanity...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,Finally putting down those ridiculous kinetic weapons.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=bored,I couldn't care less about those things...now that they're gone.  I feel obligated to give you a laser ring.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Whether or not you are, you seem awfully touchy about it...not what I would expect from a deity.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=disappointed,Do people question your divinity often?  You seem defensive for someone so above us mere mortals.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,Surely a goddess would feel secure enough not to worry about a mortal's accusations.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=addressing,You may have the power of a goddess, but it seems your ego is all too human.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=pleased,I've seen enough of the supernatural to believe you, but I figured a goddess would be more...secure.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2-3,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...Management?  Who's watching us play this?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,I wasn't told about any stripping-order rules.  Just common sense to not expose yourself unless necessary.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=bored,You're on a different planet than the rest of us, so to speak...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=confused,...I'm so confused.  Are you some kind of repeat offender?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  As in, like Jura.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I'm a pirate.  So I have to deal with military types on a regular basis.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=disappointed,Mejare's military isn't known for its commitment to human rights.  So I work with pirates.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I guess that was presumptuous of me.  I don't know what Earth's military is like, but Mejare's is corrupt.  I'm a pirate...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=bored,...I pilot for a pirate crew to stage raids on Mejare's military.  So I'm not fond of them, considering the crewmates of mine they've killed.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "crown"?  You seem fancy enough already...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I still don't know what you're supposed to be ruling over.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just your claim to...space?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=disappointed,...Does that jewelry mark you as ruler of your observatory?  Wherever it is in space?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,I see.  And what is this "Flame Tribe"?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=disappointed,Just making conversation...I'm not interested in fashion.  But what's this Flame Tribe, exactly?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,I'm assuming you belong to this "Flame Tribe"?  That sounds interesting.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Oh, it's that...jewelry.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I don't like politics...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=disappointed,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?  A woman who relies on a title should rethink her identity.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=annoyed,Jewelry marking your inflated importance...politics disgust me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,The point of my suit is functionality.  It doesn't encumber me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,Are you saying you wear that for fun?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_comfort=disappointed,My suit is standard-issue.  I don't get to complain about comfort.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=awkward,...Listen, I'm not the most talkative woman myself, but you look absolutely miserable.  Don't suffer quietly...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...You're blushing, Saki.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Your defensiveness still leaves me in doubt.  You can tell me if something's wrong.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...My pilots lie to me all the time, Saki.  And they're better liars than you are.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Saki, look.  I can tell when someone is distressed.  It's part of my job.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,What's wrong?  It's just a belt.  Are you alright?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=awkward,If you're so shy, maybe you shouldn't be playing this...I don't want to see a woman all broken up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,...Don't ask me how you're going to get all the way down to nude.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=bored,I'll just hope you manage to win.  Stripping looks physicially painful for you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=impressed,...Florina?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,...Is she disqualified, then?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that didn't last long.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=unimpressed,Well, that's <i>one</i> down.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,Looks like men have a use after all...thinning the herd.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You smell like alcohol.  I thought it was Jura at first, but no, it's you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Do you drink a lot?  You smell like it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You smell like alcohol...you really shouldn't drink.  It's bad for you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,I--you--<i>don't bring up Kahlua</i>.  We barely know these people.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Don't--don't tell her our life stories, Jura.  Kahlua has nothing to do with this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,If you knew I liked spending time with Kahlua, why didn't you just leave me with <i>her</i> again?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Any charm I had has been crushed by being dragged here...and leave Kahlua out of this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=confused,What exactly is <i>Jerusalem</i>?  A man's name?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders=bored,I understand spiders' importance.  I still don't like them.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_spiders,marker:riches_to_rags=disappointed,I've lived in apartments infested with spiders.  You'll have to forgive my distaste for them.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=bored,I don't <i>like</i> my armor so much as I <i>need</i> it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,Tomatoes?  That would fly over a Tarakkian's head.  They only eat synthetic pellets.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,saidMarker:gwen_style=pleased,If not for my responsibilities, actually, I'd probably wear a sundress.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,...Thanks.  But it's common on Mejare.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Blue hair is run-of-the-mill on Mejare.  There's prettier faces underneath than mine.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=disappointed,Matches my eyes?  If you say so.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:blue_hair=thinking,...Thank you.  Yours is nice, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=addressing,It covers everything, but it hides nothing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=calm,Don't be ashamed.  It's a perfectly sensible choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Bodysuits are comfortable and efficient, but they leave nothing to the imagination.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:bodysuit=disappointed,Your whole figure is on display, Marinette.  Of course, on Mejare, no one minds.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You don't practice enough with your rapier, Jura.  It just weighs you down.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,<i>Words</i>, huh?  Sounds nice, but I'd like to see you try to reason with Mejarian imperials.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,Don't be so high and mighty.  If you're capable of fighting evil, you're capable of perpetrating it, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Can't you give me a straight answer?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet=disappointed,Rude?  You're awfully defensive after some honest comments.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,At least you love your home planet.  Quiz me on Mejare.  I won't pull any punches.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,saidMarker:country_as_planet,marker:country_as_planet=disappointed,...So is a "country" some kind of special planet I should know about?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,I'd like to know more about these "video games."  They sound interesting, if impractical.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=disappointed,Something about these "video games" sounds familiar...like a lot of the women here would know them, at least.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=pleased,Parfet's good with computers.  Maybe she'd like "video games" like you do...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=bored,"Video games" honestly sound like our flight simulations.  Never liked those...not real enough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0,marker:state_schools=disappointed,So, do you play these "video games" of yours in school?  Sounds better than Mejarian propaganda classes.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,O-oh no, I don't want to be a bother...my build doesn't even compare.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,N-no, you don't have to, Chun-Li.  I was just being complimentary...you look much better than I do.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-tips?  I don't want to impose.  And I certainly don't stack up to you...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,T-that's not necessary...I just need to work harder, I'm sure.  There's no need to compliment me, with the way you look...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,What's a "crown"?  Is it the only thing that symbolizes your title?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Your crown...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  I'm not following the politics here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=confused,Is that crown what marks you as a "princess"?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=calm,A "crown"?  You've no need for titles or jewelry, Daisy.  You should be an athlete...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Trying to throw us off?  I was watching that from the beginning.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,You seemed the type to leave that on just to lure people into a false sense of security.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=pleased,Smart to leave that on until now.  Some of us probably got complacent...I've tried not to.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,Clever.  But don't think I hadn't noticed that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...I see.  I'm afraid my piracy is limited to the material.  How do you do this?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...Is that so?  We tend to steal...food, fuel, and weapons.  What are your methods?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,...You really don't seem the type, but that's...fascinating.  How exactly do you achieve that?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,Uh...that doesn't sound like it would help people.  Maybe you could elaborate?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see.  People say I don't laugh enough, so maybe you'll be of assistance there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=awkward,...I'm not known among the crew for my sense of humor, but I invite you to try.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=bored,Hm.  Never had a stable job myself...well, not one they pay me for.  But if you could make me laugh, I welcome it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking,I certainly don't want to be here, so if that's true...I could use a laugh.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=impressed,...You're starting the exhibitionism a little early, don't you think?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=confused,...Are you exposing yourself on purpose?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Perhaps presenting like that will prepare us for the nudity to come.  Considerate of you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=disappointed,Kyu, you're...showing.  Actually, you probably know that, don't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless...<i>you</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,God bless you--er...Launch?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--where's Launch?  Who are you?  What just happened?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Bless you--uh...<i>Launch</i>?  Your hair is...blue now.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,Why did you bring a sword in the first place?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=annoyed,That's not really <i>clothing</i>, Lyn.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=disappointed,This is just a game.  Why are you armed?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=calm,Jura has a sword like that...but she doesn't practice enough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=bored,I would've brought my laser ring if I knew this place allowed weapons...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=impressed,I thought you just weren't including that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=calm,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=confused,Sector...?  Not sure how your federation organizes space, but I come from Mejare.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare.  It's...less than stellar.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=bored,I come from Mejare, the planet of women...not a healthy place.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=thinking,Planet Mejare, Earth's uterus colony.  What sector it's in is beyond me...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,There's no reason for that.  Bodysuits are slim and practical...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,What's wrong with the way you are now?  You look good, and it stays out of your way.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose heroes don't have much more choice in their outfits than pirates do...but bodysuits are good to have.  I'd never complain about mine.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,That's too bad...still, I would recommend keeping the suit.  They've always served me well...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=thinking,Good...I was worried about that thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=disappointed,Why'd you bring that knife in the first place?  Is that how you died?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,I <i>hate</i> knives...or <i>anything</i> sharp.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=bored,..At least you didn't cling to it.  Then I'd <i>really</i> be worried.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I don't have money.  I was just making conversation.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I'm happy to discuss the finer points of piloting, but you're mistaken if you think I was making an offer...or have money at all.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I wasn't looking for a business transaction.  My crew doesn't use money regardless.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I see money is primarily how you operate, then.  My crew has none...and you can forget I said anything.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,The typical response of a woman with something to hide.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your sudden panic is very convincing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...The least you could do is make an effort to convince me of that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Right.  That's obvious from the worry on your face.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=unimpressed,What a shock.  The soldier immediately threatens violence when her loyalties are questioned.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're threatening me now?  You're already a model Mejarian imperial.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=thinking,I <i>used</i> to start fights in these sorts of places...I'd like to move on from that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I should've known you'd threaten me just for saying that.  You're a walking stereotype.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,I'm sure your body will be much more thrilling than mine.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=smug,I work hard in the gym to make my body presentable.  Yours is all genetics...and probably still better.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=smug,You're really excited about this dress drop of yours, aren't you?  I suppose you have plenty to be proud of.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased,At least you've found something you're truly passionate about--flaunting your own indecency.  But I suppose your body justifies that a little.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,I'm perfectly fine with being nude.  I keep losing, so it's all I deserve.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,I certainly don't relish it like you do, but I can live with it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,I'm not a lecherous exhibitionist like you.  I'm merely tolerating my nudity.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, Jura, I <i>love</i> being naked in public.  I'm bursting at the seams with lust.  Absolutely.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Anything's possible...especially if your opponent is convinced you can't win.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Don't get complacent, Jura.  One inch is all an enemy needs.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,Haven't I always told you to stay vigilant?  Now's the time.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing,You'd be surprised how quickly a lead can vanish...especially when you think it can't.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,A good challenge is all I ever wanted from you, so I'm happy.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing,If you're really this good at cards, we should play all the time...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,And you're just toying with me, stripping your rapier...this is great.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=happy,I'm really, honestly surprised, Jura.  I've always wanted to have a rival for this sort of thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,What's a "tiara"?  ...Must be that jewelry.  Why do you wear it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=disappointed,Your tiara...is that some kind of symbol of authority?  Wherever it is you live.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=confused,Is that tiara what marks you as a "princess"?  Or just for decoration?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=bored,Does that have any value?  ...No, I'm not going to steal it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,I don't even <i>want</i> to beat you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=bored,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Oh, great.  Another vortex.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=addressing,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,You play as fiercely as Gascogne...
-3-female_removed_accessory=addressing,I can respect a woman with such fierce competitiveness.  I am one.
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,I can respect a woman with such fierce competitiveness...
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,Going for the quick and merciless kill...like a true pilot.
-3-female_removed_accessory=addressing,You've got a pirate's killer instinct, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,Just from looking at you, you don't have a body to be ashamed of.  It's no issue...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=impressed,What's wrong?  Your figure is fine.  I assume being a "hero" keeps you in shape...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=bored,Why would you be ashamed of your body?  Maybe Earth women are more modest...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,But then...oh, right.  You were tricked into coming here, yes?  I was dragged...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=disappointed,You look fine, Ochako.  Don't let others put you down about a figure you've worked for.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Can't you just take off your damn clothes?  Honestly.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Why even play if you're not going to follow the rules?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,For God's sake...this is preposterous.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=unimpressed,I got dragged here.  You don't see <i>me</i> making a fuss about stripping.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=annoyed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=calm,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=impressed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed,I...of course not.  Men are just a curiosity...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=awkward,I--have a scientific interest in men, but...that's too weird.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=awkward,A <i>man</i>?  I might be standing here naked, but...that isn't for me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,...Men are far too bestial and bizarre for that sort of thing.  Is that why you brought me here?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,...I could never...be with a man.  I'm private enough with other women...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,That gun is pretty interesting...shaped like a man's kinetic one, but fires energy like a woman's.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=impressed,Barnette would have liked to take a look at that gun...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=calm,I have my own experience combining men and women's weapons together...not with guns, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Er...alright then.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,...Whatever you just did, can't you actually <i>strip</i>?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I wouldn't call that <i>stripping</i>...or part of the physical realm, for that matter.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...I can't believe what I'm looking at.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased,There's just no changing you.  But I'm going to keep on trying.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing,One day I'll manage to make you care about your actual profession.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Is there no way I can make you fit piloting into your life alongside fashion, makeup, and Barnette?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased,You really are impossible to work with.  But when you're proving yourself superior like this, maybe <i>I</i> need to change.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=disappointed,I suppose medics are a little less reprehensible.  Maybe you could help train Paiway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=unimpressed,How thoughtful of you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=bored,Actually, if you're a medic, the Nirvana could use you.  Our only doctor is a man.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=addressing,That's sweet of you, but I've got no time for relationships.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=smug,I don't know, Jura.  Do I really deserve a girlfriend when I spend my free time stripping in bars?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=pleased,<i>That's</i> not happening.  Playing a game like this officially makes me used goods.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=addressing,Sorry, Jura, but I can't fit another woman into my life.  Wrangling you and the other pilots takes up all my time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,...You seem to be referencing things, but I have no idea what they are.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'll be honest.  Half the time I have no clue what you're referring to when you speak.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm really out of my element here.  I suppose an Earth woman would better understand what you're always referencing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=bored,...<i>What</i> are you always talking about?  You seem to be speaking <i>around</i> us more than <i>to</i> us.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,You just seem the type that people would take advantage of...until you have nowhere to go but places like this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=thinking,...I spent my teenage years in bars and alleyways, too.  I don't want anyone else going through that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,You just don't look like you want to be here.  I hate to see a woman alone in a seedy place...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=awkward,It's my job to worry about women...especially ones who look like they don't belong.  Don't you have a home?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Sorry if this is forward, but...you're very fit.  It's impressive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Can't believe you came to this game already showing off your muscles.  They're something else, too...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,What kind of exercise do you do?  Your abs are toned...I'd like to get that fit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=impressed,Certainly doesn't <i>look</i> like you wear much.  Your abs are showing...and they're hard to ignore.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3-4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...I'm just going to ignore you from now on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,That's it.  I'm ignoring you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not worth my attention.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=bored,...I'm done with you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Drinking is disgusting...I would know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,You have a nice figure, Misato.  Don't ruin it with booze.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=bored,Despite the alcohol, I guess you still have the professionalism to work for this "NERV," whatever it is.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=unimpressed,Drinking...it's the sort of thing I'd <i>expect</i> from a military woman.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'm willing to believe it.  But actions speak louder than words...especially for an Earthling.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I'll just be quiet and let your behavior speak for itself, Misato.  But Earthlings put me on edge already.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,...I'll keep that in mind, Misato.  I'm already wary of Earthlings in general.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=bored,I haven't had positive experiences with Earthlings, either...so a soldier just alerts me even further.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,Who--you--I--you don't even seem all that concerned.  What's going on with you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...Is this another strange Earth experiment?  Launch!  Explain yourself!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,Am I just supposed to accept that this happens to Earth women?  What's going on, Launch?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=angry,...You seem like this has happened before.  That's good--now explain it to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I see.  I'll keep that divinity in mind.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=bored,I really wasn't interested in it, but alright, then.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Divine or not, it's a bit of a cheat.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=awkward,How does one bond with a sword, exactly?  ...Stupid question, considering what the Paksis has done to our Dreads...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,In case anyone missed it, Jura decided to count her <i>armbands</i> as a strippable item.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,Don't think I didn't catch you stripping your armbands.  You must think this teasing bit is pretty funny.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing,I noticed you took off your armbands of all things.  Teasing like that just makes me want to beat you even more.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=smug,I'm not justifying my perspective to a woman for whom sex encompasses all of existence.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Why are you so angry, Kyu?  Why would they take off anything bigger?
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Surely you don't expect us to take anything bigger off before we have to, Kyu.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=bored,Not everyone's thrilled to be publicly naked, Kyu.
-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=disappointed,Stop yelling, Kyu.  Not everyone is here because they wanted to be.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,And you seemed so unassuming...just an embarrassed girl.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=awkward,Seems that outfit should have tipped me off about you...but it's rather normal on Mejare.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=surprised-horny,How could such a flustered girl be hiding away incredible powers like that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed,To levitate under your own power...I need a ship to do it.  And you seemed so innocent...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I really wasn't interested.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I know what panties look like.  Put your skirt down.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,I think you're the only one demanding your panties be shown.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,...Good to know you're not as modest as you look.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,Birth...control?  What's that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Reminds me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  Of course, I'd rather forget that evening.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't even think about sharing drinks with her, Jura.  You do enough of that back on the ship.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't you dare touch her beer, Jura.  I know how you get...and Barnette's not around.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,You can strip all you want, Jura, but you're staying sober tonight, you hear me?  Don't join in with this woman.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,We've got a long flight home, Jura...so don't touch Misato's beer.  You don't handle it as well as you think.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Jura just carries that for fashion's sake.  Not that it's particularly useful next to a laser ring, anyway...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,We use violence when necessary.  Mejare's government are the real aggressors...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Mejare's military</i> is full of the violent types you're looking for.  We fight to survive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,Swords are too heavy.  They'd just weigh me down in combat...like I keep telling Jura to remember.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,A pilot has little use for a sword.  Even our ground raids usually end far too quickly to get in close.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...You're certainly trusting.  I suppose you can tell how Jura's not actually very skilled with that thing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,I--I really didn't...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...You don't have to do that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...I really wasn't that curious.  Please don't start...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=awkward,...Oh, dear.  I just lit a fire, didn't I?
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,...This is the last time I try to make small talk about an Earth woman's interests.
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,And Jura wonders why I don't bother talking to people...
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,...At least you're passionate about it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,What's "1983"?  I have no context for Earth years, Chiaki.
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,...Would you like it if I started rattling off my Dread's specifications?
-3-female_removed_accessory,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,Ah, yes.  The <i>enn-ee-ess</i>.  That explains everything.  Thanks, Chiaki.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,Done what?  Should I not have said that?  I don't--<i>oh</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,What do you mean, Mahiru?  Is she--o-oh no, you don't have to.  It's fine.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,...Does Chiaki really like video games that much?  Does--oh.  Oh dear.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mahiru=awkward,<i>Now I've done it</i>?  What do you me--oh.  <i>Oh</i>.  Uh...please don't.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Are you drinking?  ...Don't even think about joining her, Jura.  I'm not carrying you out of here.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=annoyed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=disappointed,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=bored,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=thinking,I don't drink, Sei...not anymore.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Men are nothing to be afraid of, Florina.  Most are simpletons, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,Listen.  I've helped stage raids on Tarak's military.  Men are easily dealt with.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=bored,You don't have to be afraid of men, Florina.  They probably relish that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=disappointed,You've got to assert yourself around men.  They'll try to lord themselves over you otherwise.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=disappointed,You look a little incensed.  Surely you understood this was part of the game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,No need to get all angry.  You have plenty of clothes to lose still.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,You're turning all red.  You'll never win this if you lose your composure so early.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Perfect.  <i>Two</i> drunks running around.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Well, now it's a race to see who blacks out first.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=disappointed,Jura can drink for a while.  I suppose we'll see if Earth booze is powerful enough to topple you two.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,Soldiers really <i>are</i> irresponsible.  What are the odds they're <i>both</i> drunks?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Unbelievable.  Two soldiers, both irresponsible alcoholics.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=unimpressed,Soldiers, exotic hair, alcoholics.  It's like watching a stranger look in a mirror.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's got the height to down those drinks.  Don't ask me how <i>Sei's</i> doing it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=bored,At least Misato's just drinking beer.  Sei's hard liquor is something else entirely.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,...If it makes you feel better, Blake, you still look nice.  I'm sorry about your ears...whatever the reason is that you hid them.

-2-male_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Give me <i>something</i>...

-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=mast-3-pleased,I <i>would</i> like to look you in the eyes while I do this.  Men are mysterious enough without being mechanical.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=mast-3-pleased,You <i>do</i> have functioning eyes, yes?  Or did your creators not bother with those?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=mast-4-pleased,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman...masturbating to you here on the floor.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=mast-3-pleased,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=mast-4-pleased,I certainly prefer looking a man in the eye while I do this...even if he <i>is</i> artificial.
-2-male_removed_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,Give me something to work with here...
-2-male_removed_accessory=mast-3-pleased,You're so cruel...
-2-male_removed_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,This isn't easy for me, you know...
-2-male_removed_accessory=mast-4-pleased,Even <i>this</i> isn't enough for you?  Fine...
-2-male_removed_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,I've only met a few men.  I'm not asking for much here...
-2-male_removed_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-3-pleased,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-2-pleased,And "2B" is a gynoid, yes?  I'd very much like to see Earth's mechanical interpretation of women...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,Earth has harvested enough of our organs to design a female robot.  It's only fair I should get to meet this <i>2B</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-2-pleased,It's a shame "2B" couldn't have come here.  Apparently she has my temperament...and I'd like a conversation with a gynoid.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-3-pleased,If that's true, my crewmates' comparisons of me to a machine are surprisingly accurate.  I'd like to meet her.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-2-pleased,If I really would get along with this "2B," then my stoicism is paying dividends.  Bring her along next time.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=mast-2-pleased,I'd like to meet this "2B," but am I <i>that</i> robotic?  I'm masturbating, after all.
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-4-disappointed,This really <i>is</i> going to take me a while...
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-4-disappointed,I hate vanity...and now I'm hating you.
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,This is what I get for playing badly...
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,Mocking your enemy after they've lost is poor form.
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-4-disappointed,This game was supposed to loosen <i>me</i> up.  You could use some of that...
-2-female_removing_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-3-pleased,You really need to learn how to mind your own business.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-4-pleased,You don't have the right to know everything about me, Jura.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-2-pleased,I have you on a need-to-know basis.  We're still just colleagues, after all.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-3-pleased,I'll never understand why you insist on flooding your work environment with sex and gossip.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=mast-4-pleased,Neither do I...but that's no reason to be ashamed.  I'm not going to let anyone relish it, even now.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,Do you think <i>I</i> do?  You look perfectly fit...don't give them the satisfaction of seeing that this bothers you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=mast-2-pleased,I hope you're not implying that I <i>do</i>.  All the same, being embarrassed is just going to encourage them to twist the knife.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,People usually assume <i>I</i> do because of my suit...and you dress rather similarly.  Don't give them the satisfaction.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,Finally putting them down.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=mast-3-pleased,I thought you just weren't including that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=mast-3-pleased,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=mast-3-pleased,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=mast-2-pleased,Figures you'd start with that.  I've got no right to complain...I would've lost had you walked in here naked.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=mast-3-pleased,It's not much, but strip whatever you want, Jura.  I would've lost all the same.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=mast-4-pleased,I should have known you'd strip things like that.  We're going to be here all night.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=mast-3-pleased,Of course you'd start with that.  I'd be concerned for your health if you didn't.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,If you're trying to get my attention, feet don't interest me.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,You'd best hope Earth people appreciate feet, because I don't.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-4-pleased,Now I'm curious if Earthlings like women's feet.  I'm indifferent...even like this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,Feet take a lot of abuse...even yours.  So I wouldn't call this titillating.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=mast-3-disappointed,I'm not even mad I lost to you.  Not if you're going to keep <i>this</i> up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=mast-3-disappointed,Even watching you <i>strip</i> is exhausting.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=mast-3-disappointed,The stripping is bad enough, but I can barely tell what you're saying.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,It would seem that's the last of your trinkets.  Better start playing seriously, Jura.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-4-pleased,If you weren't taking this seriously before, now's the time.  Don't give up!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,No more accessories, it seems...but that's better.  Now I want to see what your skill can manage.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-4-pleased,Only that dress can save you now...that, and your own wits.  I have my doubts about your underwear situation.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,Tch...just keep playing.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,I like women too, you know.  You could help me out here.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-3-pleased,No need to be shy, ~name~.  I've shot that to hell.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,What a killjoy.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-2-disappointed,I <i>can</i> use my imagination, but here I shouldn't have to.
-2-female_removed_accessory=mast-3-disappointed,...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=mast-2-pleased,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alcohol.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=mast-4-pleased,Are you drinking?  ...Don't join her, Jura.  I'm too busy to stop you when you've had enough.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself, you know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=mast-2-disappointed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,It's true...I barely own anything.  Gascogne <i>did</i> give me a swimsuit...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,I'll admit my wardrobe is scarce.  I have a sundress...not that I'd want the crew to see me in it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,Is the smock I sleep in not fashionable enough for you, Jura?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=mast-3-pleased,The casual observer would probably guess my eyepiece is a fashion item.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-3-pleased,Don't you dare complain about the floor being cold.  I have far more right to do that, but here I am.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-4-pleased,Maybe now you'll appreciate how chilly the floor is in here.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-4-pleased,I've learned to love the coolness of this place.  This should be your first taste of the floor's temperature.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mast-3-pleased,I'd better not hear you whine about the floor's coldness.  Just look at me...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-4-pleased,I don't need to take this.  I've already lost...now I'm going to enjoy myself, regardless of your needling.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,Would you really have any respect for me if I were as lecherous as you?  ...Though I guess this proves I am.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,Maybe I'd open up about sex if you stripped more than your armbands.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,Watching you try to pry sex talk out of me seems a lot more entertaining than whatever your reaction would be to my answer.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=mast-3-pleased,Good to know that under no circumstances would you accept my help.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=mast-4-pleased,You'd win if you focused on my words and not my situation.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=mast-3-pleased,Perhaps my advice isn't worth much, considering where it got <i>me</i>...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=mast-3-pleased,I'm just trying to help you.  No need to be so dismissive...though I can understand dismissing the words of a masturbating woman.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=mast-3-disappointed,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=mast-2-disappointed,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=mast-3-disappointed,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=mast-3-pleased,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=mast-2-pleased,Jura got Dita drunk once.  She was essentially the same, just less energetic.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=mast-2-disappointed,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=mast-3-disappointed,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=mast-4-disappointed,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=mast-2-disappointed,Birth...control?  What's that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=mast-2-disappointed,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=mast-3-disappointed,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=mast-3-disappointed,...What's "birth control"?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Remember when you got <i>Dita</i> drunk, Jura?  I'd rather not.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alochol.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover afterwards...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself, you know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=mast-2-disappointed,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.

-1-male_removing_accessory=pleased-2,How boring.  Can't you satisfy a woman's curiosity?
-1-male_removing_accessory=interested-2,Even now, you refuse to give me an inch...
-1-male_removing_accessory=impressed-2,I <i>masturbated</i> for you, and you're still only down to your ~clothing~...
-1-male_removing_accessory=impressed-2,<i>Still</i>?  I lost this badly to a man?
-1-male_removing_accessory=bored-2,...Women are more fun.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing-2,I <i>would</i> like to look you in the eyes.  Men are mysterious enough without being mechanical.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing-2,You <i>do</i> have functioning eyes, yes?  Or did your creators not bother with those?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing-2,You're not afraid to look me in the eye, are you?  I'm just a normal woman...now that I'm finished masturbating.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=interested-2,Don't think I forgot about that thing...but you're free to look me in the eye and call me a liar.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=addressing-2,I <i>did</i> have to humiliate myself in front of you.  The least you could do is let me see your eyes.
-1-male_removed_accessory=interested-2,For me to be outplayed so thoroughly...
-1-male_removed_accessory=pleased-2,For me to be so soundly defeated...I didn't know men were smart enough for deception.
-1-male_removed_accessory=horny-2,To rout me, and then make me cum in front of you...<i>incredible.</i>
-1-male_removed_accessory=interested-2,You've been toying with me this whole time, haven't you?
-1-male_removed_accessory=pleased-2,Damn you, ~name~...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=pleased-2,The more you talk about this <i>2B</i> woman, the more curious I become.  Is she an android, too?  Or...gynoid.

-1-female_removing_accessory=addressing-2,To be so far ahead of me...have you considered a piloting career?
-1-female_removing_accessory=impressed-2,After all that time I took to finish, you're still so clothed...
-1-female_removing_accessory=happy-2,Your play has been excellent...it's giving me goosebumps.
-1-female_removing_accessory=pleased-2,I really thought tonight would be an easy win...I sold Earth women short.
-1-female_removing_accessory=pleased-2,This place attracts the best women around, it seems.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=addressing-2,I thought you just weren't including that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=pleased-2,Pilots need better presence of mind than that...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=interested-2,You need to be better aware of your options.  It's a dangerous universe out there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=interested-2,You have no idea how glad I am to see all those ridiculous accessories go.  But then, I also want you to win...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing-2,No, thanks.  Jewelry isn't for me...especially <i>your</i> kind.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=stretching-2,Jewelry has no place in my life...unless my eyepiece counts as jewelry.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=interested-2,I can't stay mad at you when you've got every right to make fun of me.  I should have beaten you, or at least kept even...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored-2,...I'd be fascinated if you even seemed in control of this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=disappointed-2,You're like a living Paksis...without the warmth.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=disappointed-2,I didn't think my opponents would be <i>this</i> hard to understand.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=stretching-2,You know, I'm actually in a good mood.  Try not to ruin it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing-2,If you're wondering why I'm always serious, it's because you constantly do this to me.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=pleased-2,If you haven't noticed, Jura, <i>you're</i> the one making me miserable half the time.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=addressing-2,How sportsmanlike of you.  I'll remember this,
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=unimpressed-2,As if I'd want to touch one of those clunky men's weapons.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=pleased-2,Get yourself a laser ring.  You'll thank me, and so will your eardrums.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=pleased-2,Finally putting them down.  Now, try acting like you're playing a friendly card game.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=disappointed-2,<i>Valore?</i>  <i>That's</i> your hypothesis?  ...I'm afraid not.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=bored-2,Oh, please...Valore's even more of a professional colleague than you are.  I could never...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=awkward-2,<i>Valore?</i>  I...I couldn't look at her that way.  We're in too similar of positions...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=interested-2,So this was your stripping plan.  I guess I expected something like it...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=addressing-2,Shame I couldn't hang around to analyze your stripping choices when they mattered to me.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased-2,If <i>that's</i> what you consider clothing, you've got this game locked down for sure.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased-2,Just your rapier...I should have expected this sort of teasing from you, but it wouldn't have mattered if I did.
-1-female_removed_accessory=pleased-2,I'll be humiliated <i>and</i> routed at this rate.
-1-female_removed_accessory=horny-2,You're a lot more skilled than you've been letting on.  I like women with secrets...
-1-female_removed_accessory=addressing-2,I could learn a lot from you, ~name~.  Maybe not sexually, but in poker...
-1-female_removed_accessory=happy-2,I wonder if even Gascogne could handle you...
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested-2,At least I'm learning about Earth fashion, sitting here defeated and humiliated.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=impressed-2,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alochol.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=pleased-2,Are you drinking?  You'd better not be thinking of joining her, Jura.  I haven't loosened up <i>that</i> much.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=pleased-2,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself, you know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=bored-2,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:0-0=pleased-2,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,This is reminding me of when you got Dita drunk, Jura.  That was cruel...she's a sweet girl.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=addressing-2,Are you sure you can handle all those drinks?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=addressing-2,I don't know <i>where</i> you're putting all that alcohol.  You're tiny.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing-2,Oh, please.  You took that rapier from a soldier <i>I</i> shot.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing-2,Funny how you were careful not to mention how <i>I</i> was the one to take down the soldier you stole that from.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=addressing-2,Shouldn't you be telling lies about how you got your rapier when I'm <i>not</i> around to correct them?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased-2,You're awfully proud of yourself for looting the corpses of soldiers <i>I</i> took care of.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored-2,...Just keep on playing.  I'm going to sit here quietly.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=bored-2,...I have nothing to say to that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking-2,Well, my Fama <i>did</i> always say love was wonderful...maybe she was right.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=disappointed-2,I don't appreciate being antagonized, you know.  I've already lost.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=interested-2,Normally I'd be irritated.  I guess masturbating really <i>did</i> cheer me up.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=pleased-2,If your plan was to get me to masturbate so I wouldn't get so annoyed, well...it worked.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=addressing-2,It's hard for me to care at this point, having lost so resoundingly.  Just try to win the game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=interested-2,Win this game and you can make fun of me all you want, Jura.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=bored-2,Oh, for God's sake...it never ends with you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=stretching-2,Maybe I am, but this is still quite comfortable.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=stretching-2,Just a lucky side effect.  The relaxation is very real.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=stretching-2,Always jumping to conclusions.  I'm just a little tired after that...nothing else to it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=bored-2,Just...<i>why</i>?  Are you afraid to show off your body?  It can't be <i>that</i> bad.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed-2,Doesn't that take more effort than just removing your clothes?  Are you hiding something about your body?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=unimpressed-2,Are you <i>that</i> afraid to be naked?  Is there something about your body you're trying to hide?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed-2,For all your bluster and lightshows, you actually <i>do</i> seem fairly skilled at cards.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=bored-2,You're pretty good at this game.  Why do you insist on acting so strangely?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed-2,Underneath all your costume-switching, you actually seem to know what you're doing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused-2,Birth...control?  What's that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused-2,Birth control?  You <i>control birth</i> on Earth?  That sounds horrible.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused-2,...What did you just say?  "Birth control"?  What does that mean?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-3,marker:bc_response=confused-2,...What's "birth control"?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=impressed-2,Are you drinking?  I didn't even know this place served alochol.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=pleased-2,Are you drinking?  Jura drinks too much.  Always hungover at the next morning's meeting.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=pleased-2,Are you drinking?  No thanks.  Can't lose control of myself, you know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=bored-2,Drinking...just like a soldier.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=pleased-2,Are you drinking?  The state-approved Mejarian libations are all full of estrogen.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,totalMales:0-0=addressing-2,Half-naked and liquored-up sounds like a bad combination.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confused-2,You have...cat ears?  Earth is a strange planet...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy-2,What's wrong with having cat ears?  It makes you unique.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=impressed-2,I was wondering why you waited so long to take that off.  I don't see what the issue is, but...sorry.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

0-male_removing_minor=calm,...
0-male_removing_minor=bored,Can't you be more interesting?
0-male_removing_minor=bored,This is boring...
0-male_removing_minor=disappointed,You've got a cooler head than Hibiki.  He'd be all worked up by now.
0-male_removing_minor=bored,Dita still thinks men are aliens.  That would be a lot more interesting, honestly...
0-male_removing_minor=bored,Should have done some research on how men dress.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why would I be?  Answer the question.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=bored,<i>I'm</i> surprised you think I'll just forget my question.  Explain yourself.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,Unless you're familiar with Paksis technology, I'd say this makes us even.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=addressing,By all means, come aboard the Nirvana.  I'd be impressed if you recognized everything we had.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=disappointed,I seriously doubt you'd be familiar with my Dread.  So explain <i>your</i> technology.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Sandals?  Far too casual for any Tarakkian man to be seen wearing.  They'd be whipped for not working.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Sandals seem casual for a soldier.  I suppose Earth isn't as strict as Tarak in that regard.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Bart's the only Tarakkian man I can picture wearing sandals...and that's because he's rich.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,You seem uneasy about this.  Didn't you <i>grow up</i> around women?
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=addressing,For a man to be so uncomfortable around women...you really <i>are</i> a model Tarakkian.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,totalFemales:3-4,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=bored,Get over yourself.  I didn't know any men until I was nineteen, and you don't see <i>me</i> all bent out of shape.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=disappointed,I never thought a man could be so uncomfortable with nudity.  A year ago I was convinced you didn't <i>wear</i> clothes.
0-male_removed_minor=pleased,For a while, Dita was convinced men just had refractive force-fields instead of clothes.
0-male_removed_minor=disappointed,Mejare would strip you down if they captured you...but they wouldn't make a game of it.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,Interesting.  A year ago I wasn't sure men <i>wore</i> clothes.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,Shall we continue?
0-male_removed_minor=disappointed,You're being very predictable.
0-male_removed_minor=calm,...
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=impressed,Sandals are normal on Earth?  You must lead peaceful lives...
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=disappointed,Don't get me wrong, Pit.  My opinion of Tarakkian culture isn't a glowing one.
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=bored,Say what you want about Tarakkians--they manage their resources much better than the women of Mejare.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=impressed,A <i>what</i>?  You're...a <i>machine</i>?  ...I guess I'll find out soon enough.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=bored,...You're an <i>android</i>?  We have robots, but a fully human machine?  ...We'll see.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=angry,What do you mean, an <i>android</i>?  You--you look just like a man!  Don't toy with me!
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not seriously a machine?  I'll believe it when I see it...you're too human-looking.
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  I know men aren't actually animals...
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why are you just grunting?
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,Maybe men really <i>are</i> just animals...
0-female_removing_minor=awkward,You should have worn more clothing...of course, I don't have much on myself.
0-female_removing_minor=disappointed,This game is a little strange.  Couldn't you win just by wearing tons of accessories?
0-female_removing_minor=impressed,A little more substantial.
0-female_removing_minor=thinking,I don't own many clothes like that...
0-female_removing_minor=thinking,I used to own something like that...but it doesn't fit me anymore.
0-female_removing_minor=calm,...
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds impressive, but I'd rather that money went towards someone's meal.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=awkward,Who--oh.  Your wrestling partner was still around...why do you need help?
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your partner?  Why's she helping you?  Can't you take them off alone?
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,How tight are those boots that you need your partner to help get them off?  Just seems impractical...
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,Do you really need help, or was that an excuse to call over your partner?  ...Not that it matters, I suppose.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=disappointed,...Having friends is good, too.  In case you have a moment of weakness.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=disappointed,So...you're friends with this woman?  Lovers?  What is it?
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=pleased,I would have just let her go...but then, I suppose I'd keep Dita here if she tried to run off.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,Good on you, Lyn.  Don't let your friends make mistakes.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,...Of course, women need each other.  I appreciate my crewmates, even if I try not to show it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,So, Earth is devastated where you come from because of the "Second Impact"?  The Earth I know might change your mind on that...
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,This "Second Impact" sounds like what the Harvest wants to do to Mejare.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,I heard something about the Earth you know going through a "Second Impact"...the one <i>I</i> know isn't in great shape, either.
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I see.  And how would you rank your own abilities among all these people?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,A whole population...must be the work of Earth's experimentation.  How would you say your powers stack up?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=bored,This girl lives in a world full of superpowers, and I live deprived of the opposite sex.  Would you call your powers strong?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,So there's a large variety of these powers.  Are yours particularly potent, then?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=disappointed,Why did you keep those on for so long?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,...Is something the matter, Kyoko?  You look horrified.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=thinking,I was wondering why you were waiting to take those off...
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Kyoko...are you feeling alright?  What's the matter?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,...Jura, if you <i>ever</i> pulled something like this, I'd mount your head on my tailfin.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Even Hibiki isn't <i>this</i> reckless.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=disappointed,I was wondering why you had that casually draped around yourself.  Like that, it would just get in the way...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=disappointed,You shouldn't wear your jacket like that.  It'll get caught on something during combat...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=awkward,To just drape your jacket around yourself like that...I'd find it irritating.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=bored,Not too unlike how Jura drapes her dress around herself, free-flowing and liable for accidents.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I was wondering why you had that casually draped around yourself.  Like that, it would just get in the way...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You shouldn't wear your jacket like that.  It'll get caught on something during combat...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,To just drape your jacket around yourself like that...I'd find it irritating.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Well, Jura, I harp on you for having loose clothing...but you're not <i>this</i> bad about it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Let me just say I'm glad you don't drape your dress around yourself this far down, Jura.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
0-female_removing_minor,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=unimpressed,Can't it?  You seem to be doing a good job.
0-female_removing_minor,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=annoyed,I'm telling you, <i>I don't know</i> what "Super Mario" is.  Slow down.
0-female_removing_minor,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,I've made it twenty years without knowing about it, so I think it's not all that important.
0-female_removing_minor,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario1,notSaidMarker:chi_mush2,priority:381,marker:chi_mush2=bored,...Why are you doing this to me?  I was just being polite...
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,This is ridiculuous.  Why am I being forced to watch a woman commit suicide?
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=confused,What?  No, Parfet is a crewmate of mine.  She's got glasses like yours...and is similarly engrossed with machines.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,What?  No, I know a <i>woman</i> named Parfet.  That wasn't an insult--she's our chief engineer.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=addressing,...I <i>do</i> like parfaits, but I meant a crewmate of mine <i>named</i> Parfet.  You seemed similarly into machinery.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=addressing,Hm?  Oh no, I meant our chief engineer Parfet.  She does good work...and she's heard that joke before, don't worry.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,...Seems it was wrong of me to pry.  Still, the technology is fascinating...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,I apologize...my crewmates who undertook it scarcely seem to remember, let alone mind.  I was curious how it worked...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,You don't have to share anything...I was just wondering how the whole process worked.  My crewmates don't remember...
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,...I shouldn't have brought it up.  I was only hoping to learn the technology...my Oma worked as a scientist.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,If one of my pilots pulled a stunt like this, I'd slap their necks broken.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Even Hibiki isn't <i>this</i> reckless.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
0-female_removed_minor=calm,...
0-female_removed_minor=thinking,You've got to focus.  Focus is key to almost anything.
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,You'll be out soon at this rate.
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,Don't choke under pressure.  Probably Jura's biggest flaw.
0-female_removed_minor=thinking,Not much of a game without an even playing field to begin with...
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,I hope you're not about to give up.  I hate quitters.
0-female_removed_minor=disappointed,Keep me interested, ~name~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,Oh, God.  I'm so sorry...I didn't mean to tease you prior to this.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,Oh my God...I'm sorry if I was taunting you before.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=surprised-horny,Oh, God.  I--you--It was brave of you to play this game.  I'm sorry...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,That's...that's horrible.  I'm sorry that happened to you...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,<i>Oh!</i>  N-no, it's alright!  You can keep them on.  It's OK.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=confused,That looks so tight...wear why it?
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=bored,My bodysuit is tight enough.  The body needs to breathe.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=disappointed,No wonder you're so polite.  That thing must choke the life out of you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=shocked,Oh, God.  Can you <i>breathe</i> in that...that outfit?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=unimpressed,...Or just keep drinking.  That'll help.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,I'd be impressed if drinking weren't so unsightly.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,It's exhausting just <i>watching</i> you drink.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=thinking,You just keep downing them...I understood the appeal once, but not anymore.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why do you carry that clunky men's gun, anyway?  I suppose there's no laser rings where you're from...
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=bored,A clunky men's gun...I didn't say anything before, but you shouldn't wave that thing around.  Laser rings are superior...
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Men of Tarak use kinetic guns like that...Barnette, one of my pilots, collects them.  But Mejare's laser rings are much cleaner...and quieter.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=impressed,A <i>men's</i> gun?  We use laser rings...they're a lot quieter, which is useful as a pirate.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=bored,I should have brought my laser ring...it's a lot harder to spot than that clunky men's firearm, too.
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=impressed,...Wait, what did you just do?
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=impressed,...Where'd they go?
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=impressed,That...looks useful.  Can this "magic" be taught?
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,You've got to focus.  Focus is key to almost anything.
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You'll be out soon at this rate.
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't choke under pressure...Jura.
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Not much of a game without an even playing field to begin with...
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I hope you're not about to give up.  I hate quitters.
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Keep me interested, ~name~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=calm,People say <i>I'm</i> quiet...you haven't said a word.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=disappointed,And people say <i>I'm</i> quiet...
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=thinking,Silence can say a lot...
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I admit, you have me beat.  Even <i>I</i> feel the need to speak sometimes.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Maybe if you lost someone dear to you, you would understand how precious life is.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Is your "darlin'" OK with you risking accidental suicide?
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,One date with the Harvest would teach you the value of life.
0-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,So you <i>are</i> trying to tease men.  If men like that, then it looks like you'll have an easy time on Tarak, Jura.
0-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Teasing?  You've already made a friend, Jura.

2-male_removing_minor=calm,That's about a fair trade for what I've removed thus far.
2-male_removing_minor=addressing,Fair enough.  Not the type to go easy on your opponents?
2-male_removing_minor,marker:state_schools=annoyed,Wish I read more about men's outfits.  Mejare's schools would have you believe they don't wear any.
2-male_removing_minor=pleased,I'm speechless.
2-male_removing_minor=disappointed,Your ~clothing~...not something a Tarakkian would wear.  They're all about resourcefulness.
2-male_removing_minor=confused,Your ~clothing~...why would a man wear that?
2-male_removing_minor=calm,...
2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Sandals?  Far too casual for any Tarakkian man to be seen wearing.  They'd be whipped for not working.
2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Sandals seem casual for a soldier.  I suppose Earth isn't as strict as Tarak in that regard.
2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Bart's the only Tarakkian man I can picture wearing sandals...and that's because he's rich.
2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-2,targetSaidMarker:cake,notSaidMarker:cap_uncomfortable,marker:cap_uncomfortable=confused,I thought for sure men just saw clothes as a means of avoiding women's germs.  You seem to really want them on.

2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=addressing,By all means, come aboard the Nirvana.  I'd be impressed if you recognized everything we had.

2-male_removed_minor=calm,...
2-male_removed_minor=addressing,We should be about even now, yes?
2-male_removed_minor=addressing,Hibiki would never let someone see fear in his eyes.  Can't say the same for you.
2-male_removed_minor=pleased,Soon you'll be showing more skin.  Of course, Mejarians believe men's skin is all bristly.
2-male_removed_minor=pleased,Rabat would probably be cheating be at this point...
2-male_removed_minor=disappointed,Games shouldn't be dragged out.  Dogfights aren't.
2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=impressed,Sandals are normal on Earth?  You must lead peaceful lives...
2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=disappointed,Don't get me wrong, Pit.  My opinion of Tarakkian culture isn't a glowing one.
2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=bored,Say what you want about Tarakkians--they manage their resources much better than the women of Mejare.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=impressed,A <i>what</i>?  You're...a <i>machine</i>?  ...I guess I'll find out soon enough.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=bored,...You're an <i>android</i>?  We have robots, but a fully human machine?  ...We'll see.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=angry,What do you mean, an <i>android</i>?  You--you look just like a man!  Don't toy with me!
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not seriously a machine?  I'll believe it when I see it...you're too human-looking.
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Are you making fun of me?  I know men aren't actually animals...
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why are you just grunting?
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=bored,Maybe men really <i>are</i> just animals...
2-female_removing_minor=pleased,The blockades are clearing out, it seems.
2-female_removing_minor=pleased,I wonder if my crewmates have any clothes like that...
2-female_removing_minor=pleased,Dita doesn't wear much more than her crop-top...and she's a little too innocent for this place.
2-female_removing_minor=thinking,I think that was in style when I was a girl...
2-female_removing_minor=disappointed,Not something I'd wear myself.
2-female_removing_minor=calm,...
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=awkward,Who--oh.  Your wrestling partner was still around...why do you need help?
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your partner?  Why's she helping you?  Can't you take them off alone?
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,How tight are those boots that you need your partner to help get them off?  Just seems impractical...
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,Do you really need help, or was that an excuse to call over your partner?  ...Not that it matters, I suppose.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I see.  And how would you rank your own abilities among all these people?
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,A whole population...must be the work of Earth's experimentation.  How would you say your powers stack up?
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=bored,This girl lives in a world full of superpowers, and I live deprived of the opposite sex.  Would you call your powers strong?
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,So there's a large variety of these powers.  Are yours particularly potent, then?
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,...Seems it was wrong of me to pry.  Still, the technology is fascinating...
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,I apologize...my crewmates who undertook it scarcely seem to remember, let alone mind.  I was curious how it worked...
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,You don't have to share anything...I was just wondering how the whole process worked.  My crewmates don't remember...
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,...I shouldn't have brought it up.  I was only hoping to learn the technology...my Oma worked as a scientist.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds impressive, but I'd rather that money went towards someone's meal.
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4,marker:ignoring_moon=bored,...
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,So, Earth is devastated where you come from because of the "Second Impact"?  The Earth I know might change your mind on that...
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,This "Second Impact" sounds like what the Harvest wants to do to Mejare.
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,I heard something about the Earth you know going through a "Second Impact"...the one <i>I</i> know isn't in great shape, either.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,This is ridiculuous.  Why am I being forced to watch a woman commit suicide?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=disappointed,Why did you keep those on for so long?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,...Is something the matter, Kyoko?  You look horrified.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=thinking,I was wondering why you were waiting to take those off...
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Kyoko...are you feeling alright?  What's the matter?
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=disappointed,...Having friends is good, too.  In case you have a moment of weakness.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=disappointed,So...you're friends with this woman?  Lovers?  What is it?
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=pleased,I would have just let her go...but then, I suppose I'd keep Dita here if she tried to run off.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,Good on you, Lyn.  Don't let your friends make mistakes.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,...Of course, women need each other.  I appreciate my crewmates, even if I try not to show it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=confused,What?  No, Parfet is a crewmate of mine.  She's got glasses like yours...and is similarly engrossed with machines.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,What?  No, I know a <i>woman</i> named Parfet.  That wasn't an insult--she's our chief engineer.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=addressing,...I <i>do</i> like parfaits, but I meant a crewmate of mine <i>named</i> Parfet.  You seemed similarly into machinery.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=addressing,Hm?  Oh no, I meant our chief engineer Parfet.  She does good work...and she's heard that joke before, don't worry.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=disappointed,I was wondering why you had that casually draped around yourself.  Like that, it would just get in the way...
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=disappointed,You shouldn't wear your jacket like that.  It'll get caught on something during combat...
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=awkward,To just drape your jacket around yourself like that...I'd find it irritating.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=bored,Not too unlike how Jura drapes her dress around herself, free-flowing and liable for accidents.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=disappointed,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,If one of my pilots pulled a stunt like this, I'd slap their necks broken.

2-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Jura's a tease, too, if you couldn't tell.  Feel free to give her advice on attracting men.

3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Sandals seem casual for a soldier.  I suppose Earth isn't as strict as Tarak in that regard.
3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=disappointed,Bart's the only Tarakkian man I can picture wearing sandals...and that's because he's rich.
3-male_removed_minor=addressing,You'll be as bare as I am soon...which I can live with.
3-male_removed_minor=addressing,What do Earth women think of you, dolling yourself up like this?

3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=confused,What?  No, Parfet is a crewmate of mine.  She's got glasses like yours...and is similarly engrossed with machines.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,What?  No, I know a <i>woman</i> named Parfet.  That wasn't an insult--she's our chief engineer.

3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I see.  And how would you rank your own abilities among all these people?
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,A whole population...must be the work of Earth's experimentation.  How would you say your powers stack up?

3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.

3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=bored,Not too unlike how Jura drapes her dress around herself, free-flowing and liable for accidents.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.

3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,...Seems it was wrong of me to pry.  Still, the technology is fascinating...
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,I apologize...my crewmates who undertook it scarcely seem to remember, let alone mind.  I was curious how it worked...
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,You don't have to share anything...I was just wondering how the whole process worked.  My crewmates don't remember...
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,...I shouldn't have brought it up.  I was only hoping to learn the technology...my Oma worked as a scientist.
3-female_removed_minor=addressing,How long does your wardrobe hold out?

3-female_removed_minor=bored,Smart strategies do tend to be boring ones...
3-female_removed_minor=bored,So much clothing.  Mejarians love fashion, but it usually doesn't cover much.
3-female_removed_minor=bored,This is mostly frustration at myself...
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,Oh, God.  I'm so sorry...I didn't mean to tease you prior to this.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=shocked,Oh my God...I'm sorry if I was taunting you before.

3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Maybe if you lost someone dear to you, you would understand how precious life is.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Is your "darlin'" OK with you risking accidental suicide?
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,One date with the Harvest would teach you the value of life.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=confused,That looks so tight...wear why it?
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=bored,My bodysuit is tight enough.  The body needs to breathe.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=disappointed,No wonder you're so polite.  That thing must choke the life out of you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=shocked,Oh, God.  Can you <i>breathe</i> in that...that outfit?
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why do you carry that clunky men's gun, anyway?  I suppose there's no laser rings where you're from...
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=bored,A clunky men's gun...I didn't say anything before, but you shouldn't wave that thing around.  Laser rings are superior...
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Men of Tarak use kinetic guns like that...Barnette, one of my pilots, collects them.  But Mejare's laser rings are much cleaner...and quieter.
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=impressed,A <i>men's</i> gun?  We use laser rings...they're a lot quieter, which is useful as a pirate.

4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=angry,What do you mean, an <i>android</i>?  You--you look just like a man!  Don't toy with me!
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=disappointed,...You're not seriously a machine?  I'll believe it when I see it...you're too human-looking.
4-female_removing_minor=calm,That you still have your ~clothing~ is a testament to your skill...
4-female_removing_minor=smug,Congratulations on your lead...but I'm not easy to put away.
4-female_removing_minor=bored,Now I'm bored <i>and</i> frustrated...
4-female_removing_minor=stretching,You're doing well, but this game can turn around in a hurry.
4-female_removing_minor=pleased,Leads are never secure in poker.  Gascogne always makes me learn that the hard way.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=disappointed,I was wondering why you had that casually draped around yourself.  Like that, it would just get in the way...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=disappointed,You shouldn't wear your jacket like that.  It'll get caught on something during combat...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=awkward,To just drape your jacket around yourself like that...I'd find it irritating.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=bored,Not too unlike how Jura drapes her dress around herself, free-flowing and liable for accidents.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,...Seems it was wrong of me to pry.  Still, the technology is fascinating...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=thinking,I apologize...my crewmates who undertook it scarcely seem to remember, let alone mind.  I was curious how it worked...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward,You don't have to share anything...I was just wondering how the whole process worked.  My crewmates don't remember...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,...I shouldn't have brought it up.  I was only hoping to learn the technology...my Oma worked as a scientist.

4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=disappointed,...Having friends is good, too.  In case you have a moment of weakness.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=disappointed,So...you're friends with this woman?  Lovers?  What is it?
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=pleased,I would have just let her go...but then, I suppose I'd keep Dita here if she tried to run off.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,Good on you, Lyn.  Don't let your friends make mistakes.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0-10=thinking,...Of course, women need each other.  I appreciate my crewmates, even if I try not to show it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=confused,What?  No, Parfet is a crewmate of mine.  She's got glasses like yours...and is similarly engrossed with machines.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=impressed,What?  No, I know a <i>woman</i> named Parfet.  That wasn't an insult--she's our chief engineer.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=addressing,...I <i>do</i> like parfaits, but I meant a crewmate of mine <i>named</i> Parfet.  You seemed similarly into machinery.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=addressing,Hm?  Oh no, I meant our chief engineer Parfet.  She does good work...and she's heard that joke before, don't worry.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=disappointed,What's that thing?  Oh, right, a bee.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=bored,Mejare <i>does</i> have bees...women need to maintain their flower gardens, after all.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee,notSaidMarker:bee_react,marker:bee_react=thinking,How'd a bee get in here?  ...How'd <i>I</i> get in here?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=disappointed,Don't bullets put you on edge?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I guess you've never suffered loss.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,This is ridiculuous.  Why am I being forced to watch a woman commit suicide?
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=awkward,Who--oh.  Your wrestling partner was still around...why do you need help?
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=disappointed,Your partner?  Why's she helping you?  Can't you take them off alone?
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=confused,How tight are those boots that you need your partner to help get them off?  Just seems impractical...
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=bored,Do you really need help, or was that an excuse to call over your partner?  ...Not that it matters, I suppose.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I was wondering why you had that casually draped around yourself.  Like that, it would just get in the way...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You shouldn't wear your jacket like that.  It'll get caught on something during combat...
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,To just drape your jacket around yourself like that...I'd find it irritating.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Well, Jura, I harp on you for having loose clothing...but you're not <i>this</i> bad about it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Let me just say I'm glad you don't drape your dress around yourself this far down, Jura.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=disappointed,Why did you keep those on for so long?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,...Is something the matter, Kyoko?  You look horrified.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=thinking,I was wondering why you were waiting to take those off...
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=confused,Kyoko...are you feeling alright?  What's the matter?

4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,...Jura, if you <i>ever</i> pulled something like this, I'd mount your head on my tailfin.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Even Hibiki isn't <i>this</i> reckless.
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,I see.  And how would you rank your own abilities among all these people?
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,A whole population...must be the work of Earth's experimentation.  How would you say your powers stack up?
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=bored,This girl lives in a world full of superpowers, and I live deprived of the opposite sex.  Would you call your powers strong?
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,So there's a large variety of these powers.  Are yours particularly potent, then?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed,Sounds impressive, but I'd rather that money went towards someone's meal.
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,So, Earth is devastated where you come from because of the "Second Impact"?  The Earth I know might change your mind on that...
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,This "Second Impact" sounds like what the Harvest wants to do to Mejare.
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=disappointed,I heard something about the Earth you know going through a "Second Impact"...the one <i>I</i> know isn't in great shape, either.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
4-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
4-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
4-female_removed_minor=bored,You'll have to forgive my disinterest.
4-female_removed_minor=unimpressed,What a game-changer.
4-female_removed_minor=bored,Dread maintenance is a lot more stimulating than this...
4-female_removed_minor=thinking,I wonder how the captain would handle poker.  She can be hard to read...
4-female_removed_minor=thinking,I wonder how B.C. would do at this.  She fooled <i>us</i>, after all...
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=unimpressed,...Or just keep drinking.  That'll help.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,I'd be impressed if drinking weren't so unsightly.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,It's exhausting just <i>watching</i> you drink.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=thinking,You just keep downing them...I understood the appeal once, but not anymore.

4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=confused,That looks so tight...wear why it?
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=bored,My bodysuit is tight enough.  The body needs to breathe.
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=disappointed,No wonder you're so polite.  That thing must choke the life out of you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=shocked,Oh, God.  Can you <i>breathe</i> in that...that outfit?

4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=unimpressed,What a surprise.  You almost died.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=bored,Considering how determined you are to kill yourself, my sympathy is limited.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Maybe if you lost someone dear to you, you would understand how precious life is.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,Is your "darlin'" OK with you risking accidental suicide?
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=annoyed,One date with the Harvest would teach you the value of life.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why do you carry that clunky men's gun, anyway?  I suppose there's no laser rings where you're from...
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=bored,A clunky men's gun...I didn't say anything before, but you shouldn't wave that thing around.  Laser rings are superior...
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Men of Tarak use kinetic guns like that...Barnette, one of my pilots, collects them.  But Mejare's laser rings are much cleaner...and quieter.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=impressed,A <i>men's</i> gun?  We use laser rings...they're a lot quieter, which is useful as a pirate.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=bored,I should have brought my laser ring...it's a lot harder to spot than that clunky men's firearm, too.
4-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=disappointed,So you <i>are</i> trying to tease men.  If men like that, Jura will be very popular on Tarak.
4-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=bored,Teasing?  You and Jura would be right at home together.
4-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=disappointed,Jura's a tease, too.  And she'd desperately want your insights on attracting men.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=calm,People say <i>I'm</i> quiet...you haven't said a word.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=disappointed,Men of Tarak use kinetic guns like that...Barnette, one of my pilots, collects them.  But Mejare's laser rings are much cleaner...and quieter.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=impressed,A <i>men's</i> gun?  We use laser rings...they're a lot quieter, which is useful as a pirate.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=addressing-2,Sounds expensive.  Couldn't you put that money towards public housing?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=bored-2,Soldiers are so enamored with their toys...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=disappointed-2,Sounds impressive, but I'd rather that money went towards someone's meal.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed-2,I see.  And how would you rank your own abilities among all these people?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed-2,A whole population...must be the work of Earth's experimentation.  How would you say your powers stack up?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=bored-2,This girl lives in a world full of superpowers, and I live deprived of the opposite sex.  Would you call your powers strong?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=impressed-2,So there's a large variety of these powers.  Are yours particularly potent, then?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=awkward-2,...Seems it was wrong of me to pry.  Still, the technology is fascinating...

-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored-2,One date with the Harvest would teach you the value of life.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=confused-2,That looks so tight...wear why it?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=addressing-2,My bodysuit is tight enough.  The body needs to breathe.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=interested-2,No wonder you're so polite.  That thing must choke the life out of you.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=thinking-2,I'm sorry if I was taunting you earlier...

-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=pleased-2,...Or just keep drinking.  That'll help.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=addressing-2,I'd be impressed if drinking weren't so unsightly.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4=impressed-2,It's exhausting just <i>watching</i> you drink.
-1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Never assume victory, ~name~...you'll get killed.

-1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Interesting outfit.  Should I look into another one, Jura?  I like that flightsuit...
-1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,You always tell me to get another outfit, Jura, but you usually wear the same one, too.  Is it because I was <i>given</i> mine?




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you have a charming personality to match your skin tone.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Good to know you'd insult someone for showing genuine concern.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=bored,...Because it's blue?  I'm no doctor...and neither are you, I hope.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...I don't know what that's supposed to mean.  I'll be sure not to show any concern for you in the future.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=annoyed,...I wasn't making fun.  I was worried about you...but now I won't be.

0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,...Secret?  What secret?
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,If your "secret" is breasts, I should remind you all women have them.  Even some men do.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=bored,Breasts are no secret.  Well, maybe on Tarak.
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,...Of course, being able to float would make it a lot easier for me to get out of <i>mine</i>.

0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,On the plus side, <i>my</i> suit zips in the front...but I think your levitation powers make it easier for you overall.
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.

0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,If you're a "princess" so desperate to remain disguised, then why did you show your face and play strip poker?
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was a disguise?  I'm not interested in your politics.

0-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=pleased,There's nothing like the women who think you wear nothing underneath the suit, is there?  ...Guess that spoils things for me.
0-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=addressing,And you've got underwear...me too, underneath mine.  It's ridiculuous how many women are surprised by that.

#lost eyepiece
1-male_removing_major=addressing,You're confirming my impressions of men.  Brave, but stupid.
1-male_removing_major=addressing,Your ~clothing~, when I have nearly everything?
1-male_removing_major=addressing,A sorry performance.  But without my eyepiece, I'm not feeling merciful.
1-male_removing_major=pleased,Too bad.  I was starting to appreciate the mystery you brought to this game for me.
1-male_removing_major=calm,Saving that till the end...perhaps we're not so different.
1-male_removing_major=impressed,...
1-male_removed_major=impressed,...
1-male_removed_major=pleased,Things are quickly getting more interesting around here.
1-male_removed_major=calm,We hosed off the men when we captured them...that was the best look I ever got.
1-male_removed_major=thinking,I think I'm starting to gather what men would rather keep covered...
1-male_removed_major=disappointed,Dita would have a waterfall of a nosebleed at this point.
1-male_removed_major=addressing,Do men feel shame?  Or are you all just wild animals?
1-male_removed_major=pleased,You're disappearing faster than my Vandread...and it's pretty fast.
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=bored,You're not seriously counting that?  I guess men aren't as brave as I thought.
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=confused,What <i>is</i> it with you and nudity?  Your body is well-maintained.
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=impressed,To so desperately protect your thing, even here...you really <i>are</i> just like a Tarakkian.
1-female_removing_major=calm,...
1-female_removing_major=calm,Sorry to see you down to your ~clothing~ already.  It <i>is</i> a style on Mejare, though.
1-female_removing_major=disappointed,See, Jura would be choking at this point.  I can never get her to stay calm.
1-female_removing_major=pleased,If you want advice on how to take care of all that skin, head to Melanus...or ask Barnette.
1-female_removing_major=disappointed,Come on, ~name~, put some effort into this.
1-female_removing_major=disappointed,I reveal so much already...and yet so little, as well.
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Can't say I'm surprised.  How many costumes can that thing give you?
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,How many costumes are available to you with that thing, anyway?
1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,So if <i>I</i> rolled that die, would my outfit change?  How many do <i>you</i> have?

1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=confused,...Am I supposed to know this song?
1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,Nothing about being a pirate is free, I promise you.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Already?  What are you doing?
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're supposed to expose yourself at the end...although I suppose no rule mandates a stripping order.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you alright, Moon?  You have smaller things.
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You can't be serious.  How cowardly can you get?
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Take your losses with dignity.  Nothing's more embarrassing than a woman who can't own up to her failures.
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wearing makeup at all is already beyond me.  To try to count it as an item is outright embarrassing...
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,<i>You</i> wouldn't count all your makeup as clothing, right, Jura?  Don't answer that if you would...
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Are you really that ashamed of your body?  Or just of losing?
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Don't waste everyone's time...have some respect for yourself.
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=disappointed,What's wrong?  Is there something you're hiding?
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=awkward,...You seem a little uncomfortable to be taking that off.  Besides the obvious reasons why.

1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=confused,Underneath...your shirt?  But why?

1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=impressed,I consider strategy my strong suit...but I can't fathom what your endgame is here.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Be my guest.  It would certainly serve you better in combat, if you can stomach not being able to tease your figure.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I fully encourage the switch.  You'll be surprised how comfortable it is...and it won't get caught on anything during raids.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I'd appreciate it if you started dressing for practicality, even if it's a byproduct of wanting to show off your body even more.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,By all means, Jura.  I think you'll find how versatile bodysuits can be...and women will still ogle you, yes.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,...Of course, being able to float would make it a lot easier for me to get out of <i>mine</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,I hope you realize how lucky you are to be blessed with these powers.  I can't slip out of my suit so easily.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,On the plus side, <i>my</i> suit zips in the front...but I think your levitation powers make it easier for you overall.
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.

1-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,See how calm she is, Jura?  You need to learn how to stay composed under pressure.
1-female_removing_major,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,If you want advice on how to take care of all that skin, head to Melanus...or ask Barnette.

1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...And for some reason this required disguising.
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is a "princess" some kind of leadership position?  Is that why you wore an unconvincing disguise?
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,If you're a "princess" so desperate to remain disguised, then why did you show your face and play strip poker?
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was a disguise?  I'm not interested in your politics.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,Already?  Well...I suppose all clothes are equal here.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,For such a conservatively dressed woman, you're having a lot of fun with this.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,Well, that didn't take long.  I should have expected someone would strip like this.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was fast.   Is that modest look just a front?

1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,If your "secret" is breasts, I should remind you all women have them.  Even some men do.
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=bored,Breasts are no secret.  Well, maybe on Tarak.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=disappointed,...I see you have a charming personality to match your skin tone.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Good to know you'd insult someone for showing genuine concern.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=bored,...Because it's blue?  I'm no doctor...and neither are you, I hope.
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...I don't know what that's supposed to mean.  I'll be sure not to show any concern for you in the future.

1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I don't understand.  You just want to lose?  Why play at all?
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is this supposed to throw us off or something?
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,...If your goal is to confuse us, it's working.

1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=disappointed,Hm?  Actual progress?  Maybe I misjudged you...Jura would love seeing all these outfits.
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=happy,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  Gascogne gave it to me.

1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But mine isn't covered in blood.
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,Bloodstains...menstrual issues, or just a murderer?
1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Well, Jura, she's certainly giving you a comprehensive look into alien women's fashion.

1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,We can already see your pubic hair...why you'd want any at all is beyond me.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,Pubic hair must be popular on Earth...and some of my crewmates don't have the diligence to stay shaven.

1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=confused,So...you two are an <i>item</i>, I assume?  And that's why you're defensive around men?

1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I hope you're proud of your reckless disregard for safety.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Danger is <i>not</i> something you joke about!

1-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=confused,Your hatred of men puts <i>Mejarians</i> to shame.  Did a man cut off your arm?

2-male_removing_major=addressing,Make your captain proud, ~name~.
2-male_removing_major=smug,Seems you're slipping behind me.  Bad place to be.

2-male_removed_major=addressing,I've heard men are a proud race.  Will you prove that wrong tonight?
2-male_removed_major=addressing,Not planning on backing out, are you?  Unbecoming of a man.
2-male_removed_major=addressing,I've heard men are a courageous species...so don't disappoint me.
2-male_removed_major=impressed,...
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=bored,You're not seriously counting that?  I guess men aren't as brave as I thought.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=confused,What <i>is</i> it with you and nudity?  Your body is well-maintained.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=impressed,To so desperately protect your thing, even here...you really <i>are</i> just like a Tarakkian.
2-female_removing_major=calm,...
2-female_removing_major=addressing,You wouldn't last five minutes against Gascogne.
2-female_removing_major=impressed,Your ~clothing~?  Thought you might have had something else...
2-female_removing_major=addressing,Come now.  I'm practically naked already.
2-female_removing_major=disappointed,I wonder if you'd make a good pilot, provided I whipped you into shape.
2-female_removing_major=disappointed,A woman should take care of herself...let's see if you do.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored,Sad how this doesn't even perturb me anymore.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored,Can't believe I've gotten used to this in the short time I've known you.
2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=impressed,This really is spectacular.  But couldn't you put it to better use than changing your clothes?
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=disappointed,What's wrong?  Is there something you're hiding?
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=awkward,...You seem a little uncomfortable to be taking that off.  Besides the obvious reasons why.
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=awkward,...Misato?  Are you alright?  You're looking all flushed.
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Isn't there any way to keep the blue one around?  She at least has social skills.
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least you aren't waving a gun around this time...but your mouth is still just as filthy.

2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,...Secret?  What secret?
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,If your "secret" is breasts, I should remind you all women have them.  Even some men do.

2-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,How many costumes are available to you with that thing, anyway?

2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was a disguise?  I'm not interested in your politics.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You can't be serious.  How cowardly can you get?
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Take your losses with dignity.  Nothing's more embarrassing than a woman who can't own up to her failures.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Wearing makeup at all is already beyond me.  To try to count it as an item is outright embarrassing...
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,<i>You</i> wouldn't count all your makeup as clothing, right, Jura?  Don't answer that if you would...
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Are you really that ashamed of your body?  Or just of losing?
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Don't waste everyone's time...have some respect for yourself.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,Already?  Well...I suppose all clothes are equal here.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,For such a conservatively dressed woman, you're having a lot of fun with this.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,Well, that didn't take long.  I should have expected someone would strip like this.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was fast.   Is that modest look just a front?
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Already?  What are you doing?

2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Be my guest.  It would certainly serve you better in combat, if you can stomach not being able to tease your figure.
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I fully encourage the switch.  You'll be surprised how comfortable it is...and it won't get caught on anything during raids.
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I'd appreciate it if you started dressing for practicality, even if it's a byproduct of wanting to show off your body even more.
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,By all means, Jura.  I think you'll find how versatile bodysuits can be...and women will still ogle you, yes.

2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.

2-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed,Take it easy, would you?  Men aren't <i>total</i> monsters.  I think they'd be afraid of your arm.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=confused,Your hatred of men puts <i>Mejarians</i> to shame.  Did a man cut off your arm?
2-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=thinking,So...you two are an <i>item</i>, I assume?  And that's why you're defensive around men...aside from losing your arm?
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,...For a second there, I was about to lose all respect for you.
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, <i>that's</i> more acceptable.  I don't know why you'd play this game if you found stripping so disagreeable.
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=disappointed,You shouldn't have made such a fuss in the first place.  It's just a game.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Sorry, but you can't give your opponent an inch.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I don't go easy on my pilots, and the same goes for you.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Dita really does have potential, but her head is in the clouds.  So she's useless at cards.
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You didn't play this game just to strip, did you?  I have Jura for that sort of thing...
2-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Barnette doesn't wear much more than her underwear...
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=disappointed,Jura would get a kick out of you.  Such an extensive look into alien women's wardrobes.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Well, you're certainly keeping us on our toes.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=disappointed,Hm?  Actual progress?  Maybe I misjudged you...Jura would love seeing all these outfits.
2-female_removed_major,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,...This is the last time I try to make small talk about an Earth woman's interests.
2-female_removed_major,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,And Jura wonders why I don't bother talking to people...
2-female_removed_major,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,...At least you're passionate about it.
2-female_removed_major,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=bored,What's "1983"?  I have no context for Earth years, Chiaki.
2-female_removed_major,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=annoyed,...Would you like it if I started rattling off my Dread's specifications?
2-female_removed_major,filter:mushroom_kingdom,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mario2,notSaidMarker:chi_mush3,priority:381,marker:chi_mush3=unimpressed,Ah, yes.  The <i>enn-ee-ess</i>.  That explains everything.  Thanks, Chiaki.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=impressed,You'd do well on our ship with a build like that...
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,The Nirvana has training rooms, if you'd like to give them a shot.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=impressed,With a build like that, you might rival B.C.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=disappointed,...I don't understand.  You just want to lose?  Why play at all?
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is this supposed to throw us off or something?
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=awkward,...If your goal is to confuse us, it's working.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=unimpressed,And the rambling drunkard claims <i>I'm</i> the agitator.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,marker:jura_sei=unimpressed,You really <i>would</i> get along with Jura...especially if your sexual comments are anything to go by.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,marker:jura_sei=unimpressed,You and Jura would have a great time thinking up new ways to make fun of me.
2-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=smug,And you've even got underwear underneath it.  So do I...it's more necessary than it seems.
2-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=pleased,There's nothing like the women who think you wear nothing underneath the suit, is there?  ...Guess that spoils things for me.
2-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=addressing,And you've got underwear...me too, underneath mine.  It's ridiculuous how many women are surprised by that.
2-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=smug,I was hoping you'd have the presence of mind to have underwear on.  So do I, underneath my suit...
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,Someone's not shy about pubic hair...I find it distasteful, but it's your choice.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,We can already see your pubic hair...why you'd want any at all is beyond me.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,Pubic hair must be popular on Earth...and some of my crewmates don't have the diligence to stay shaven.
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=happy,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  Gascogne gave it to me.
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=pleased,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But we all use the hot springs naked anyway.
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But mine isn't covered in blood.
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,Bloodstains...menstrual issues, or just a murderer?
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed,You...seem a little hostile towards men.  You didn't grow up on Mejare, did you?
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=pleased,Seems Mejarian relationships have a home on Earth, too...because you certainly aren't fond of men.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed,Take it easy, would you?  Men aren't <i>total</i> monsters.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=confused,Your hatred of men puts <i>Mejarians</i> to shame.  What did one do to you early in life?
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=confused,So...you two are an <i>item</i>, I assume?  And that's why you're defensive around men?
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=bored,Sweater...puppies?  Earthlings and their vulgar sex slang...
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Well.  Look what you were hiding away,
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=bored,...Oh.  They're larger than they look.  Great.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=impressed,You're drinking so much...don't you have to work tomorrow?
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=bored,I can't be drinking like you...I don't get days off.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=impressed,You don't have the height to be knocking all those drinks back.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=disappointed,Alcohol...empty calories.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=impressed,Compared to you, Jura's downright temperate.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,You could've killed someone!
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Barnette's a gun nut, too...but <i>she</i> has the sense to go to the firing range.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Men's kinetic weapons are so uncivilized.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I hope you're proud of your reckless disregard for safety.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,Danger is <i>not</i> something you joke about!
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Well, Jura, she's certainly giving you a comprehensive look into alien women's fashion.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Well, you're certainly keeping us on our toes.
2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Hm?  Actual progress?  Maybe I misjudged you...what do you think, Jura?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=confused,You're a..."superhero"?  I don't follow...
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=impressed,You looked like you were made of Paksis energy for a second there...
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,...I'm sorry, you're a "superhero"?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,I've heard of ladybugs...but Mejare doesn't have any.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,Mejare doesn't have any ladybugs...neither does Earth anymore, in all likelihood.


#lost bodysuit
3-male_removing_major=addressing,You can handle standing in your underwear, I assure you.
3-male_removing_major=addressing,If I can handle playing in my underwear, surely a man can.
3-male_removing_major=addressing,You're not afraid, are you, ~name~?  I always hear men say they're tougher than women.
3-male_removing_major=addressing,Exhilarating, isn't it?  The heat of a close match?
3-male_removing_major=interested,Do you still have your confidence, ~name~?  Men aren't good for much without it.
3-male_removed_major=pleased,Do men embarrass easily?  Most of my crewmates would at this point...
3-male_removed_major=addressing,This is a thinking woman's game.  Perhaps men should stick to lifting rocks and grunting.
3-male_removed_major=pleased,Dita would be snapping photos for her alien studies...and Paiway just to get some dirt on you.
3-male_removed_major=addressing,Sorry, but I can't exactly loan anything.
3-male_removed_major=addressing,We were trapped in a proto-star once.  You can handle <i>this</i>.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=bored,You're not seriously counting that?  I guess men aren't as brave as I thought.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=confused,What <i>is</i> it with you and nudity?  Your body is well-maintained.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=impressed,To so desperately protect your thing, even here...you really <i>are</i> just like a Tarakkian.
3-female_removing_major=addressing,Join me in my underwear.  Maybe then you'll appreciate female camaraderie.
3-female_removing_major=addressing,Come on, ~name~.  Women have to stick together in this big universe of ours.
3-female_removing_major=interested,It's possible to stay calm dressed like this.  Just watch me.
3-female_removing_major=interested,That's the way.  Things are heating up.
3-female_removing_major=thinking,Earth women's outfits are very individual...on Mejare it's state-approved fashion.
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=confused,Underneath...your shirt?  But why?
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=pleased,If I could undo my bra underneath my flightsuit, I wouldn't have to pirate for a living.
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=impressed,I consider strategy my strong suit...but I can't fathom what your endgame is here.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Can't say I'm surprised.  How many costumes can that thing give you?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed,How many costumes are available to you with that thing, anyway?
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused,So if <i>I</i> rolled that die, would my outfit change?  How many do <i>you</i> have?
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,Already?  Well...I suppose all clothes are equal here.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,For such a conservatively dressed woman, you're having a lot of fun with this.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,Well, that didn't take long.  I should have expected someone would strip like this.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was fast.   Is that modest look just a front?
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...And for some reason this required disguising.
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is a "princess" some kind of leadership position?  Is that why you wore an unconvincing disguise?
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,If you're a "princess" so desperate to remain disguised, then why did you show your face and play strip poker?
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was a disguise?  I'm not interested in your politics.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored,Sad how this doesn't even perturb me anymore.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored,Can't believe I've gotten used to this in the short time I've known you.
3-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=impressed,This really is spectacular.  But couldn't you put it to better use than changing your clothes?
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Isn't there any way to keep the blue one around?  She at least has social skills.
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored,At least you aren't waving a gun around this time...but your mouth is still just as filthy.
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Fortunately, your split personality seems to keep you in check better than most maniacs.
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=unimpressed,Hello, Launch.  For the third time now.
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=disappointed,What's wrong?  Is there something you're hiding?
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=awkward,...You seem a little uncomfortable to be taking that off.  Besides the obvious reasons why.
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=awkward,...Misato?  Are you alright?  You're looking all flushed.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,Already?  What are you doing?
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,You're supposed to expose yourself at the end...although I suppose no rule mandates a stripping order.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=disappointed,...Are you alright, Moon?  You have smaller things.
3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=confused,...Am I supposed to know this song?
3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=disappointed,Nothing about being a pirate is free, I promise you.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=unimpressed,You can't be serious.  How cowardly can you get?
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=disappointed,Take your losses with dignity.  Nothing's more embarrassing than a woman who can't own up to her failures.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=bored,Wearing makeup at all is already beyond me.  To try to count it as an item is outright embarrassing...
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=bored,Jura wears a lot of makeup, too...I <i>hope</i> she wouldn't try to count it as clothing.
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Are you really that ashamed of your body?  Or just of losing?
3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Don't waste everyone's time...have some respect for yourself.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased,...Of course, being able to float would make it a lot easier for me to get out of <i>mine</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing,I hope you realize how lucky you are to be blessed with these powers.  I can't slip out of my suit so easily.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,On the plus side, <i>my</i> suit zips in the front...but I think your levitation powers make it easier for you overall.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Wha--what's happening to you?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,...Ladybug?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=surprised-horny,Ladybug, you're...glowing.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked,Wha--<i>Ladybug</i>?  Are you alright?
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Be my guest.  It would certainly serve you better in combat, if you can stomach not being able to tease your figure.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I fully encourage the switch.  You'll be surprised how comfortable it is...and it won't get caught on anything during raids.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I'd appreciate it if you started dressing for practicality, even if it's a byproduct of wanting to show off your body even more.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,By all means, Jura.  I think you'll find how versatile bodysuits can be...and women will still ogle you, yes.

3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,If your "secret" is breasts, I should remind you all women have them.  Even some men do.
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=bored,Breasts are no secret.  Well, maybe on Tarak.

3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Good to know you'd insult someone for showing genuine concern.

3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking,I'm lucky.  I've been in a lot of battles, but suffered no permanent injuries.
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking,I guess I shouldn't have brought up the Second Impact...that was rude of me.  I'm sorry.
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking,I almost died in a battle once...a piece of the Paksis got lodged in my head.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=confused,You're a..."superhero"?  I don't follow...
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=impressed,You looked like you were made of Paksis energy for a second there...
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,...I'm sorry, you're a "superhero"?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,I've heard of ladybugs...but Mejare doesn't have any.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,marker:Mejare_few_animals=thinking,Mejare doesn't have any ladybugs...neither does Earth anymore, in all likelihood.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=calm,You didn't have to be ashamed of your face.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=calm,Why hide your face?  You look perfectly fine.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=impressed,I didn't know Earth women had skin colors like that...
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,Someone's not shy about pubic hair...I find it distasteful, but it's your choice.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,We can already see your pubic hair...why you'd want any at all is beyond me.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,Pubic hair must be popular on Earth...and some of my crewmates don't have the diligence to stay shaven.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=addressing,...For a second there, I was about to lose all respect for you.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=bored,...Well, <i>that's</i> more acceptable.  I don't know why you'd play this game if you found stripping so disagreeable.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=disappointed,You shouldn't have made such a fuss in the first place.  It's just a game.

3-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=interested,Good to see you had underwear on...and even better, it's supportive.  You're more sensible than you look.
3-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=smug,You might be more embarrassed, Ochako, but that supportive training gear tells me you're a smart woman.
3-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=interested,A bodysuit <i>and</i> athletic underwear?  I had no idea our fashion senses were that similar...or that you were so sensible.
3-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=happy,Maybe I can't fly like you, Ochako, but we're not so different.  I like women smart enough to wear something supportive.
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=happy,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  Gascogne gave it to me.
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=pleased,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But we all use the hot springs naked anyway.
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But mine isn't covered in blood.
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=disappointed,Bloodstains...menstrual issues, or just a murderer?

3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=impressed,Nice build.  I could learn something from you...
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=impressed,We should exercise together...I wonder if you could keep up with me.
3-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=calm,Our ship has physical records, you know.  You could challenge them...
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry,You could've killed someone!
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Barnette's a gun nut, too...but <i>she</i> has the sense to go to the firing range.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,Men's kinetic weapons are so uncivilized.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,I hope you're proud of your reckless disregard for safety.

3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Well, Jura, she's certainly giving you a comprehensive look into alien women's fashion.
3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Well, you're certainly keeping us on our toes.

3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_sei=unimpressed,...You want to handle this girl, Jura?  I think you two would get along better.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_sei=unimpressed,Can you take over this conversation, Jura?  I'm sure you and Sei can find new ways to make fun of me.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed,You...seem a little hostile towards men.  Mejarian soldiers would certainly like robotic arms.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed,Seems Mejarian relationships have a home on Earth, too...because you certainly aren't fond of men.  Is that how you lost your arm?
3-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed,Take it easy, would you?  Men aren't <i>total</i> monsters.  I think they'd be afraid of your arm.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=confused,Your hatred of men puts <i>Mejarians</i> to shame.  Did a man cut off your arm?
3-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=thinking,So...you two are an <i>item</i>, I assume?  And that's why you're defensive around men...aside from losing your arm?
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=calm,See?  No reason to hide your face.  You look fine.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=disappointed,Why were you hiding your face in the first place?  Are you some kind of outlaw?

4-male_removing_major=addressing,Don't you have more than your ~clothing~?
4-male_removing_major=pleased,You don't have much left.  Maybe Rabat would sell you a poncho like his.

4-male_removed_major=addressing,You didn't think I'd ever lose to a <i>man</i>, did you?

4-male_removed_major=addressing,I've kept a cool head in worse situations.
4-male_removed_major=interested,You'll be like me in no time.  Shouldn't be too embarrassing for an Earth man, right?
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=bored,You're not seriously counting that?  I guess men aren't as brave as I thought.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=confused,What <i>is</i> it with you and nudity?  Your body is well-maintained.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=impressed,To so desperately protect your thing, even here...you really <i>are</i> just like a Tarakkian.
4-female_removing_major=addressing,If I can handle it, you can.

4-female_removing_major=pleased,Nothing wrong with showing skin.  Ask Barnette.
4-female_removing_major=pleased,I wonder if your ~clothing~ would look good on me...
4-female_removing_major=awkward,I really don't have much besides my flightsuit...and that smock I sleep in.
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=confused,You're a..."princess"?  ...And for some reason this required disguising.
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,Is a "princess" some kind of leadership position?  Is that why you wore an unconvincing disguise?
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,If you're a "princess" so desperate to remain disguised, then why did you show your face and play strip poker?
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=disappointed,That was a disguise?  I'm not interested in your politics.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,...Secret?  What secret?
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,If your "secret" is breasts, I should remind you all women have them.  Even some men do.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=bored,Breasts are no secret.  Well, maybe on Tarak.
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored,Sad how this doesn't even perturb me anymore.
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored,Can't believe I've gotten used to this in the short time I've known you.
4-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=impressed,This really is spectacular.  But couldn't you put it to better use than changing your clothes?
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=confused,Underneath...your shirt?  But why?

4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=disappointed,Already?  Well...I suppose all clothes are equal here.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,For such a conservatively dressed woman, you're having a lot of fun with this.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma,targetStage:1=bored,Well, that didn't take long.  I should have expected someone would strip like this.

4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,On the plus side, <i>my</i> suit zips in the front...but I think your levitation powers make it easier for you overall.
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=smug,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.

-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=unimpressed,...Good to know you'd insult someone for showing genuine concern.

-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=thinking,Life is uncertain enough.  I'd like my outfit to not be up to chance.
-3-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=thinking,This is one of the few outfits I have...can't imagine leaving that up to a dice roll.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=impressed,My bodysuit is tight enough...I'd never wear <i>that</i> underneath it.

-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-2-pleased,Be my guest.  It would certainly serve you better in combat, if you can stomach not being able to tease your figure.

-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=mast-4-pleased,On the plus side, <i>my</i> suit zips in the front...but I think your levitation powers make it easier for you overall.
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=mast-3-pleased,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.

-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=mast-2-pleased,Why were you hiding your face in the first place?  Are you some kind of outlaw?
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=mast-3-pleased,Celtic hid her whole body for a while...because she was afraid of men's germs.  Why were <i>you</i> doing it?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=mast-2-pleased,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  Gascogne gave it to me.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=mast-3-pleased,...I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But we all use the hot springs naked anyway.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,I actually own a swimsuit like that.  But mine isn't covered in blood.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,Bloodstains...menstrual issues, or just a murderer?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,You're drinking so much...you put Jura to shame.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,I can't be drinking like you...I don't get days off.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,You don't have the height to be knocking all those drinks back.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Alcohol...empty calories.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,You're temperate next to this girl, Jura.  But, sitting here masturbating, I suppose I have no right to be judgmental.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=mast-2-disappointed,You are, without a doubt, the strangest woman I've ever met.  Living your whole life up to chance?  The universe is dangerous...
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,What exactly do you wear on a regular basis?
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=mast-2-disappointed,Life is uncertain enough.  I'd like my outfit to not be up to chance.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,That was one of the few outfits I have...can't imagine leaving that up to a dice roll.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=mast-4-pleased,You've taken care of your body...all the better for me.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=mast-4-pleased,I can appreciate a fit woman...professionally and otherwise.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=mast-2-pleased,You've kept your body fit, so be proud of it...
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Well, Jura, she's certainly giving you a comprehensive look into alien women's fashion.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Well, you're certainly keeping us on our toes.
-2-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Hm?  Actual progress?  Maybe I misjudged you...what do you think, Jura?

-1-male_removing_major=pleased-2,Things are coming to an end...I already did.
-1-male_removing_major=addressing-2,Are we reaching a conclusion?  You should always savor the climax.
-1-male_removing_major=addressing-2,Showing a lot of skin, ~name~.  Maybe you'd fit in on Melanus.
-1-male_removing_major=pleased-2,Down to your ~clothing~...never thought men wore more than loincloths.
-1-male_removing_major=happy-2,This is intense...even though I'm out already.
-1-male_removed_major=pleased-2,I'm still so wet...a symbol of my loss.
-1-male_removed_major=addressing-2,Keep going, and perhaps I'll put on another show for you.
-1-male_removed_major=addressing-2,I've squirted my interest away...but there's still a scientific appeal here.
-1-male_removed_major=interested-2,I <i>do</i> want to see you lose.  It'll be illustrative for me...
-1-male_removed_major=happy-2,I don't like spectating, but this is alright.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=unimpressed-2,You're not seriously counting that?  I guess men aren't as brave as I thought.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=disappointed-2,What <i>is</i> it with you and nudity?  Your body is well-maintained.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=disappointed-2,To so desperately protect your thing, even here...you really <i>are</i> just like a Tarakkian.
-1-female_removing_major=addressing-2,An excellent choice...for an excellent opponent.
-1-female_removing_major=interested-2,What else are you hiding?
-1-female_removing_major=impressed-2,Why didn't we all start with the same amount of clothes?
-1-female_removing_major=interested-2,You're full of surprises, ~name~.  It's a good trait in a woman.
-1-female_removing_major=pleased-2,...
-1-female_removing_major=stretching-2,I don't mind a little skin.  Not at this point, anyway...nothing to lose.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased-2,...Of course, being able to float would make it a lot easier for me to get out of <i>mine</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=addressing-2,I hope you realize how lucky you are to be blessed with these powers.  I can't slip out of my suit so easily.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=pleased-2,On the plus side, <i>my</i> suit zips in the front...but I think your levitation powers make it easier for you overall.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=interested-2,I suppose floating makes removing your suit much easier than it is for me.  Still, it can't be fun wrestling with a zipper in the back.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=confused-2,Underneath...your shirt?  But why?
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=addressing-2,If I could undo my bra underneath my flightsuit, I wouldn't have to pirate for a living.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=confused-2,I consider strategy my strong suit...but I can't fathom what your endgame is here.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=stretching-2,...Am I supposed to know this song?  It's a little catchy, I suppose.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=addressing-2,Nothing about being a pirate is free, I promise you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed-2,Isn't there any way to keep the blue one around?  She at least has social skills.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=bored-2,At least you aren't waving a gun around this time...but your mouth is still just as filthy.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=unimpressed-2,Fortunately, your split personality seems to keep you in check better than most maniacs.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=disappointed-2,Hello, Launch.  For the third time now.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Be my guest.  It would certainly serve you better in combat, if you can stomach not being able to tease your figure.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,I fully encourage the switch.  You'll be surprised how comfortable it is...and it won't get caught on anything during raids.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,I'd appreciate it if you started dressing for practicality, even if it's a byproduct of wanting to show off your body even more.
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,By all means, Jura.  I think you'll find how versatile bodysuits can be...and women will still ogle you, yes.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=bored-2,Can't say I'm surprised.  How many costumes can that thing give you?
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=disappointed-2,How many costumes are available to you with that thing, anyway?
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:4=confused-2,So if <i>I</i> rolled that die, would my outfit change?  How many do <i>you</i> have?
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored-2,Sad how this doesn't even perturb me anymore.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=disappointed-2,Can't believe I've gotten used to this in the short time I've known you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=disappointed-2,This really is spectacular.  But couldn't you put it to better use than changing your clothes?
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=impressed-2,What's wrong?  Is there something you're hiding?
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=disappointed-2,...You seem a little uncomfortable to be taking that off.  Besides the obvious reasons why.
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=impressed-2,...Misato?  Are you alright?  You're looking all flushed.
-1-female_removed_major=addressing-2,You're showing a lot more skin now.  Melanus could use a woman like you.
-1-female_removed_major=interested-2,You can still pull through, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_major=horny-2,........
-1-female_removed_major=interested-2,You have to show me what an Earth woman's wardrobe looks like sometime...
-1-female_removed_major=addressing-2,I hope you're proud of winning only by wearing more clothing in the first place.
-1-female_removed_major=happy-2,I believe in you, ~name~.  Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=unimpressed-2,And the rambling drunkard claims <i>I'm</i> the agitator.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,marker:jura_sei=addressing-2,You really <i>would</i> get along with Jura, especially if you sexual comments are anything to go by.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,marker:jura_sei=pleased-2,You and Jura would have a great time thinking up new ways to make fun of me.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=horny-2,You must exercise a lot...
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=thinking-2,I <i>wish</i> I looked as good as you...
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=happy-2,Don't let anyone tell you you aren't in shape...
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=thinking-2,You are, without a doubt, the strangest woman I've ever met.  Living your whole life up to chance?  The universe is dangerous...
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=disappointed-2,What exactly do you wear on a regular basis?
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=thinking-2,Life is uncertain enough.  I'd like my outfit to not be up to chance.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6=thinking-2,That was one of the few outfits I have...can't imagine leaving that up to a dice roll.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored-2,Jura would get a kick out of you.  Such an extensive look into alien women's wardrobes.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=bored-2,Well, you're certainly keeping us on our toes.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5=impressed-2,Hm?  Actual progress?  Maybe I misjudged you...Jura would love seeing all these outfits.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy-2,You didn't have to be ashamed of your face.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=interested-2,Why hide your face?  You look perfectly fine.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=impressed-2,I didn't know Earth women had skin colors like that...
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Well, Jura, she's certainly giving you a comprehensive look into alien women's fashion.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,Well, you're certainly keeping us on our toes.
-1-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed-2,Hm?  Actual progress?  Maybe I misjudged you...what do you think, Jura?
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=addressing-2,You seem a little hostile towards men.  You didn't grow up on Mejare, did you?  Men don't seem so bad anymore...
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=interested-2,Seems Mejarian relationships have a home on Earth, too...I'm starting to warm up to men, honestly.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=pleased-2,Take it easy, would you?  Men aren't <i>total</i> monsters...either that, or I just masturbated to monsters.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=pleased-2,Your hatred of men puts <i>Mejarians</i> to shame.  They don't seem so bad to <i>me</i> anymore.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=pleased-2,So...you two are an <i>item</i>, I assume?  And that's why you're defensive around men?
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=pleased-2,You...seem a little hostile towards men.  Mejarian soliders would certainly like robotic arms.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=addressing-2,Seems Mejarian relationships have a home on Earth, too...because you certainly aren't fond of men.  Is that how you lost your arm?
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=bored-2,Take it easy, would you?  Men aren't <i>total</i> monsters.  I think they'd be afraid of your arm.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=impressed-2,Your hatred of men puts <i>Mejarians</i> to shame.  Did a man cut off your arm?
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang_v4,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake,totalMales:1-2=disappointed-2,So...you two are an <i>item</i>, I assume?  And that's why you're defensive around men...aside from losing your arm?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed-2,And the rambling drunkard claims <i>I'm</i> the agitator.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_sei=addressing-2,So many sexual comments.  You have a lot in common with Earth women, Jura.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_sei=stretching-2,You can make fun of me with Jura if you want.  I'm feeling better now.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=shocked-2,Oh, God.  I--didn't realize.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking-2,Oh...I'm sorry.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking-2,I'm lucky.  I've been in a lot of battles, but suffered no permanent injuries.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking-2,I guess I shouldn't have brought up the Second Impact...that was rude of me.  I'm sorry.
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=thinking-2,I almost died in a battle once...a piece of the Paksis got lodged in my head.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=happy-2,See?  No reason to hide your face.  You look fine.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=interested-2,Why were you hiding your face in the first place?  Are you some kind of outlaw?
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=addressing-2,Celtic hid her whole body for a while...because she was afraid of men's germs.  Why were <i>you</i> doing it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,You're drinking so much...you put Jura to shame.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=bored-2,I can't be drinking like you...I don't get days off.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,You don't have the height to be knocking all those drinks back.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,Alcohol...empty calories.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,You're temperate compared to this girl, Jura.  Must be the bad influence of Earth men.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=angry-2,You could've killed someone!
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed-2,Barnette's a gun nut, too...but <i>she</i> has the sense to go to the firing range.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=bored-2,Men's kinetic weapons are so uncivilized.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed-2,I hope you're proud of your reckless disregard for safety.

-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=pleased-2,Compared to you, Jura's downright temperate.
-1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=interested-2,Good to see you had underwear on...and even better, it's supportive.  You're more sensible than you look.
-1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=interested-2,You might be more embarrassed, Ochako, but that supportive training gear tells me you're a smart woman.
-1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=horny-2,A bodysuit <i>and</i> athletic underwear?  I had no idea our fashion senses were that similar...or that you were so sensible.
-1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=happy-2,Maybe I can't fly like you, Ochako, but we're not so different.  I like women smart enough to wear something supportive.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,Someone's not shy about pubic hair...I find it distasteful, but it's your choice.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,We can already see your pubic hair...why you'd want any at all is beyond me.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,Pubic hair must be popular on Earth...and some of my crewmates don't have the diligence to stay shaven.




#OPPONENT REVEALING CHEST OR CROTCH

#fully clothed
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,Couldn't you make me lose <i>one</i> hand before exposing yourself?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,The male upper body...?  Interesting.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,I wonder if it'll match the pictures in Duero's book.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=surprised-horny,...This is new.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I've pushed you to nudity already?  I guess men can't play cards.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nintendo?  ...<i>Character</i>?  What are you on about?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nint--<i>what</i>?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,Breaking character?  Are you some kind of street performer?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,You don't look all that muscular.  Neither is Hibiki, but he's got more of a spine.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, though he'd reach it a lot quicker.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  They're ruthlessly efficient, just like Tarakkians themselves.
0-male_chest_is_visible=awkward,You're in good shape...I think.
0-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Good to see you take care of yourself.  Can't always trust a man to do that.
0-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,You're in good shape.  I respect that, even for a man.
0-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,If only I could get my crewmates into better shape.
0-male_chest_is_visible=surprised-horny,I've...never seen a man like this.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...maybe I was mistaken.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  I don't see the point of them on a man...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I know why <i>women</i> have nipples...but I could never picture a man nursing his young.  So you don't have any?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,First contact, you might say.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,So we'll be seeing his...<i>tube</i>?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,Your...thing?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=confused,Your tube, right?  It's...shaped like a tube?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,And here I thought I'd have to work a little to see this...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=unimpressed,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=shocked,I--I haven't prepared myself for this.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,A man's thing?  A-already?

0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing,A textbook example.  I've <i>read</i> a textbook on this.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,Why did you come here with nothing on?  You're so carefree...do you just like being seen?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,For a strange hybrid woman, you seem quite at peace with yourself...showing up naked.  That's admirable...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Was this game just an excuse to shave yourself?  You're so positive about it, I can't even be annoyed.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,It's irritating enough to strip naked...to <i>arrive</i> naked and perform personal hygiene here shows a lot of self-confidence.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Maybe I could learn from how at peace you are with your body...just arriving naked and smiling the entire time.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=impressed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=awkward,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,So now you're even more naked than before...well, I support the move.  Mejare values cleanliness on the body.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Mejare treats body hair like a plague to be eradicated...so you've given me mixed feelings.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=bored,Now you'd fit right in on Mejare.  Had you come there looking how you did before, they'd have forcibly shaved you.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,On my home planet, women value shaving to an extreme...the goal is to look as sleek as possible.  You certainly fit the bill now.

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...

1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nint--<i>what</i>?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,Breaking character?  Are you some kind of street performer?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,You don't look all that muscular.  Neither is Hibiki, but he's got more of a spine.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, though he'd reach it a lot quicker.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  They're ruthlessly efficient, just like Tarakkians themselves.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,A man's upper body...?  I guess I should have expected to see one.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Enjoy the eye candy, Jura.  This is why you came here, right?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Never got a good look at a man's chest.  Dazzle me.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,This is the extra fun of beating a man...education.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,My heart's all aflutter.
1-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,Fascinating...you're built like the polar opposite of a woman.
1-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,It's like someone inverted a woman's body...
1-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,So much blockier than a woman...hairier, too.
1-male_chest_is_visible=addressing,You've been eating well.  You should try Tarakkian food pellets.
1-male_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Men have it so easy gaining muscle...and being bigger in general.
1-male_chest_is_visible=surprised-horny,...
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...maybe I was mistaken.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  I don't see the point of them on a man...
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I know why <i>women</i> have nipples...but I could never picture a man nursing his young.  So you don't have any?
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,This is all very interesting...I've never seen a live one before.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,At least I'm getting <i>something</i> out of this easy victory.

1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Couldn't you have put up more of a challenge?  Maybe then I'd find this tiltillating.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,I'd never ask a man personally to see this...
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=shocked,I--I haven't prepared myself for this.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,A man's thing?  A-already?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,It's a little early to be stripping naked, isn't it?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,So soon...this is bizarre.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,Y-You're not pulling your thing out already?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=unimpressed,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,For Tarakkians' sake, I hope you're an outlier.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Maybe Dita would be less obsessed with men if I introduced you two.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...So what size do women prefer?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,Is that thing fully grown?  I'm...sort of lost here.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,I thought adult men's...<i>things</i> were larger than that.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,It looks so vulnerable.  Why don't you store sperm internally?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,So that's your...what's the word?  Penis?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,"Penis."  Awkward-sounding word, awkward-looking organ...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Those are testes in the back, right?  Or...tessicles?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,That's "erect," right?  You're erect?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,How can you have one passage for urine <i>and</i> semen?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=pleased,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,This is happening too fast...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I knew I might see this, coming here...but I didn't prepare myself for it.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,So that's what one looks like.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...<i>Visual</i> curiosity.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,Oh dear.  Even Jura would back out at the sight of that thing.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=confused,Doesn't that thing annoy you, always taking up so much space?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Do women like them that big?  Looks cumbersome.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=addressing,I've read it needs blood to get hard.  Guess there wasn't much left for your brain.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Are you erect or flaccid?  I forget which is which...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,If you're popular with Earth women, they must not feel any pain.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Uh...are you <i>sure</i> you want to deal with these things, Jura?  I mean, it looks like it'd split you in two.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,Doesn't that thing annoy you, always taking up so much space?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Do women like them that big?  Looks cumbersome.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I've read it needs blood to get hard.  Guess there wasn't much left for your brain.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,Are you erect or flaccid?  I forget which is which...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=surprised-horny,If you're popular with Earth women, they must not feel any pain.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,These are the moments you all came here for.  I'm just in it for the cards.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,I'm sure they're fine.  It's losing you should be worried about.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Just do it.  Breasts aren't what make a woman.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=thinking,Hang in there.  You can already see the shape of mine...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,I didn't think winning would be <i>this</i> easy.  Earth women are soft.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Naked already?  That's a little sad, ~name~.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Did you play this game just to strip?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=unimpressed,Owning your sexuality is one thing...but you're a little <i>too</i> eager.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=bored,I wanted a challenge tonight...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Already?  Well, let's see them.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Is nudity even on your radar?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Aren't you getting tired of this?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=disappointed,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,What about...your mask?  I guess you wouldn't be recognized as your public self without it...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,Your--breasts?  Already?  Don't you have the mask still?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=addressing,Wha--are you sure?  The leotard already?  ...Well, I won't stop you...it's not my fault when the enemy makes mistakes.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=disappointed,It isn't fun to beat an opponent who makes mistakes.  You still have your mask.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...What do you mean that's <i>fur</i>?  You're not serious?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You're--<i>shaving</i>?  As in, it's fur?  But how?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,That's your <i>pubic</i> hair?  Who are you?  <i>What</i> are you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, what?  You're shaving?  Isn't that underwear?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=thinking,I'm not sure if I envy your confidence or not.  Maybe I do, but not the reckless abandon with sex that seems to accompany it.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=unimpressed,Brace yourselves.  Here comes the envy of every woman on Mejare...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=bored,You really are having the time of your life, Jura.  Too bad I can't get you approach piloting with this sort of enthusiasm.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=bored,...Having fun, Jura?  Well, that makes one of us.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Again</i>?  At least you can only expose yourself so many times.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=angry,What is the <i>matter</i> with you?  You're talking like you're not human!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,I'll never understand people who <i>want</i> to be seen naked.  Even Jura draws out the process.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I should have figured you'd be just as obscene as last time.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You can ask Jura where all the rum on our ship goes.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=disappointed,Well, Jura, time to put your underwear claims to the test.  I really hope you were just teasing...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=bored,<i>Please</i> tell me you weren't serious about not wearing underwear.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=thinking,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right?  Have some respect for yourself...and Barnette.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=thinking,Can't believe you've already been pushed this far...and that you may not have anything beneath it.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,What are you going on about now?  What are you going to do?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=confused,...Wait, what did you just say you could do?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,...I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Dita's young, but hers are big...must be Mejarian genetics.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,...So where are they?  Earth women's <i>get</i> that small?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,You're reminding of me of Paiway.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...How old are you again?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,It's OK.  I've read breast size has little to do with milk production...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=impressed,...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=impressed,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You didn't know the die could do that?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Seems you take care of yourself, which is always good to see a woman do.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Healthy size.  Regular massages are important, too.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Jura likes to flaunt hers...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=disappointed,That's just average to a Mejarian...we're voluptuous by design.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=disappointed,You'd fit right in on the Nirvana.  Mejarians tend to be buxom.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,M-magic?  What are you--
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=surprised-horny,That's--my God.  You <i>are</i> a fairy.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,Magic?  You really <i>are</i> a fairy...though based on how you treat men, not the ones I read about as a girl.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shocked,I--you--that's incredible!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Jura, I'm sorry if I've ever called you flirtatious.  This girl puts you to shame.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=disappointed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.  Speaking of which, Jura, want to tell her the classics?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Seems you take care of yourself, which is always good to see a woman do.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,Healthy size.  Regular massages are important, too.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Not feeling too self-conscious, Jura?  Thought not...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,That's just average to a Mejarian...we're voluptuous by design.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,You'd fit right in on the Nirvana.  Mejarians tend to be buxom.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,This really is surprising.  Maybe I should have figured someone would try to shake us by doing this...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Perhaps this is the best way to play...expose yourself early to avoid embarrassment later.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=addressing,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,I'm guessing Earth men <i>also</i> prefer the large ones.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,You must be proud of them.  Wonder what <i>that</i> feels like.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,Yes.  Very nice.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,You and Jura ought to compare.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,..........
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,At least with the leotard I can understand needing help.  Especially considering the...<i>size</i> of your backside.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...a lot to handle.  And you developed all that muscle?  I've got a lot of respect for you...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,Oh, your...backside.  It's a lot...but in a good way.  I can tell you worked hard to give it that volume...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,All that muscle...Mejare hardly pays attention to the butt, but I like how a dedicated woman can improve hers.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=impressed,...You're a cat.  Not dressed as one, but...a cat.  Earth is something else...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Your breasts out already...and you say you're some kind of cat-woman hybrid?  <i>Earth</i>...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=annoyed,Is <i>this</i> what Earth's been doing with its stolen organs?  Generating mutant catwomen?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:mejare_few_animals=surprised-horny,Mejare has cats in zoos...but almost no animals at all.  Too see a cat, and one combined with a woman...it's unreal.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,At least you spoiled the surprise ahead of time.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=bored,...Why exactly are you ashamed of that?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,How deceiving.  Congratulations.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=stressed,...Your modesty is flattering.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=impressed,...Oh.  OK...thank God there's a shred of modesty in there somewhere.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=unimpressed,Well, it certainly isn't <i>much</i>, but at least it's there.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=bored,There's no doubt in my mind you wear that all the time, and not just for this game...but at least it's <i>something</i>.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetSaidMarker:underwear=awkward,You could do with a bra, as well...your dress only helps so much.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=disappointed,Whatever bodily comparisons I make are against my better nature...piloting skills are a better measure of worth.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=unimpressed,I'd tell you to keep your vanity to yourself, but I suppose that's paradoxical.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=bored,Well, there they are.  Excuse me for not being thrilled...being flashed in the spa tends to desensitize you.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,targetNotSaidMarker:underwear=addressing,I'd rather compare flight performances.  Barnette puts in more effort than you do...perhaps a demotion is in order.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...As expected.  I've known you for too long.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,See?  Hardly anything, but enough to to play with...for your viewing pleasure.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,Sometimes I hate being right.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,At least she's wearing underwear.  <i>That</i> I didn't take as a given.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm not stopping.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  We're going to continue.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=awkward,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,I'm not stopping just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=pleased,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep playing.  You should have been more careful.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,I'm guessing Earth men <i>also</i> prefer the large ones.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,You must be proud of them.  Wonder what <i>that</i> feels like.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,Yes.  Very nice.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You comparing, Jura?  She might give you a run for your money...not that you'd care.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,..........
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Don't be dramatic about it.  Nothing special about a woman's body.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,No different than our changing stations.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,Shame can be crippling...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking,Have respect for yourself.  Even Mejare gets that right...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Jura always gives me an eyeful in the showers anyway.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,...Did you not expect that to happen?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,A...<i>selfie</i>?  Oh...well, just leave me out of it, clothes or not.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=unimpressed,If that means what I think it does, all that I ask is that I'm not in the background.  Have fun being nude together.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,What's a "selfie"?  Is it--oh.  I see...and I want nothing to do with it, even if I'm still mostly dressed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,I'm going to ask you don't include <i>me</i> this time.  I'd rather not be in a photo where Jura's embarrassing herself.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,A...<i>selfie</i>?  Oh...well, just leave me out of it, clothes or not.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,If that means what I think it does, all that I ask is that I'm not in the background.  Have fun being nude together.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Next to girls like this, Jura, you're the picture of chastity.  At least you've limited yourself to women thus far.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,Why did you come here with nothing on?  You're so carefree...do you just like being seen?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,For a strange hybrid woman, you seem quite at peace with yourself...showing up naked.  That's admirable...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Was this game just an excuse to shave yourself?  You're so positive about it, I can't even be annoyed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,It's irritating enough to strip naked...to <i>arrive</i> naked and perform personal hygiene here shows a lot of self-confidence.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Maybe I could learn from how at peace you are with your body...just arriving naked and smiling the entire time.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored,Just making sure you're fit to serve...wouldn't want any issues in the middle of a mission.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=unimpressed,Skirting around the issue, like always.  Guess that means you're the same as ever.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=unimpressed,Getting a straight answer out of you is like wringing blood from a robot.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored,Forget I said anything, then...just lose the underwear.  Have your fun.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Don't be dramatic about it.  Nothing special about a woman's body.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=calm,No different than our changing stations.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Shame can be crippling...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Have respect for yourself.  Even Mejare gets that right...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,If you wanted me to stare at breasts, Jura, we could've just showered like always.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=thinking,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=impressed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=awkward,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,You look healthy enough.  Earthlings are big fans of health.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Looks comfortable.  This flightsuit can start to itch...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=impressed,Are you...getting wet?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,Exactly what the Harvest wants Mejare for...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I guess I'm no better, agreeing to play this...
1-female_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,Come anywhere near me with that webbing and the Nirvana will be paying your planet a visit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,<i>Now</i> what are you doing?  Attacking us for losing?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Jura always <i>did</i> want to be a model.  You have no idea how much this means to her.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,...I see.  I wouldn't live my life based on what men want, though.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=awkward,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...I was more concerned with the cards.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,Jura always <i>did</i> want to be a model.  You have no idea how much this means to her.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,And after all that, you look perfectly fine.  What was the issue with this?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=bored,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=unimpressed,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I've always thought shaved looks better...more functional, too.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=awkward,What did you expect?  ...Not sure what I did.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing,Even the die is getting sick of this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=smug,If this doesn't prove the existence of fate, I don't know what does.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=bored,...You really <i>did</i> have this all planned out.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=disappointed,Maybe I'd lighten up if I were naked, I'd agree.  Too bad you seem incapable of stripping me.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=bored,Tell you what, Jura, I'll fly you out here whenever you want if it takes the edge off.  But I'm not playing next time.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=bored,I <i>wish</i> I got this much enjoyment out of being indecent.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=addressing,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,So now you're even more naked than before...well, I support the move.  Mejare values cleanliness on the body.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Mejare treats body hair like a plague to be eradicated...so you've given me mixed feelings.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=bored,Now you'd fit right in on Mejare.  Had you come there looking how you did before, they'd have forcibly shaved you.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,On my home planet, women value shaving to an extreme...the goal is to look as sleek as possible.  You certainly fit the bill now.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,I've only gotten some glimpses of Bart's...from when he's helming the ship.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,You'd be called a witch for seeing this on Mejare...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Well, I can tell you've got Hibiki beat already...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,This is your best chance of distracting me...besides that tube of yours.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,You don't look all that muscular.  Neither is Hibiki, but he's got more of a spine.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, though he'd reach it a lot quicker.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  They're ruthlessly efficient, just like Tarakkians themselves.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
2-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,I'm not sure women <i>have</i> those muscles...
2-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,Wow, men really <i>can</i> gain muscle better...
2-male_chest_is_visible=surprised-horny,N-not bad.
2-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Worth the...<i>weight</i>.
2-male_chest_is_visible=addressing,So, how much can you lift?  That's a good use for a man.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...maybe I was mistaken.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  I don't see the point of them on a man...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I know why <i>women</i> have nipples...but I could never picture a man nursing his young.  So you don't have any?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,I think I've earned my prize.  Let's see that tube-thing.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,I know a certain spaceship whose crew would want to see this.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=surprised-horny,Your...thing?  The tube?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Jura better not blab about me playing this.  Everyone will ask me what your thing looks like...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Won't you satisfy my curiosity, ~name~?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=shocked,I--I haven't prepared myself for this.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,A man's thing?  A-already?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,It's a little early to be stripping naked, isn't it?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,So soon...this is bizarre.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=surprised-horny,Y-You're not pulling your thing out already?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=unimpressed,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,Seems I wasn't missing much all these years.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...Are you an adult, ~name~?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,I didn't know they got that small...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,I've read that the penis and clitoris are made from analogous tissue...you're living proof.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,If you were shorter, it might look bigger...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,I was told those spheres in the back were red-hot...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=pleased,I wonder how you compare to the men of the Nirvana...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Good size...not that I have much of a reference point.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=confused,It just...<i>dangles</i> like that?  I thought it was retractable...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Looks like a mushroom in the brush.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Bart always covers his when he's piloting the ship...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,So that's what one looks like.  In person, I mean.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,For my first one...I suppose yours is decent.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Staring one in the face...I didn't know they could stare back.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=pleased,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...<i>Visual</i> curiosity.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=impressed,Dita's always trying to sneak peeks at the men's...you'd make it easy for her.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,They, er, sure come in a variety of sizes.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=confused,Why is there such a variety in size?  It's not like women can tell from sight...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,Oh, God.  That's too big for a woman...right?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,They're not <i>all</i> that big, right?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=impressed,...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Let us see.  I won't judge you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,You knew what you signed up for.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,Don't be a coward, ~name~.  That's a lot worse than public nudity.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I don't plan on having to do this.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,They're just breasts, ~name~.  There's more important things to worry about.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You can ask Jura where all the rum on our ship goes.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,What are you going on about now?  What are you going to do?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=confused,...Wait, what did you just say you could do?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,...I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...What do you mean that's <i>fur</i>?  You're not serious?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You're--<i>shaving</i>?  As in, it's fur?  But how?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,That's your <i>pubic</i> hair?  Who are you?  <i>What</i> are you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, what?  You're shaving?  Isn't that underwear?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=impressed,Oh, it really <i>is</i> the dress.  Well, it's good you're finally following the rules, at least.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased,Considering how my suit is all one piece, I suppose dramatic full-body reveals is just the Mejarian way.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored,I'm not sure whether to be happy you're taking off something substantial for once or disappointed that you're losing...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored,It's true.  When it comes to sexuality, you never disappoint...wish I could say that about your flying.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Again</i>?  At least you can only expose yourself so many times.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=angry,What is the <i>matter</i> with you?  You're talking like you're not human!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,I'll never understand people who <i>want</i> to be seen naked.  Even Jura draws out the process.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I should have figured you'd be just as obscene as last time.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,What about...your mask?  I guess you wouldn't be recognized as your public self without it...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,Your--breasts?  Already?  Don't you have the mask still?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=addressing,Wha--are you sure?  The leotard already?  ...Well, I won't stop you...it's not my fault when the enemy makes mistakes.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=disappointed,It isn't fun to beat an opponent who makes mistakes.  You still have your mask.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=disappointed,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Is nudity even on your radar?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Aren't you getting tired of this?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Naked already?  That's a little sad, ~name~.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Did you play this game just to strip?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=unimpressed,Owning your sexuality is one thing...but you're a little <i>too</i> eager.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=bored,I wanted a challenge tonight...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,totalRounds:0-10=disappointed,Already?  Well, let's see them.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,...I didn't know adult women could be that small.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Wow.  No one is that small on Mejare...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=confused,Is this natural genetics at work?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,That's a little sad...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,You've got a chest rivaling Hibiki's.  You know, a man.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=impressed,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You didn't know the die could do that?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Mine may be covered, but you can probably still compare...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Close to mine, maybe?  Maybe not...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=impressed,Are you happy with them, ~name~?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,Looks like what Duero's book had for "woman."
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Nothing special.  Like me.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=impressed,...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Jura, I'm sorry if I've ever called you flirtatious.  This girl puts you to shame.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.  Speaking of which, Jura, want to tell her the classics?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,M-magic?  What are you--
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=surprised-horny,That's--my God.  You <i>are</i> a fairy.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,Magic?  You really <i>are</i> a fairy...though based on how you treat men, not the ones I read about as a girl.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shocked,I--you--that's incredible!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=addressing,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,This really is surprising.  Maybe I should have figured someone would try to shake us by doing this...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Perhaps this is the best way to play...expose yourself early to avoid embarrassment later.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=disappointed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...You must be very proud.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Woo.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Back to the game, people.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Isn't that bad for your back?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Your vanity could go toe-to-toe with Jura's.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=stressed,...You must be very proud.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Woo.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Back to the game, people.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Isn't that bad for your back?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Jura and you in the same room is drowning us all in vanity...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm not stopping.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  We're going to continue.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=awkward,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,I'm not stopping just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=pleased,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep playing.  You should have been more careful.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,At least with the leotard I can understand needing help.  Especially considering the...<i>size</i> of your backside.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...a lot to handle.  And you developed all that muscle?  I've got a lot of respect for you...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,Oh, your...backside.  It's a lot...but in a good way.  I can tell you worked hard to give it that volume...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,All that muscle...Mejare hardly pays attention to the butt, but I like how a dedicated woman can improve hers.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=impressed,...You're a cat.  Not dressed as one, but...a cat.  Earth is something else...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Your breasts out already...and you say you're some kind of cat-woman hybrid?  <i>Earth</i>...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=annoyed,Is <i>this</i> what Earth's been doing with its stolen organs?  Generating mutant catwomen?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:mejare_few_animals=surprised-horny,Mejare has cats in zoos...but almost no animals at all.  Too see a cat, and one combined with a woman...it's unreal.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,At least you spoiled the surprise ahead of time.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=bored,...Why exactly are you ashamed of that?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,How deceiving.  Congratulations.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=stressed,...Your modesty is flattering.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...As expected.  I've known you for too long.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,See?  Hardly anything, but enough to to play with...for your viewing pleasure.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,Sometimes I hate being right.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,At least she's wearing underwear.  <i>That</i> I didn't take as a given.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,Quite the flourish.  You've been waiting all night to do that, haven't you?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,I don't think we'll ever see eye-to-eye on these matters, but you certainly have style.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=addressing,If this bodysuit comes off, don't expect me to do it with the same kind of flair.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=addressing,Well, Jura, you sure made it count.  Nothing makes you happier than showing off your breasts, does it?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Going all the way?  Should have played your cards better.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,I wonder how a Tarakkian would react to seeing this...pure terror, most likely.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=bored,No different than our changing stations...of course, I'm always wearing my suit.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Nudity doesn't bother a Mejarian.  Not around other women, anyway.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,It's just a little nudity, ~name~.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,A...<i>selfie</i>?  Oh...well, just leave me out of it, clothes or not.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,If that means what I think it does, all that I ask is that I'm not in the background.  Have fun being nude together.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,What's a "selfie"?  Is it--oh.  I see...and I want nothing to do with it, even if I'm still mostly dressed.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,I'm going to ask you don't include <i>me</i> this time.  I'd rather not be in a photo where Jura's embarrassing herself.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=confused,What do you mean?  You're out of clothes...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored,Oh, dear.  <i>Now</i> what do you have planned?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=disappointed,...This doesn't bode well.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=unimpressed,Always have a backup plan, don't you?  Not for flying, but for this.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=thinking,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,A...<i>selfie</i>?  Oh...well, just leave me out of it, clothes or not.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=unimpressed,If that means what I think it does, all that I ask is that I'm not in the background.  Have fun being nude together.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,What's a "selfie"?  Is it--oh.  I see...and I want nothing to do with it, even if I'm still mostly dressed.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,I'm going to ask you don't include <i>me</i> this time.  I'd rather not be in a photo where Jura's embarrassing herself.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=impressed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=awkward,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,Why did you come here with nothing on?  You're so carefree...do you just like being seen?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,For a strange hybrid woman, you seem quite at peace with yourself...showing up naked.  That's admirable...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Was this game just an excuse to shave yourself?  You're so positive about it, I can't even be annoyed.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,It's irritating enough to strip naked...to <i>arrive</i> naked and perform personal hygiene here shows a lot of self-confidence.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Maybe I could learn from how at peace you are with your body...just arriving naked and smiling the entire time.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Next to girls like this, Jura, you're the picture of chastity.  At least you've limited yourself to women thus far.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,...Did you not expect that to happen?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=addressing,I hope you're not ashamed of that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=calm,I suppose you wouldn't have come here if you were ashamed of your body.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I wonder if I'll have to do this...no.  Can't start doubting myself.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=calm,Not really any sizes to compare...I heard men have to.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=addressing,See, that wasn't so hard.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,So now you're even more naked than before...well, I support the move.  Mejare values cleanliness on the body.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Mejare treats body hair like a plague to be eradicated...so you've given me mixed feelings.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=bored,Now you'd fit right in on Mejare.  Had you come there looking how you did before, they'd have forcibly shaved you.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,On my home planet, women value shaving to an extreme...the goal is to look as sleek as possible.  You certainly fit the bill now.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Jura always <i>did</i> want to be a model.  You have no idea how much this means to her.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,Come anywhere near me with that webbing and the Nirvana will be paying your planet a visit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,And after all that, you look perfectly fine.  What was the issue with this?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=bored,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=unimpressed,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,Jura always <i>did</i> want to be a model.  You have no idea how much this means to her.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,...I see.  I wouldn't live my life based on what men want, though.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=awkward,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...I was more concerned with the cards.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,<i>Now</i> what are you doing?  Attacking us for losing?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=awkward,What did you expect?  ...Not sure what I did.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing,Even the die is getting sick of this.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=smug,If this doesn't prove the existence of fate, I don't know what does.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I've always thought shaved looks better...more functional, too.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=addressing,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=bored,Ah.  I see.  Well, that's not the kind of luxury <i>I'll</i> have.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,My hair is very much out of the way already, though I suppose that ruins the tease.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=interested,Using your body as another item?  Surprisingly resourceful, Jura.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,I guess even <i>you</i> are above counting that separately.


#lost bodysuit
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Ah, and the shirt comes off.  What do men hide underneath it, besides their pride?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Standing here in my underwear <i>does</i> make this more titillating.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Anytime you're ready, ~name~.  This is what I came to see, even if I'd never admit it.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Let me see what you've got.  Not many men in my life for you to compete with.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I take the lead.  Show me what I've earned.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nintendo?  ...<i>Character</i>?  What are you on about?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nint--<i>what</i>?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,Breaking character?  Are you some kind of street performer?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,You don't look all that muscular.  Neither is Hibiki, but he's got more of a spine.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, though he'd reach it a lot quicker.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  They're ruthlessly efficient, just like Tarakkians themselves.
3-male_chest_is_visible=confused,Why do men have nipples, anyway?
3-male_chest_is_visible=impressed,Nipples, huh?  You don't seem the type to nurse your young...
3-male_chest_is_visible=addressing,You're in good shape...for a man.
3-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,It's like someone shaved an ape...
3-male_chest_is_visible=horny,Oh, are you into exercise too?
3-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,Dita and Misty fought over Hibiki...if he looked like <i>you</i>, maybe I'd understand.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...maybe I was mistaken.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  I don't see the point of them on a man...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I know why <i>women</i> have nipples...but I could never picture a man nursing his young.  So you don't have any?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,Can't say I'm not curious about that ungainly-looking bulge.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I wonder what you've been hiding...and why you've been hiding it.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Come on, ~name~, let's see what you men like to keep under wraps.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Looks like it already wants to get free.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,You're blushing, ~name~.  I didn't know men could be so sensitive.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Don't be so dramatic about it.  I've seen pictures in Duero's textbook.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=unimpressed,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,I hope you're an anomaly among men...
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Do women still appreciate that size?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I guess you don't have control over something like that...
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I'm feeling a strange kinship with you.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=confused,Are they <i>usually</i> that small?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,If they're <i>all</i> that small, I can see why women formed their own planet.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Looks about right, but I wonder what it's like in action...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I wonder if B.C. still has hers...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Mmm...feels like the Paksis flooding my mind.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=pleased,That thing must be dear to men.  It <i>is</i> where Hibiki marked his Vanguard...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,It looks strange...but there's something about it I can't ignore.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...<i>Visual</i> curiosity.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=pleased,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I'd hoped to see this, but to actually be staring at it...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,Finally looking at one...I'm not sure how to react.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Are they all the same size?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=smug,Hey, size isn't everything.  Just look at Hibiki.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny,Oh...I want to see how that thing works.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Just going to stand there swinging it around?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Impressive size...but I like people who know how to <i>use</i> their gifts, not just show them off.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=interested,Form isn't everything.  Do you have the function to match?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Baring it all...glad I'm not the first.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=disappointed,That could have been me, so my heart goes out to you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smug,If this were life-or-death, I might have taken this for you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm,Pretend you're in a spa.  Earth has women's spas, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=stretching,Stretching yourself out can be relaxing under pressure...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=disappointed,I can't believe you were watching me strip with any interest.  Haven't the showers made my body mundane to you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored,There's no need for you to compare yourself to me.  I already know you think you're superior.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=unimpressed,Oh, just get it over with.  I'm sure you've practiced this more than you have your strategy.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=disappointed,If there's any woman I know who can strip with flourish and grace, it's you, Jura.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,What about...your mask?  I guess you wouldn't be recognized as your public self without it...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,Your--breasts?  Already?  Don't you have the mask still?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=addressing,Wha--are you sure?  The leotard already?  ...Well, I won't stop you...it's not my fault when the enemy makes mistakes.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=disappointed,It isn't fun to beat an opponent who makes mistakes.  You still have your mask.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Is nudity even on your radar?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Aren't you getting tired of this?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=disappointed,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,What are you going on about now?  What are you going to do?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=confused,...Wait, what did you just say you could do?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,...I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...What do you mean that's <i>fur</i>?  You're not serious?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You're--<i>shaving</i>?  As in, it's fur?  But how?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,That's your <i>pubic</i> hair?  Who are you?  <i>What</i> are you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, what?  You're shaving?  Isn't that underwear?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Again</i>?  At least you can only expose yourself so many times.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=angry,What is the <i>matter</i> with you?  You're talking like you're not human!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,I'll never understand people who <i>want</i> to be seen naked.  Even Jura draws out the process.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I should have figured you'd be just as obscene as last time.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You can ask Jura where all the rum on our ship goes.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Oh...they're cute!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Well, don't beat yourself up about it, ~name~.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,Don't be ashamed of what you can't control...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Too much time in the spa?  Jura says I just sweat them away.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,You're like a child...you're not a child, right?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,Oh...they're cute!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Well, don't beat yourself up about it, ~name~.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Don't be ashamed of what you can't control...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,What do you think, Jura?  Is <i>she</i> just sweating them away, too?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,You're like a child...you're not a child, right?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=impressed,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You didn't know the die could do that?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:oma_and_fama=interested,Nice size.  You'd make a good Fama.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,I wonder if I could get mine that big...somehow.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=impressed,Makes me a little thirsty, honestly.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,marker:oma_and_fama=thinking,Is it possible to make breasts grow?  I wish mine were big enough to be a Fama...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=thinking,Ezra's have been getting bigger, always feeding Kahlua...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,This really is surprising.  Maybe I should have figured someone would try to shake us by doing this...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Perhaps this is the best way to play...expose yourself early to avoid embarrassment later.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=addressing,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=disappointed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.  Speaking of which, Jura, want to tell her the classics?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Jura, I'm sorry if I've ever called you flirtatious.  This girl puts you to shame.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,M-magic?  What are you--
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=surprised-horny,That's--my God.  You <i>are</i> a fairy.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,Magic?  You really <i>are</i> a fairy...though based on how you treat men, not the ones I read about as a girl.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shocked,I--you--that's incredible!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,...Ugh...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...Fleshy.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Tch...don't let them get in your way.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Somehow I feel like I've still lost this round.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking,Almost everyone on Mejare is well-endowed...and for some rather unsavory reasons.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,At least with the leotard I can understand needing help.  Especially considering the...<i>size</i> of your backside.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...a lot to handle.  And you developed all that muscle?  I've got a lot of respect for you...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,Oh, your...backside.  It's a lot...but in a good way.  I can tell you worked hard to give it that volume...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,All that muscle...Mejare hardly pays attention to the butt, but I like how a dedicated woman can improve hers.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...As expected.  I've known you for too long.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,See?  Hardly anything, but enough to to play with...for your viewing pleasure.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,Sometimes I hate being right.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,At least she's wearing underwear.  <i>That</i> I didn't take as a given.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=thinking,Sorry to say, but I don't think I'll be living up to that reveal.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=disappointed,Jura's breasts are shapely, as you can see.  So if you're curious what Mejarians strive for, there it is.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=thinking,Even with my bra on, you can see I don't quite measure up...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=thinking,Well, there it is.  I hope everyone enjoys the best Mejare has to offer.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=impressed,...You're a cat.  Not dressed as one, but...a cat.  Earth is something else...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Your breasts out already...and you say you're some kind of cat-woman hybrid?  <i>Earth</i>...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=annoyed,Is <i>this</i> what Earth's been doing with its stolen organs?  Generating mutant catwomen?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:mejare_few_animals=surprised-horny,Mejare has cats in zoos...but almost no animals at all.  Too see a cat, and one combined with a woman...it's unreal.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,At least you spoiled the surprise ahead of time.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=bored,...Why exactly are you ashamed of that?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,How deceiving.  Congratulations.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=stressed,...Your modesty is flattering.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm not stopping.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  We're going to continue.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=awkward,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,I'm not stopping just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=pleased,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep playing.  You should have been more careful.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,At your limit, ~name~?  Don't let me do this without fighting back.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Just going to let me win like this?  I like women with some fight in them.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Oh, relax.  You're not beaten yet.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Christmas is coming early.  Did you know Tarak doesn't have Christmas?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=disappointed,Mine isn't that far off from being visible...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=thinking,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=impressed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=awkward,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,A...<i>selfie</i>?  Oh...well, just leave me out of it, clothes or not.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=unimpressed,If that means what I think it does, all that I ask is that I'm not in the background.  Have fun being nude together.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,What's a "selfie"?  Is it--oh.  I see...and I want nothing to do with it, even if I'm still mostly dressed.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,I'm going to ask you don't include <i>me</i> this time.  I'd rather not be in a photo where Jura's embarrassing herself.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased,Not quite as exciting for you as the breast reveal, I imagine.  A groin is a groin.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased,You probably don't find this quite as stimulating.  There's really only one size for this...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=addressing,You look like you were having more fun with the dress coming off.  Now it's just a formality.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased,I hope no one was expecting anything exotic.  Mejarians are just women, like anyone else.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,Why did you come here with nothing on?  You're so carefree...do you just like being seen?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,For a strange hybrid woman, you seem quite at peace with yourself...showing up naked.  That's admirable...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Was this game just an excuse to shave yourself?  You're so positive about it, I can't even be annoyed.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,It's irritating enough to strip naked...to <i>arrive</i> naked and perform personal hygiene here shows a lot of self-confidence.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Maybe I could learn from how at peace you are with your body...just arriving naked and smiling the entire time.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,A...<i>selfie</i>?  Oh...well, just leave me out of it, clothes or not.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,If that means what I think it does, all that I ask is that I'm not in the background.  Have fun being nude together.

3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Next to girls like this, Jura, you're the picture of chastity.  At least you've limited yourself to women thus far.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,...Did you not expect that to happen?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
3-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,I guess living around men doesn't ruin it or anything...
3-female_crotch_is_visible=calm,Taking care of yourself, then?  Jura just coasts on natural beauty.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,I didn't expect much different.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=thinking,A woman's groin is nothing special...unless you're an Earthling.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=happy,You can still win, ~name~.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I guess living around men doesn't ruin it or anything...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,This Earth woman takes better care of herself than you, Jura.  You're too reliant on your natural beauty...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I didn't expect much different.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,A woman's groin is nothing special...unless you're an Earthling.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=happy,You can still win, ~name~.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I've always thought shaved looks better...more functional, too.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=awkward,What did you expect?  ...Not sure what I did.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing,Even the die is getting sick of this.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=smug,If this doesn't prove the existence of fate, I don't know what does.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=addressing,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=disappointed,I'd rather not trip over my hair and get it in my eyes.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=addressing,I am for practicality above all...you know that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=addressing,If I had my way, you and Dita would forcibly have your hair cut to the jawline.  It's nothing but a distraction.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=bored,I'll take practicality in a firefight over keeping strangers interested in my nude body.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Jura always <i>did</i> want to be a model.  You have no idea how much this means to her.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,You certainly own your body, Jura.  Soon all of Earth will appreciate it.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Your media takeover of Earth is well underway, Jura.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,Jura always <i>did</i> want to be a model.  You have no idea how much this means to her.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Perhaps it's just a picture to you, Mahiru, but to Jura, it's the start of her media conquest.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,And after all that, you look perfectly fine.  What was the issue with this?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=bored,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=unimpressed,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,Come anywhere near me with that webbing and the Nirvana will be paying your planet a visit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,...I see.  I wouldn't live my life based on what men want, though.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=awkward,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...I was more concerned with the cards.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,<i>Now</i> what are you doing?  Attacking us for losing?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,So now you're even more naked than before...well, I support the move.  Mejare values cleanliness on the body.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Mejare treats body hair like a plague to be eradicated...so you've given me mixed feelings.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=bored,Now you'd fit right in on Mejare.  Had you come there looking how you did before, they'd have forcibly shaved you.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,On my home planet, women value shaving to an extreme...the goal is to look as sleek as possible.  You certainly fit the bill now.

4-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,At least you grew up around the opposite sex.  I've exposed myself without that benefit.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,I've heard men aren't as averse to showing off their chests...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,I've heard men don't care about exposing their bodies.  Is that right, ~name~?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,You'll get used to an exposed chest, I promise.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Come now, I've shown you my chest...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nintendo?  ...<i>Character</i>?  What are you on about?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,...Nint--<i>what</i>?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=confused,Breaking character?  Are you some kind of street performer?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,You don't look all that muscular.  Neither is Hibiki, but he's got more of a spine.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, though he'd reach it a lot quicker.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  They're ruthlessly efficient, just like Tarakkians themselves.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
4-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,You're built like Duero...or perhaps Bart, if he had the discipline.
4-male_chest_is_visible=pleased,Hibiki needs to bulk up.  Doesn't being short help with that?
4-male_chest_is_visible=interested,From what I understand of male bodies...yours is a good one.
4-male_chest_is_visible=addressing,Want to spar sometime?  I've been in streetfights, you know.
4-male_chest_is_visible=interested,Not as sightly as a woman's, but it <i>does</i> look practical.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...maybe I was mistaken.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  I don't see the point of them on a man...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I know why <i>women</i> have nipples...but I could never picture a man nursing his young.  So you don't have any?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,Ooh.  I ought to learn something from this.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=impressed,The men swear those things have minds of their own...perhaps they're right.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Looks like it's already breaking free.  Who's responsible for that?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Come on.  Men aren't supposed to be shy.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,You're just standing there...so is your thing, for that matter.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=unimpressed,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,So do men experience size envy, or are you all good-natured about it?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,That doesn't look too useful.  Can it still get a woman pregnant?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Now I feel a little bad about egging you on...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,Don't feel bad.  My Dread is small and manuverable...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,<i>That</i> explains your reluctance.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Pretty good.  But can't it get bigger?  Something about blood flow?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Is that as big as it gets?  I'm curious...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Looks eager...I'm feeling that way myself.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=impressed,When they called it a tube, I wasn't expecting a cap on the end.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,That thing looks like it was made from spare parts...but I <i>do</i> kind of like it.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=pleased,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Close encounters, as they say...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed,Finally seeing one...didn't think I'd do it with my breasts out.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I've always tried not to look when Bart's piloting the ship...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I'm still not quite sure what to make of men...this just complicates things.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...<i>Visual</i> curiosity.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,I--I, uh...uh...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Do you have enough blood for that thing?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,There's no way that thing would fit...in <i>any</i> woman.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny,Oh, wow.  Coming here <i>was</i> a good idea.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I guess you wouldn't relate to size anxiety...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,You should know that this won't satisfy me.  I'm winning this game.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Mejare is nothing but women.  I've seen breasts before, I promise.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,Come on, ~name~.  You can see mine...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,No woman who serves under me would back down from a challenge.  I wouldn't let them.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You can ask Jura where all the rum on our ship goes.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...What do you mean that's <i>fur</i>?  You're not serious?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You're--<i>shaving</i>?  As in, it's fur?  But how?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,That's your <i>pubic</i> hair?  Who are you?  <i>What</i> are you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, what?  You're shaving?  Isn't that underwear?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,What are you going on about now?  What are you going to do?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=confused,...Wait, what did you just say you could do?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,...I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=stressed,Wha--you--<i>you wouldn't</i>!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=angry,Barnette?  S-she wouldn't agree to that!  She gets jealous just from women staring at you on the ship!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=stressed,<i>Filming</i>?  You're trying to <i>blackmail</i> me?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=stressed,Wha--you wouldn't tell people I came here?  I did you a favor, Jura!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Is nudity even on your radar?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Aren't you getting tired of this?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Again</i>?  At least you can only expose yourself so many times.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=angry,What is the <i>matter</i> with you?  You're talking like you're not human!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,I'll never understand people who <i>want</i> to be seen naked.  Even Jura draws out the process.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I should have figured you'd be just as obscene as last time.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,What about...your mask?  I guess you wouldn't be recognized as your public self without it...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,Your--breasts?  Already?  Don't you have the mask still?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=addressing,Wha--are you sure?  The leotard already?  ...Well, I won't stop you...it's not my fault when the enemy makes mistakes.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=disappointed,It isn't fun to beat an opponent who makes mistakes.  You still have your mask.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=disappointed,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Cute little things...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,Every woman on Mejare is genetically engineered to some extent...perhaps you could have used some.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,It's alright.  Flaws are what make us human.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,Yours look like Misty's...I guess she's all-natural, too.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,No wealthy Mejarian couple would have a child that small without changes being made.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=impressed,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You didn't know the die could do that?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,Mmm, they're nice, ~name~.  Do you get massages?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,We look pretty comparable.  In poker skills, too, apparently.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,Reminds me of our crew's spa breaks...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,This shouldn't be so exciting...I need a cooler head.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Better than mine, maybe, but a woman's worth is in her brain.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=addressing,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.  Speaking of which, Jura, want to tell her the classics?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,M-magic?  What are you--
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=surprised-horny,That's--my God.  You <i>are</i> a fairy.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,Magic?  You really <i>are</i> a fairy...though based on how you treat men, not the ones I read about as a girl.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shocked,I--you--that's incredible!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=disappointed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,This really is surprising.  Maybe I should have figured someone would try to shake us by doing this...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Perhaps this is the best way to play...expose yourself early to avoid embarrassment later.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Jura, I'm sorry if I've ever called you flirtatious.  This girl puts you to shame.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...................
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Ahem.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking,No secrets left, I suppose...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,<i>Humiliating</i>...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=angry,Yes, yes, we get it.  Move on.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking,We're all small next to the universe...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,At least you spoiled the surprise ahead of time.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=bored,...Why exactly are you ashamed of that?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,How deceiving.  Congratulations.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=stressed,...Your modesty is flattering.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=impressed,...You're a cat.  Not dressed as one, but...a cat.  Earth is something else...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Your breasts out already...and you say you're some kind of cat-woman hybrid?  <i>Earth</i>...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=annoyed,Is <i>this</i> what Earth's been doing with its stolen organs?  Generating mutant catwomen?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:mejare_few_animals=surprised-horny,Mejare has cats in zoos...but almost no animals at all.  Too see a cat, and one combined with a woman...it's unreal.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...As expected.  I've known you for too long.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,See?  Hardly anything, but enough to to play with...for your viewing pleasure.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,Sometimes I hate being right.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,At least she's wearing underwear.  <i>That</i> I didn't take as a given.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,At least with the leotard I can understand needing help.  Especially considering the...<i>size</i> of your backside.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...a lot to handle.  And you developed all that muscle?  I've got a lot of respect for you...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,Oh, your...backside.  It's a lot...but in a good way.  I can tell you worked hard to give it that volume...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,All that muscle...Mejare hardly pays attention to the butt, but I like how a dedicated woman can improve hers.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm not stopping.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  We're going to continue.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=awkward,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,I'm not stopping just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=pleased,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep playing.  You should have been more careful.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=bored,...Let's move on.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=bored,...You know, Jura, trust is important among crewmates.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=bored,...You're hilarious, Jura.  And I'm an idiot.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=annoyed,...You know, I have a reputation to uphold.  People <i>expect</i> you to be publicly stripping.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Beaten to the punch, and what a relief...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,You pushed me pretty far, but not quite far enough.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Shaking you off was a pain.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I wasn't about to be shot down first.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased,On a planet full of women, you <i>do</i> tend to run into a few of these.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=thinking,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,What does that--wait, like a <i>picture</i>?  ...I'd appreciate if you omitted my own nudity.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,I'm not exactly covered myself, so kindly leave me out of the picture this time...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,I ask that you omit me from <i>this</i> picture, given my...nudity.  And leadership.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,<i>Jura</i> may want naked photos of herself circulating on foreign planets, but <i>I</i> have a reputation...so leave me out.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=impressed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=awkward,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,I wonder how men react to this...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,I wonder how a man would react to this.  A man from Earth, I mean.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,How do Earth women feel about this sort of thing?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,Well, we all have the same body parts...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,None of you would want a man around for this...right?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Next to girls like this, Jura, you're the picture of chastity.  At least you've limited yourself to women thus far.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased,I'm not without style.  These shorts match my hair...and so did the bra.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=addressing,My shorts are the same color as my hair.  Does that count for nothing at all?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=addressing,I know what good fashion looks like...I just don't care.  Underwear that matches my hair is enough for me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased,It's not as if there's not a personal touch here.  They're the same shade as my hair.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,What does that--wait, like a <i>picture</i>?  ...I'd appreciate if you omitted my own nudity.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,I'm not exactly covered myself, so kindly leave me out of the picture this time...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,I ask that you omit me from <i>this</i> picture, given my...nudity.  And leadership.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,<i>Jura</i> may want naked photos of herself circulating on foreign planets, but <i>I</i> have a reputation...so leave me out.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,...Did you not expect that to happen?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,Why did you come here with nothing on?  You're so carefree...do you just like being seen?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,For a strange hybrid woman, you seem quite at peace with yourself...showing up naked.  That's admirable...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Was this game just an excuse to shave yourself?  You're so positive about it, I can't even be annoyed.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,It's irritating enough to strip naked...to <i>arrive</i> naked and perform personal hygiene here shows a lot of self-confidence.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Maybe I could learn from how at peace you are with your body...just arriving naked and smiling the entire time.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=smug,You can probably see the outline of mine anyway.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Supple.  Might actually make Jura a little jealous.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Now you're dressed like Barnette really wants to be.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=addressing,You could still mount a comeback on me no problem.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,I'm wet already...it's distracting.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=horny,You have to understand...I was raised to love women.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,You can probably see the outline of mine anyway.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Supple.  Sure you're not jealous, Jura?  Can <i>anything</i> make you jealous?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Now you're dressed like Barnette really wants to be.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You could still mount a comeback on me no problem.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I'm wet already...it's distracting.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,So now you're even more naked than before...well, I support the move.  Mejare values cleanliness on the body.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Mejare treats body hair like a plague to be eradicated...so you've given me mixed feelings.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=bored,Now you'd fit right in on Mejare.  Had you come there looking how you did before, they'd have forcibly shaved you.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,On my home planet, women value shaving to an extreme...the goal is to look as sleek as possible.  You certainly fit the bill now.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,At least you're having fun, Jura.  I don't know why you thought I'd like this...or that I'd want nude photos taken.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Take all the photos you want, Jura.  This was your idea...and if they don't include <i>my</i> body, I don't see the issue.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Perhaps I should keep one of those photos, Jura...and show it to Barnette the next time you ignore my orders.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,I've never considered myself photogenic...not that I'd want any <i>nude</i> photos.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,At least you're having fun, Jura.  I don't know why you thought I'd like this...or that I'd want nude photos taken.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=pleased,Take all the photos you want, Jura.  This was your idea...and if they don't include <i>my</i> body, I don't see the issue.

4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,I've never considered myself photogenic...not that I'd want any <i>nude</i> photos.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,<i>Now</i> what are you doing?  Attacking us for losing?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=addressing,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,...I see.  I wouldn't live my life based on what men want, though.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=awkward,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...I was more concerned with the cards.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,And after all that, you look perfectly fine.  What was the issue with this?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=bored,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=unimpressed,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,Come anywhere near me with that webbing and the Nirvana will be paying your planet a visit.

4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,You can have your fun with your hair...though I'd prefer you cut it short for combat.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=interested,You really had this whole thing planned out.  I wish you brought this much enthusiasm to your Dread.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=addressing,Be as fanciful as you want.  I'm winning now, so <i>I'm</i> satisfied.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,Not content to flaunt the size of your breasts, you want to make sure everyone gets a full view...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=awkward,What did you expect?  ...Not sure what I did.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing,Even the die is getting sick of this.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=smug,If this doesn't prove the existence of fate, I don't know what does.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,You don't look all that muscular.  Neither is Hibiki, but he's got more of a spine.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, though he'd reach it a lot quicker.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  They're ruthlessly efficient, just like Tarakkians themselves.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
-3-male_chest_is_visible=interested,You're in good shape...I like that.

-3-male_chest_is_visible=horny,Seeing a man like this is so strange...all my instincts flare up at once.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...maybe I was mistaken.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  I don't see the point of them on a man...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I know why <i>women</i> have nipples...but I could never picture a man nursing his young.  So you don't have any?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=awkward,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=impressed,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,I thought you said you were a man!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=confused,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed,For a man...you look very feminine.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=disappointed,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,I've showed you mine...now you show me yours.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,A man doesn't lose his nerve, right?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Jura's always talking about having a baby with a man...I wonder if she's got the right idea.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,You know, Tarakkians believe women eat men's organs...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Give me something to brag about seeing...if I were the bragging type.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=unimpressed,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I've showed you mine...now you show me yours.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,A man doesn't lose his nerve, right?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Well, Jura, here's the moment of truth.  Still sure about having a baby with a man?  I'm not exactly sold on the idea.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You know, Tarakkians believe women eat men's organs...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Give me something to brag about seeing...if I were the bragging type.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,That brings things down a little...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Reminds of me of Hibiki...his whole body, I mean.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=pleased,It's OK.  The Nirvana has room for small fries...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,Don't feel bad.  Flaws are what make people interesting...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed,...So where is it?  I wanted to see one.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Standing here like this, seeing your thing...I can't explain the feeling.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=unimpressed,Men and women, naked together.  We're practically mating already.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,Are you really supposed to just...<i>insert</i> that thing?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny,Standing at attention, like any good pilot.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Not bad at all, ~name~.  Maybe I'll give men a shot...if I ever get desperate enough.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=impressed,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=disappointed,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...<i>Visual</i> curiosity.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,Tonight's been quite a night...seeing a man like this.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,A nude man.  I can hardly take this...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=surprised-horny,I really didn't think I'd be naked when I finally saw one...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=happy,I'm still not sure what to make of men...but you don't seem so bad.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny,What a pleasant surprise.  I thought it would smell...or sting.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=pleased,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=impressed,Oh my.  That's about the size of Hibiki's entire body...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=addressing,Sure you can handle that thing?  Men have never struck me as good with tools.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Ooh.  They called it a tube, not a pipe.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny,My head feels hot...and it's all your fault.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=surprised-horny,I don't think I could handle that...especially without practice.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=annoyed,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=surprised-horny,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised-horny,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Join the club, ~name~.  I'm deeper in it than <i>that</i>.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing,You'll live...and it'll liven things.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,I <i>do</i> want to see, in spite of myself...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Strip poker would make the Nirvana very awkward...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Isn't this what we all really wanted, playing this game?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...What do you mean that's <i>fur</i>?  You're not serious?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You're--<i>shaving</i>?  As in, it's fur?  But how?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shocked,That's your <i>pubic</i> hair?  Who are you?  <i>What</i> are you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=surprised-horny,...I'm sorry, what?  You're shaving?  Isn't that underwear?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,What are you going on about now?  What are you going to do?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=confused,...Wait, what did you just say you could do?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=disappointed,...I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=disappointed,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,Join the club, ~name~.  I'm deeper in it than <i>that</i>.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You'll live...and it'll liven things.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=interested,I <i>do</i> want to see, in spite of myself...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Strip poker would make the Nirvana very awkward...good thing it's just the two of us, Jura.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Isn't this what we all really wanted, playing this game?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,<i>Again</i>?  At least you can only expose yourself so many times.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=angry,What is the <i>matter</i> with you?  You're talking like you're not human!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=bored,I'll never understand people who <i>want</i> to be seen naked.  Even Jura draws out the process.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=unimpressed,Here we go again.  I should have figured you'd be just as obscene as last time.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=angry,Wha--<i>no, you didn't!</i>  I refuse to believe that!  She's just a child!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=stressed,<i>Paiway?</i>  Jura, she's a child!  She can't be here!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=surprised-horny,Paiway?  H-her camera?  How--you--I--
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=surprised-horny,P-<i>Paiway</i>?  I--you're not <i>serious</i>?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Is nudity even on your radar?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed,Aren't you getting tired of this?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:riches_to_rags=thinking,I don't drink because...I had a problem once.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Yes.  You're very clever.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You can ask Jura where all the rum on our ship goes.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,What about...your mask?  I guess you wouldn't be recognized as your public self without it...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,Your--breasts?  Already?  Don't you have the mask still?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=addressing,Wha--are you sure?  The leotard already?  ...Well, I won't stop you...it's not my fault when the enemy makes mistakes.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=disappointed,It isn't fun to beat an opponent who makes mistakes.  You still have your mask.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You really need a hobby.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=bored,Well, at least I've got <i>somebody</i> beat.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,I'm losing, but at least my breasts are bigger.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Maybe I'm too sensitive about my chest...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased,You're somewhere between Paiway and Misty...but older.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=disappointed,Shame won't take you anywhere, ~name~...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=impressed,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You didn't know the die could do that?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,Standing here like this, seeing your chest...it's awkward, but...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,You look great, ~name~.  I don't give compliments often.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,You should be proud of yourself, ~name~.  Women need their pride.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,I could use a good massage...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny,You shouldn't have kept us waiting...this is nice and familiar.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=disappointed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing,My idea of a fun time is winning a poker game, not drinking and making a fool of myself.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=addressing,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.  Speaking of which, Jura, want to tell her the classics?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,...Jura, I'm sorry if I've ever called you flirtatious.  This girl puts you to shame.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,M-magic?  What are you--
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=surprised-horny,That's--my God.  You <i>are</i> a fairy.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=impressed,Magic?  You really <i>are</i> a fairy...though based on how you treat men, not the ones I read about as a girl.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shocked,I--you--that's incredible!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=thinking,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,You're bringing a whole new depth to this game.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Bare it all immediately to shake everyone up...could be effective.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,This really is surprising.  Maybe I should have figured someone would try to shake us by doing this...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=impressed,Perhaps this is the best way to play...expose yourself early to avoid embarrassment later.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,...Well, I can't deny the appeal.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed,Certainly worth the wait...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,First the humiliation of exposing myself, and now this...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,Don't say anything...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=angry,Oh, just shut up.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=stressed,...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm not stopping.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  We're going to continue.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=awkward,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,I'm not stopping just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=pleased,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep playing.  You should have been more careful.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,At least you spoiled the surprise ahead of time.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=bored,...Why exactly are you ashamed of that?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=unimpressed,How deceiving.  Congratulations.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=stressed,...Your modesty is flattering.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,At least with the leotard I can understand needing help.  Especially considering the...<i>size</i> of your backside.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...a lot to handle.  And you developed all that muscle?  I've got a lot of respect for you...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,Oh, your...backside.  It's a lot...but in a good way.  I can tell you worked hard to give it that volume...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,All that muscle...Mejare hardly pays attention to the butt, but I like how a dedicated woman can improve hers.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=annoyed,...Very funny.  Excuse me for being concerned.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=disappointed,I don't appreciate being lied to, Jura.  I have to take threats seriously.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=bored,...Maybe it's all a game to you, but I'm responsible for my crewmates' safety...and decency.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=bored,Should've known...but it's better to be cautious.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,...As expected.  I've known you for too long.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,See?  Hardly anything, but enough to to play with...for your viewing pleasure.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=unimpressed,Sometimes I hate being right.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,At least she's wearing underwear.  <i>That</i> I didn't take as a given.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=impressed,...You're a cat.  Not dressed as one, but...a cat.  Earth is something else...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Your breasts out already...and you say you're some kind of cat-woman hybrid?  <i>Earth</i>...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=annoyed,Is <i>this</i> what Earth's been doing with its stolen organs?  Generating mutant catwomen?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia,marker:mejare_few_animals=surprised-horny,Mejare has cats in zoos...but almost no animals at all.  Too see a cat, and one combined with a woman...it's unreal.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing,Don't be shy, ~name~...I haven't been.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,I'm a leader...I shouldn't be all worked up like this.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,It <i>is</i> a little exciting...and I don't get excited.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I'm sure it's nothing out of the ordinary.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,You can do it, ~name~.  Didn't you watch me do it?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=disappointed,I thought men liked breasts more.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=bored,Most women would take off their bras first...even me, despite my reservations.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Next to girls like this, Jura, you're the picture of chastity.  At least you've limited yourself to women thus far.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,I thought men liked breasts more...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed,Most women would take off their bras first...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=thinking,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=impressed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=awkward,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry,Just leave already.  You're clearly not interested in the game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Would you stop wasting all of our time?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,...Did you not expect that to happen?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Keep in mind you started with more clothing than I did, Jura.  So on an even playing field, you'd be beaten already.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Congratulations.  Now you're only still in the game because you wore more than I did.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=addressing,Don't get too proud of yourself.  I've been counting...you were wearing more than me, so this was basically decided already.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=addressing,It's a little sad, Jura.  Even with all your accessories, and even wearing more than me to start with, here you are, naked just the same.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,Why did you come here with nothing on?  You're so carefree...do you just like being seen?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,For a strange hybrid woman, you seem quite at peace with yourself...showing up naked.  That's admirable...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Was this game just an excuse to shave yourself?  You're so positive about it, I can't even be annoyed.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,It's irritating enough to strip naked...to <i>arrive</i> naked and perform personal hygiene here shows a lot of self-confidence.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=thinking,Maybe I could learn from how at peace you are with your body...just arriving naked and smiling the entire time.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised-horny,Wha--<i>right away</i>?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I thought <i>I</i> was unfamiliar with Earth women's clothing...apparently you're unfamiliar with your own.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=disappointed,I guess it doesn't matter what we take off first...but suspense would be nice.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=disappointed,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,Don't mind me.  By all means, get yourself killed.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,There's no arguing with someone this stupid.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored,I can understand pulling a dumb stunt and learning from it.  I have no tolerance for those who refuse to do the latter.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=confused,...What's a <i>combo</i>?  ...What's a <i>bug</i>?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,...And this revolutionized things, somehow?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:streetfighter1,notSaidMarker:chi_sf2,marker:chi_sf2=awkward,These things run on computers, right?  If there was a bug, why didn't they fix it?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,What does that--wait, like a <i>picture</i>?  ...I'd appreciate if you omitted my own nudity.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,I'm not exactly covered myself, so kindly leave me out of the picture this time...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,I ask that you omit me from <i>this</i> picture, given my...nudity.  And leadership.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,<i>Jura</i> may want naked photos of herself circulating on foreign planets, but <i>I</i> have a reputation...so leave me out.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=disappointed,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=thinking,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shocked,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=angry,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,What does that--wait, like a <i>picture</i>?  ...I'd appreciate if you omitted my own nudity.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,I'm not exactly covered myself, so kindly leave me out of the picture this time...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,I ask that you omit me from <i>this</i> picture, given my...nudity.  And leadership.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=bored,<i>Jura</i> may want naked photos of herself circulating on foreign planets, but <i>I</i> have a reputation...so leave me out.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=smug,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=awkward,...It's not often I'm in this situation.  Not unless I'm in the spa.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=pleased,Even on Mejare, this is a <i>little</i> strange...just a little.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=horny,Don't mind me...I grew up feeling this way.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,marker:oma_and_fama=awkward,Do you take after your Fama--er, mother?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=awkward,Do men really feel the same way I do about this?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=horny,Perhaps to an Earth woman, this feels weird...but to a Mejarian, there is no other sexuality.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=addressing,I wouldn't dream of doing this to Dita.  She's too sweet...I'm glad you had the tact to ask <i>me</i> instead.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=smug,So you asked me to come here instead of her, is that it?  I'm not sure whether to be flattered or irritated.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=pleased,Don't concern yourself with Dita...she doesn't belong in a place like this.  Then again, it seems I've taken to it in spite of myself.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=smug,So you asked me instead of her to accompany you?  You should have brought Barnette, if anyone...but I guess you figured I tolerate your antics more.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,And after all that, you look perfectly fine.  What was the issue with this?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=bored,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=unimpressed,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised-horny,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry,Come anywhere near me with that webbing and the Nirvana will be paying your planet a visit.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,...I see.  I wouldn't live my life based on what men want, though.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=impressed,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=awkward,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...I was more concerned with the cards.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,So now you're even more naked than before...well, I support the move.  Mejare values cleanliness on the body.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=awkward,Mejare treats body hair like a plague to be eradicated...so you've given me mixed feelings.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=bored,Now you'd fit right in on Mejare.  Had you come there looking how you did before, they'd have forcibly shaved you.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=disappointed,On my home planet, women value shaving to an extreme...the goal is to look as sleek as possible.  You certainly fit the bill now.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=smug,At least you're having fun, Jura.  I don't know why you thought I'd like this...or that I'd want nude photos taken.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,Take all the photos you want, Jura.  This was your idea...and if they don't include <i>my</i> body, I don't see the issue.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=addressing,Perhaps I should keep one of those photos, Jura...and show it to Barnette the next time you ignore my orders.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,I've never considered myself photogenic...not that I'd want any <i>nude</i> photos.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=addressing,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=awkward,What did you expect?  ...Not sure what I did.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing,Even the die is getting sick of this.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=smug,If this doesn't prove the existence of fate, I don't know what does.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,At least you're having fun, Jura.  I don't know why you thought I'd like this...or that I'd want nude photos taken.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=pleased,Take all the photos you want, Jura.  This was your idea...and if they don't include <i>my</i> body, I don't see the issue.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=addressing,Perhaps I should keep one of those photos, Jura...and show it to Barnette the next time you ignore my orders.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=thinking,I've never considered myself photogenic...not that I'd want any <i>nude</i> photos.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=bored,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=disappointed,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=bored,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I've always thought shaved looks better...more functional, too.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,Shaved is more sensible.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=disappointed,I don't see the appeal in pubic hair.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=confused,Pubic hair...must be an Earth thing.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,notSaidMarker:pubic_hair_comments,marker:pubic_hair_comments=calm,I prefer shaved.  Less friction.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,<i>Now</i> what are you doing?  Attacking us for losing?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=angry,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=impressed,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=annoyed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,Take it off...this is too good of an opportunity to waste.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,Everything you take off is a whole new experience...
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Come on...give me something to think about for <i>weeks</i>.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,You <i>must</i> have wanted this deep down.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Can you compete with the men I know?  All three of them?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,You don't look all that muscular.  Shame, because my body seems to enjoy muscles on a man.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=mast-4-pleased,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, and isn't much better as far as muscles go.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  The taste is too much even for me, though.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,You're incredible...is what my instincts say.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,I respect anyone who keeps themselves fit...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,You're a sight to behold...so hold still and let me.  I only get tonight.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Feel like striking a pose?  Hibiki would.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,You'd look good in any formation...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,So much <i>hair</i>...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Maybe men <i>are</i> worth keeping around...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating, but not all that stimulating.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?  I think I prefer normal men.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=mast-3-disappointed,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some disturbing experimentation?  Not sure I want the answer like this.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-disappointed,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-pleased,I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-pleased,For a man...you look very feminine.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=mast-3-pleased,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=mast-2-disappointed,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...Mejarians <i>like</i> nipples, you know.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  Shame...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,So you don't have any nipples?  Mejarians appreciate nipples, as you might imagine...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-4-disappointed,I thought you said you were a man!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-disappointed,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-2-disappointed,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-pleased,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-pleased,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,The chance to see your thing like this...was always in the back of my mind.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,I want to see how my body reacts to this...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,This feels so right...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Never thought I'd be in this situation...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,Jura was right.  This <i>was</i> a good idea.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,The chance to see your thing like this...was always in the back of my mind.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-2-pleased,I want to see how my body reacts to this...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-2-pleased,This feels so right...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Never thought I'd be in this situation...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Maybe you were right, Jura.  This <i>was</i> a good idea...maybe.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,...Oh.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,........................
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-disappointed,Should have left it to my imagination...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-disappointed,Should have known not to rely on a man for anything...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-disappointed,It <i>must</i> get bigger than <i>that</i>!
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-disappointed,If I wanted to date a woman, I have prettier options.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,Your thing...it's doing something to me I can't control.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,No one on the crew can call me uptight after this game...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,It just stands up by itself...<i>fascinating</i>.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You're making my head spin...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,I'm starting to understand what it really means to "combine"...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=mast-4-pleased,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...Don't get any ideas.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I can't believe I'm doing this in front of a man...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,So, that's really what your tube looks like...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Something about this feels right, despite everything.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,I'm just letting my instincts guide me...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,This is a whole new wave of feelings...I can't keep up.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him...but I'd best keep my thoughts away from any men I know.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.  If I can handle <i>this</i>, I don't understand your concern.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=mast-3-pleased,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man...but then, masturbating doesn't suit <i>me</i>.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Looks sort of stupid, just dangling there...but it's turning me on.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,It just hangs there...I was taught it'd shoot out like a bristle.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,<i>That</i> would have broken my composure...and maybe my body, too.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,This is too much stimulus for one night...I need alone time.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,I don't know which size is best, but my body likes this one...
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-4-disappointed,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-2-pleased,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=mast-3-pleased,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=mast-3-disappointed,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=mast-3-pleased,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=mast-3-pleased,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,Help a fellow woman out...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,I'm sure they're nice, ~name~.  Mine aren't any good.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-2-pleased,I can appreciate breasts as well as any woman...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Take me away from it all for a bit...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=mast-3,I can't stop thinking about Misty's...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-4-pleased,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,I don't drink because...well, let's not kill the mood.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Yes.  You're very clever.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,If you want to know where the Nirvana's rum disappears to, the answer is also at this table.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=mast-4-pleased,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,...How stupid do you think I am?  You're lying.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-4-pleased,I don't believe that for a second.  Give me a break, Jura.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-4-pleased,The <i>men?</i>  No way they'd come here...too big of a risk that a nude woman would pounce and eat them.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,I sincerely doubt that.  Hibiki and Bart would be audible from across the building.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,You really need a hobby.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=mast-4-disappointed,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-3-disappointed,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-3-disappointed,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-3-disappointed,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-3-disappointed,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=mast-3-disappointed,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=mast-3-disappointed,I don't drink because...well, let's not kill the mood.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,Yes.  You're very clever.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,Is nudity even on your radar?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,Aren't you getting tired of this?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You're still gorgeous, ~name~...breasts aren't what define a woman.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-2,Like Misty's...agh, I shouldn't be thinking like that.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You have the heart of a good Fama, if not the chest.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,You're still cute.  You're not embarrassed, are you?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=mast-3-disappointed,Best to just accept your flaws...I'm still working on that.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-pleased,You didn't know the die could do that?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-pleased,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,It's so nice to see an unfamiliar woman...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,~name~...massage them a little.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,Well, don't just stand there.  Move around.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-2-pleased,Ah...<i>this</i> is what I needed.  A woman.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,I wonder where you'd rank on our crew...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-2-disappointed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,I'm sorry I called you flirtatious, Jura...this girl is awful.  But then, I suppose masturbating like this makes me no better.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=mast-4-pleased,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,I'm masturbating, aren't I?  That's always fun.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-3-disappointed,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,You and Jura can surely think of new ways to call me boring.  Though public masturbation is hardly boring, no?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,I'm masturbating, aren't I?  That's always fun.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-3-disappointed,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-3-disappointed,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-4-disappointed,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-3-disappointed,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,Ugghhh...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,I'm not above a little humiliation...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,...................................
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,I can't run from this...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=mast-2-disappointed,...Well.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm not stopping.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  I'm a little busy here...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=mast-4-pleased,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=mast-3-disappointed,I'm not stopping just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep at this.  You should have been more careful.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Just go back to the game and stop trying to trick me.  If you hadn't noticed, all you've got left is that tiny thong.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=mast-4-pleased,Can't believe you're busy trying to trick me when your only defense is a thin strip of fabric.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Stop trying to trick <i>me</i> and focus on deceiving your opponents.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Poker is a game all about lying, so keep it up...apparently I'm very honest.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,There's a lot of visual teasing on the Nirvana...nice to see a payoff for once.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,<i>Finally</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-4-pleased,Now I can <i>really</i> get going.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,Just smile, ~name~.  You'll feel better.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=mast-3-pleased,If this is bothering you...well, it's every day on the Nirvana.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-2-pleased,I can't help it...it makes me feel alive to push myself.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-2-pleased,Can't you see the appeal of a good challenge?  To rise above who you were before?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,I want to fall asleep every night knowing I'm better than I was yesterday.  That's the essence of competition.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Surely you understand the value in self-improvement, right?  That's what I love about games.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=mast-3-disappointed,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=mast-3-disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=mast-3-disappointed,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=mast-3-disappointed,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=mast-3-pleased,I thought men liked breasts more.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=mast-3,Most women would take off their bras first...like I did, despite my reservations.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=mast-3-pleased,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-3-pleased,...Did you not expect that to happen?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-4-pleased,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-3-disappointed,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=mast-4-pleased,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-pleased,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=mast-4-pleased,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-4-pleased,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=mast-3-disappointed,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=mast-2-disappointed,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,I <i>lost</i> to this girl...this is the biggest blow to my pride in a while.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Can't believe I lost to a girl who <i>wanted</i> to lose...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,I used to think you had no decency, Jura...but next to this girl, and me masturbating, you're downright chaste.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-4-pleased,A <i>picture</i>, you mean?  ...I ask that you don't take any photos of me like <i>this</i>.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-3-pleased,If this "selfie" is a picture, I'd appreciate it if you avoided taking any pictures of me...naked and on the floor.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-3-pleased,This is a bit of a compromising position for a squadron leader...so keep your photos to Jura.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-3-pleased,I hope you're respectful enough to just photograph Jura...and not me, masturbating on the floor like a fool.

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,I thought men liked breasts more...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,Most women would take off their bras first...like me.

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=mast-3-disappointed,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=mast-3-disappointed,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=mast-3-pleased,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=mast-3-pleased,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=mast-3-pleased,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-4-pleased,Women's bodies are just <i>better</i>.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Maybe it's weird to you, but I was raised to see other women this way...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,The Harvest would certainly want a piece of <i>you</i>...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=mast-3-pleased,Normally I only have my imagination...alone in my room.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=mast-2-pleased,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=mast-2-pleased,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=mast-3-pleased,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=mast-2-pleased,This is thrilling you, isn't it?  Shame I lost...but at least I'm getting my <i>own</i> thrill.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Looks aren't everything.  Try improving your piloting skills sometime...or just your discipline.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,You've got looks, but you lack the discipline to maintain them.  You're going to need it...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,You could do with some self-improvement in the gym...you'd be surprised how muscles would improve your self-image.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=mast-4-pleased,I'd highly recommend the gym all the same.  If you think you're beautiful now, muscles would push you into the cosmos.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=mast-3-disappointed,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=mast-3-disappointed,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=mast-4-disappointed,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=mast-4-disappointed,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=mast-4-disappointed,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=mast-3-pleased,...I see.  I wouldn't live my life based on what men want, though.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=mast-3-pleased,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=mast-3-pleased,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...guess I should have, since my strategizing didn't help.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,You sure aren't shy about it.  Neither am I, apparently.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I'm still bitter about it.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I only <i>tolerate</i> being nude, and this is even worse.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=mast-4-pleased,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would mean I'd <i>never</i> do this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,Privacy is not the priority of our ship's showers...or of Mejare in general.  So yes, I have.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=mast-4-pleased,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-2-pleased,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-pleased,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-4-disappointed,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-4-disappointed,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=mast-4-disappointed,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=mast-4-disappointed,And after all that, you look perfectly fine.  What was the issue with this?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=mast-4-disappointed,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=mast-4-disappointed,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=mast-3-disappointed,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,What did you expect?  ...Not sure what I did.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=mast-4-pleased,Even the die is getting sick of this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=mast-4-pleased,If this doesn't prove the existence of fate, I don't know what does.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-4-disappointed,See what happens?  I <i>told</i> you to be careful!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-4-pleased,You're...?  Even Barnette isn't <i>that</i> big on guns...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=mast-2-disappointed,<i>Now</i> do you understand?  Don't throw your life away.

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=stretching-2,If you were planning on captivating me, you waited a little too long.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,How do you stack up against the three men I actually know?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=stretching-2,You've kept me waiting long enough.  My curiosity is mostly gone now.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=interested-2,You're hardly covering your chest anyway, ~name~.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Come on, ~name~, let me make Jura jealous.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing-2,You don't look all that muscular.  I suppose Hibiki proves that isn't a <i>necessity</i> for a man, but still.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=pleased-2,Funny.  Hibiki would definitely be a lot braver in this situation, despite his complete lack of poker skills.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=addressing-2,If you're feeling self-conscious about your musculature, try Tarakkian food pellets.  You won't enjoy the taste, though.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed-2,I was curious about a man's chest...but apparently you're not a man.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored-2,And here I thought I might see a man's chest.  But no, I get an overgrown machine.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored-2,Tell me your modelers at least got male anatomy right.  That way I could learn something about them...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed-2,...So were you built to male anatomical specifications?  Because I <i>am</i> curious what men look like naked.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,If you were planning on captivating me, you waited a little too long.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,How do you stack up against the three men I actually know?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,You've kept me waiting long enough.  My curiosity is mostly gone now.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,You're hardly covering your chest anyway, ~name~.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Come on, ~name~, Jura really wants to see this...I'm indifferent.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny-2,All those muscles...I might have to go another round.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny-2,This still feels a little alien...but in a good way.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=interested-2,I could have used a peek at that while I was masturbating...
-1-male_chest_is_visible=addressing-2,Maybe I should get myself a...what's the word?  <i>Boyfriend</i>?
-1-male_chest_is_visible=horny-2,I know men and women are supposed to feel this way about each other...it's welling up inside me.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=bored-2,Hm.  I thought men had nipples...Mejarians <i>like</i> nipples, you know.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=bored-2,I had heard men had nipples...maybe some do, and some don't?  Shame...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=stretching-2,So you don't have any nipples?  Mejarians appreciate nipples, as you might imagine...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking-2,No nipples?  I could have sworn the book showed men with some, but then I don't see why they <i>would</i>...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=pleased-2,I guess those wings really <i>are</i> part of your body.  Fascinating, but it can't help me now.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=addressing-2,So...men come in different varieties, given your wings?  I think I prefer normal men, but maybe that's the afterglow talking.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=pleased-2,Were you born with those wings, or are they the result of some experimentation Tarak should know about?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed-2,I was about to comment on your chest, but...that underwear is distracting.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=impressed-2,Huh.  I would have thought men wore different underwear than women, on account of that tube-thing.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=addressing-2,For a man...you look very feminine.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=pleased-2,Bart dressed up like a woman once, too...men should really avoid doing that.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry-2,I thought you said you were a man!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused-2,OK, now I'm <i>really</i> confused.  Men can have breasts?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=stressed-2,...So you're a woman?  Are you making fun of me?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=pleased-2,If you want to appeal to both men and women, I wouldn't recommend a horrific mishmash of the two.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=addressing-2,Speaking as a woman...that's not very appealing.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Shame I couldn't force you to show your thing myself...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased-2,This should have been <i>my</i> victory...instead it's my anatomy lesson.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Don't men <i>like</i> to just whip it out?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested-2,Let me see.  It already looks uncomfortable in there.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=afterglow,Your tube-thing...I could have used <i>this</i> earlier.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored-2,After the questionable accuracy of your chest, I'm not too excited to see your tube...if you <i>have</i> one.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=bored-2,Show me your tube if you want...apparently it's not the genuine article.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed-2,Forgive me for not being excited.  I doubt whatever you have is what human men are actually sporting...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=disappointed-2,I can't get excited about an android's...tube.  It's probably missing some key features from the real thing.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed-2,Hm.  Glad you didn't unveil <i>that</i> when I was trying to finish...
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=unimpressed-2,Breathtaking.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed-2,Well, it does make you a smaller target...
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=awkward-2,...I didn't think men and women could get <i>that</i> similar.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=disappointed-2,Earth women must not like that size...my body doesn't.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=stretching-2,You're hard...and I'm getting wet again.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,I wonder how it tastes...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=addressing-2,Here's hoping you're forced to masturbate...so I can see that, too.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=impressed-2,The book didn't really tell me what to do with that thing...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=pleased-2,Well, you did manage to control yourself earlier...so I guess men aren't <i>total</i> beasts.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=addressing-2,Ah...there it is.  You sure made me wait to see it.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,<i>Finally</i>...I had to use my imagination.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed-2,So that's the real thing.  Masturbating to it would have been strange...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=pleased-2,Figures men would just have a big blunt rod compared to a woman's complex inner workings.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing-2,You've got Hibiki's size everywhere else, so I guess that's what I could expect from him...but that's beside the point.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=addressing-2,For someone who seems to have a comment for everyone, you're a bit of a shrinking violet.  If I could handle <i>this</i>, I don't understand your concern.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=pleased-2,At least Hibiki has the courage to match his bluster.  Shyness doesn't suit a man...but then, public nudity doesn't suit <i>me</i>.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=addressing-2,I didn't think I'd get a first taste of those tubes from an <i>artificial</i> example, but I suppose that's easier.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=interested-2,An android's fake tube...what's the actual word?  <i>Penis</i>?  That's it...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=addressing-2,So does that thing work, or is it just for show?  ...That's not an invitation to try anything.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=stretching-2,Is that thing real enough to satisfy my curiosity, 9S?  ...Don't get any ideas.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny-2,Too bad you couldn't show that thing off for me before...it would have really thrown me for a loop.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=afterglow,You're driving me wild over here...I don't appreciate that.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked-2,<i>That</i> would have broken my composure.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=impressed-2,...Do Earth women tend to be taller?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=afterglow,Ooh...I might have to go again.  Later.  Alone.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=impressed-2,...OK, I've <i>seen</i> pictures of how big it should be.  You have a disease, Ryu.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward-2,That thing wouldn't fit in my <i>Dread</i>, much less me.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=pleased-2,...Now I understand why women formed their own planet.  Too many were dying during sex.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=angry-2,So...you <i>are</i> a man.  Stop confusing me!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=pleased-2,Your creator must have been pretty absentminded.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=confused-2,I've seen pictures.  That's far too big to be a penis, or whatever it's called.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased-2,Jura wouldn't need a game to flash hers...and Barnette pretty much is all the time.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny-2,At least I can enjoy this without the game hanging overhead.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=pleased-2,Let's not delay the inevitable...now I'm sounding like that Earthling.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,Come on, I've absorbed the embarrassment for you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=addressing-2,You'll find it strangely relaxing.  I did, anyway.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=pleased-2,I'd be more concerned about Jura if she <i>was</i>.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing-2,Sounds like the Jura Basil Elden I know and tolerate, actually.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching-2,I assumed as much, actually.  She usually knows when to stop teasing and deliver...like right before an enemy kills us.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing-2,I'm sure she's got some kind of skimpy thong.  Just enough fabric to keep teasing even more...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed-2,Is nudity even on your radar?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed-2,Feel free to follow the rules at some point and actually expose yourself.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska=unimpressed-2,Aren't you getting tired of this?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=bored-2,I don't drink because...well, let's not kill the mood.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=pleased-2,Yes.  You're very clever.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=pleased-2,Jura goes through too much rum for us to get fancy with it.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored-2,...Mejare actually has very little foliage.  This might have proven fascinating if you hadn't used it to cheat.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed-2,Your powers are actually quite spectacular...Mejare doesn't have much greenery.  But instead, you choose to use them like this.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored-2,At least you're <i>technically</i> stripping again.  It's sad...I would've appreciated seeing all this, since Mejare has little vegetation.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=disappointed-2,Had you not been cheating, I would've liked a conversation with you about all these plants...they're rare on Mejare.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed-2,Just stop already...I'm not giving you ammunition on this.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=disappointed-2,If I say anything, you'll extrapolate and never let me hear the end of it.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=unimpressed-2,Anything I tell you, the whole crew will know.  I'm staying professional on this.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=bored-2,I really needed to win this game...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Barnette is essentially flashing hers all the time.  Is that how you fell in love with her, Jura?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=horny-2,At least I can enjoy this without the game hanging overhead.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Let's not delay the inevitable...now I'm sounding like that Earthling.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Come on, I've absorbed the embarrassment for you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,You'll find it strangely relaxing.  I did, anyway.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,If you weren't so careless with your own life, I'd commend your aim.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=pleased-2,You'd make a fine pilot with that aim if you had a shred of self-preservation.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=addressing-2,Your technical skills are remarkable.  Too bad they're in service of ridiculous posturing.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=bored-2,I don't drink because...well, let's not kill the mood.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Yes.  You're very clever.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Ask Jura where the rum disappears to.  We can't get fancy with it.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed-2,What is <i>wrong</i> with you?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed-2,I came here for a card game, not to flaunt my indecency.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,If most Earth women are like you, I can see why the colonists left.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,You really need a hobby.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=angry-2,You're just losing on purpose.  Stop wasting my time.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=impressed-2,Cute little things.  Are you still a child?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,I wonder if Earth food is short on hormones...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,Right up there with Misty.  I guess it gets cold on Pluto...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy-2,It's not the size of the ship...it's the grace in space.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,Puts my anxiety into perspective...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=impressed-2,Maybe Mejarians are uncommonly endowed...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=impressed-2,Uh...alright then.  I guess you listened.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing-2,You didn't know the die could do that?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:vriska=addressing-2,So you could have lost far before this if you were unlucky?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased-2,For all its faults, Mejare's government <i>does</i> encourage breast health.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=addressing-2,There's no gravity in space...helps them sit higher, if you follow.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested-2,This is cathartic, following my loss...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested-2,Those would have been a good masturbation aid...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy-2,I've always considered breasts a good indicator of health.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=bored-2,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=bored-2,I know I've already masturbated, Jura, so maybe this holds no weight...but you're not flirtatious.  <i>This</i> girl is flirtatious.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=bored-2,At least <i>pretend</i> to care you're losing, just to put us at ease about your sanity.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,What good is sex if you'd do it with just <i>anyone</i>?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,I take back anything I've said about Jura being flirtatious.  You've shown me new lows.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased-2,There's no way you can call me boring that Jura hasn't already dreamt up.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=stretching-2,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=interested-2,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=addressing-2,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=interested-2,I masturbated, didn't I?  That's always fun.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=pleased-2,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored-2,Is there something wrong with your breasts?  At least face us.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=addressing-2,Don't tell me you lack the nerve to look us in the eye like this.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed-2,For someone so sure of her superiority, you seem rather embarrassed to look at us like this.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed-2,Don't ask me what would possess a woman to play strip poker when she's too embarrassed to face us nude.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,Is there a doctor in this place?  We all know how these stunts are going to end.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=pleased-2,You're really asking for an accident.  Where's Duero when you need him?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=bored-2,I just don't understand you.  And not in an interesting way.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,You and Jura can poke fun at me all you want.  I'm in a good mood now.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,For an Earth woman, you sure have an interest in the female body.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,Funny.  I thought Earth women had little interest in each other.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Maybe you'd break my stoicism if you said something interesting.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,I masturbated, didn't I?  That's always fun.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,I see the White Knights choose their soldiers based on professionalism and poise.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=bored-2,I'll admit, I have a little breast envy...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking-2,...They really are nice.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=disappointed-2,Credit where it's due...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking-2,You really do have a magnificent chest...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking-2,I need to get over this...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=unimpressed-2,You're one to talk, Jura.  <i>I</i> haven't shoved his face into my cleavage.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=unimpressed-2,Says the woman who asks for his seed on a weekly basis.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=bored-2,I'd say you're projecting your feelings towards him onto me, but you've always been quite clear about them...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=disappointed-2,<i>Me</i> with a man?  Don't count on it...they're too simple.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=unimpressed-2,Figures you wouldn't recognize the difference between respect and love.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stretching-2,What?  Oh, your glasses...no, I don't see them.  And I'm trying to relax here...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stretching-2,Surely you're not blind enough to not see the cards.  Let me sit here...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=pleased-2,You really flung them off like that...I guess you're not used to pulling off your sweater that way.  Moving on...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=disappointed-2,I'm not moving just because you're careless.  Are you really that blind?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stretching-2,Parfet's not much better without her glasses...still, I'm going to keep relaxing here.  You should have been more careful.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny-2,~name~...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased-2,I wonder what the captain looked like at your age...or mine.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,I could have used this while I was masturbating, you know.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=pleased-2,No way I was staying stoic tonight...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=addressing-2,It's only fair, after all I've done for you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=addressing-2,Considering the outcome of your last roll, I'd be wary.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored-2,At this point, you might as well just strip properly.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=thinking-2,Random chance is <i>not</i> how I want to live my life...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching-2,A <i>picture</i>, you mean?  ...I ask that you don't take any photos of me like <i>this</i>.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased-2,If this "selfie" is a picture, I'd appreciate it if you avoided taking any pictures of me...naked and on the floor.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=stretching-2,This is a bit of a compromising position for a squadron leader...so keep your photos to Jura.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=afterglow,I hope you're respectful enough to just photograph Jura...and not me, sitting on the floor like a fool.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=disappointed-2,...Did you not expect that to happen?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=bored-2,Flimsy material...you ought to get something form-fitting and supportive.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=annoyed-2,Were you unaware of how loose your underwear was?  <i>Royals</i>...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=unimpressed-2,This is what happens when you dress for fashion over function.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed-2,With powers like that, you could keep this up forever.  Why you're giving up now, I don't understand.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=bored-2,You've already cheated.  Might as well keep going until we lose by attrition.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed-2,At least you've finally got some honor.  Too little, too late, but I thought you were just going to cheat until you won.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=disappointed-2,No more tricks?  At this point I had resigned myself to you cheating your way to victory.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed-2,You'd...rather take <i>that</i> off first?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=impressed-2,I thought men liked breasts more...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=pleased-2,Most women would take off their bras first...like me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=pleased-2,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=pleased-2,No woman does disingenuous quite like you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=addressing-2,Touching.  But you could always use some tough love.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=interested-2,I know you're joking, but...stand strong against your enemy, no matter how bad things get.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=interested-2,I know you can win, Jura.  You can stop being facetious.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=confused-2,You're taking <i>that</i> off first?  Why?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=thinking-2,<i>I'm</i> ashamed of my breasts...but I wouldn't give that away by hiding them longer than needed.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=impressed-2,I thought men liked breasts more.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=pleased-2,Most women would take off their bras first...like I did, despite my reservations.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=addressing-2,Mejarians are taught to preserve our reproductive organs above all else...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=confused-2,Uh...what are you doing to Marinette?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed-2,Hey, did Marinette ask for that?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching-2,<i>Awkward</i>?  Awkward is when Jura forgets the formations I order us to take.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=addressing-2,To be honest, Elizabeth, this seems a lot more awkward for <i>you</i>.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=pleased-2,<i>Awkward</i>?  Only mildly.  I'm just disappointed in her, that's all.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested-2,I couldn't work with Jura if nudity made me uncomfortable, believe me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=stretching-2,A <i>picture</i>, you mean?  ...I ask that you don't take any photos of me like <i>this</i>.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=pleased-2,If this "selfie" is a picture, I'd appreciate it if you avoided taking any pictures of me...naked and on the floor.

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,I <i>lost</i> to this girl...this is the biggest blow to my pride in a while.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Can't believe I lost to a girl who <i>wanted</i> to lose...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,Earthling or not, no woman should be this obsessed with sex...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=bored-2,I'm sorry for implying you were oversexed, Jura.  First I masturbate, and then...<i>this</i> girl.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,I <i>lost</i> to this girl...this is the biggest blow to my pride in a while.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,Can't believe I lost to a girl who <i>wanted</i> to lose...

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=disappointed-2,You're a little <i>too</i> familiar with men...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,Next to you, Jura is the very picture of chastity.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested-2,I think you just enjoy having your partner do this for you.  Are you and Nadeshiko together?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=impressed-2,That's...pretty intimate.  I know you two work together...but is your relationship more than that?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy-2,I'm sorry for prying, but you seem so close already.  Are you and Nadeshiko dating?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=addressing-2,I'm used to seeing women in love, so maybe this is prying on Earth...but are you two more than colleagues?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=impressed-2,My suit is one thing...that really looks uncomfortable.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=pleased-2,You're barely more covered than Barnette with that thing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=addressing-2,That leotard looks like a bodysuit without the coverage...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=confused-2,Your <i>underwear</i>?  With the sweater still on?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed-2,No bra...I suppose removing your sweater would be just as immodest, then.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=confused-2,Don't you still have--well, it's your decision.  Underwear first...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=disappointed-2,You said you don't have a bra?  Well, that explains your choice, then...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,You sure aren't shy about it.  Take notes, Jura--you could always improve.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=bored-2,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  Having that scar would keep me far away from this game.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=pleased-2,You sure aren't shy about it.  You really <i>would</i> hit it off with Jura.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed-2,At least you're <i>happy</i> to be losing.  I can't stand it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=disappointed-2,Part of me applauds exhibitionism.  I <i>tolerate</i> being nude, but I don't <i>like</i> it.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible=stretching-2,You look nice, ~name~.  Groin stretches work wonders.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=addressing-2,A woman who doesn't take care of her body...is a very ghastly sight indeed.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,The hallmark of a good pilot...is to stand strong against your opponent.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,Doesn't it thrill you?  Fighting so close to the edge?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested-2,Win where I couldn't, ~name~...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed-2,...This game is getting to be too much for me.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking-2,Bondage...<i>no thanks</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=bored-2,I hate being tied up...I hate tight spaces.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry-2,...Don't you <i>dare</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry-2,<i>Tie me up and you'll regret it.</i>
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen,marker:claustrophobia=angry-2,Come anywhere near me with that webbing and the Nirvana will be paying your planet a visit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry-2,<i>Now</i> what are you doing?  Attacking us for losing?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry-2,What are you--why is your hand glowing?  What is this?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry-2,Are you threatening us now?  Should've expected as much.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=angry-2,Are you--w-what's this glowing all about?  Strange powers you were hiding?

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=bored-2,Is there some defect on your body I'm not seeing?  What was the point of that flower business?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed-2,<i>That</i> was what you were so anxious to cover?  You look like a perfectly healthy young girl.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=disappointed-2,I'm glad you wasted all of our time, only to lose anyway and reveal a body that's perfectly fine.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,If you're referring to her lack of pubic hair, I understand that Earth's opinion on the subject is quite divergent from Mejare's...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stretching-2,<i>Clean</i>?  Mejarians are fans of cleanliness.  And Jura spends quite a bit of her time in the spa...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested-2,Yes, I've seen it.  And that cleanliness is mostly the handiwork of the spa attendants.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,marker:pubic_hair_comments=pleased-2,I prefer shaved.  More aerodynamic.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=disappointed-2,So you've actually been with men?  ...Are they worth the trouble?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=pleased-2,I didn't really think about my stripping order ahead of time...guess I should have, since my strategizing didn't help.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=pleased-2,At least that sweater actually obscures your figure for all its surface area.  I can't say the same for my suit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=pleased-2,Seems more like you find this exciting, but then you could make similar assumptions from my suit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=addressing-2,No use pulling it down like that...<i>I've</i> resigned myself to how revealing my suit is.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=pleased-2,That thing hides quite a bit, at least...unlike my suit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy-2,Don't take that as insulting.  It's great to see two fit women making a living without men.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=happy-2,I'm glad to see women are keeping themselves fit and happy without the need for men, all the same.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested-2,In any case, you should both be proud of your bodies.  You certainly enjoy being viewed...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=interested-2,Regardless, I can't fault the choices of women who take care of themselves.  I hope you're both happy together.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=bored-2,You sure aren't shy about it.  Neither am I, apparently, and I'm worse at cards.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=disappointed-2,Can't believe I lost to a drunkard.  What a bitter night.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=pleased-2,Part of me applauds exhibitionists.  Apparently I now count as one, though.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=pleased-2,At least you're comfortable in your skin.  This was just awful for me to have to do.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored-2,I'm not giving you the satisfaction...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,I went the first nineteen years of my life without meeting a man, and yet <i>you're</i> obsessed with them.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=pleased-2,You're like if Dita had her obsession with men, but none of the innocence.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#fully clothed
0-male_must_masturbate=pleased,Dita would be beside herself, seeing one of her "aliens" breed like this.

0-male_must_masturbate=impressed,I wonder how you'll do it...the book didn't go into detail.
0-male_must_masturbate=addressing,For me to push you this far, and so easily...you must be ashamed.

0-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=addressing,I didn't think my introduction to men would include a fake one, but...perhaps you're real enough for this.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=addressing,Don't feel bad, 9S.  You couldn't beat a human woman...but now you can act like a human man.
0-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one=bored,Pathetic.
0-male_must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one=bored,To hide behind others, and then have your incompetence revealed...shameful.

0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=awkward,I can't believe you were programmed to handle sexuality at all.  Your creators are cruel if they didn't want you doing anything...
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=impressed,Surely you were programmed to <i>act</i> on sexual desires, right?  Or what is it I'm witnessing?
0-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=calm,First, a man masturbating...but him being mechanical just further compounds the mystery.  And this is normal to you?

0-male_masturbating,target:9s=pleased,You're about as diminuitive as another man I work closely with...which makes this a bit awkward.
0-male_masturbating,target:9s=addressing,Whatever it is you're processing, I'm sure I'd find it fascinating.  You can share.

1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura,priority:1001=bored,Well, at least you made me lose <i>once</i>.  Take that back with you to brag about.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura,priority:1001=unimpressed,...I hope you're not proud of this performance.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura,priority:1001=bored,Great...I know what's coming <i>now</i>.  At least I didn't sweep you.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura,priority:1001=thinking,I maintain that you're good at cards, Jura.  But you don't <i>try</i>.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=confused,...I'm sorry, what?  A USB?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=confused,A real person?  What were you before?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina,marker:shyness=thinking,It's OK, Florina, really.  I won't do anything.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina,marker:shyness=disappointed,You look fine...you don't need to be so embarrassed.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina,marker:shyness=thinking,I understand.  Being close to people isn't easy for me, either...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=awkward,After your outlandish ways of covering yourself, I can only imagine how you'll masturbate.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=bored,This ought to be a spectacle, after the way you merely <i>clothed</i> yourself.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=awkward,I'm not sure I want to see what you pull out to accomplish <i>this</i>.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=disappointed,Assuming you'll follow the rules, this is going to be something else...or you'll just shield yourself from view completely.
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,I wonder how you'll do it.  Ask Jura...apparently I need to take the edge off, isn't that right?
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,A fellow woman falls...I'm getting survivor's guilt.
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,You really think I don't do this enough, Jura?  Are you sure you don't just do it <i>too much</i>?
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Loss stings quite a bit...I would know.
1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=thinking,Make a stage for yourself, ~name~...people will listen.
1-female_must_masturbate,totalFemales:5-5=awkward,I'm very curious what a man might think of this...
1-female_must_masturbate,totalFemales:5-5=pleased,I know a few Tarakkian prisoners who'd find this very fascinating...
1-female_must_masturbate,totalFemales:5-5=disappointed,I know I'll enjoy the show...but how do Earth women feel?
1-female_must_masturbate,totalFemales:5-5=thinking,I hear a man would lose control of himself at the sight of this...
1-female_must_masturbate,totalFemales:5-5=pleased,Just like our crew poker nights...minus the self-gratification.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=impressed,I <i>definitely</i> wouldn't leave my sexuality up to chance.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=unimpressed,Give it a rest already.  You lost.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=unimpressed,<i>That's</i> definitely cheating.  Just leave.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=surprised-horny,What is <i>that</i> thing?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=disappointed,A toy?  Toys just dull your body's sensitivity.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=disappointed,I can't believe you brought that thing with you.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=pleased,Well, you're being a good sport about it.  I suppose the alcohol helps there.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=addressing,I wonder if you'd have the nerve to do this sober.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=addressing,A drunk woman's sexuality is never a pleasant sight.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=addressing,I find sex is a lot more intimate when your vision isn't a blur.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=confused,You're going to do <i>what</i>?  I wasn't expecting a performance.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=impressed,Putting on a <i>play</i>?  I was a little girl when I last saw a play...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa,marker:oma_and_fama=annoyed,My Fama took me to a play once...<i>I Married a Tarakkian Sympathizer</i>.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa,marker:oma_and_fama=annoyed,My Fama took me to a play once.  It was about a woman who fell in love with a man, who then ate her.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa,marker:shyness=calm,You don't have to be so embarrassed, Nagisa.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=surprised-horny,Well, Morrigan, you--<i>who's that</i>?  What's going on?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=surprised-horny,Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Morrigan, you know this woman?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked,...<i>Lilith</i>?  You know this woman, Morrigan?  You're--<i>sisters</i>?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=bored,Wait, what?  Where was she hiding?  <i>Succubus magic</i>...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=smug,Sorry to see you go, Sei.  Perhaps you should have stayed sober.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=pleased,Knowing you, Sei, this is what you came here for anyway.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=smug,I hope being drunk doesn't dull your sensitivity.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=unimpressed,What a surprise.  The nymphomaniac lost.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=unimpressed,How about you stop talking and listen for once?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=disappointed,You get to make a fool of yourself, and I get to play without you wasting my time.  Everyone wins.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=disappointed,...Is Nadeshiko coming out for <i>this</i>, too?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=calm,Good job holding out, with so little clothing...is Nadeshiko tagging in now?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=smug,You're very theatric, but I guess you knew better than to drag it out.  Is Nadeshiko coming in now?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=addressing,Nadeshiko was stripping, too, so I can't imagine she can help you here.
1-female_start_masturbating=disappointed,I see Earth women aren't much different when it comes to these things...
1-female_start_masturbating=awkward,Hard to stay stoic with a woman masturbating right next to you...
1-female_start_masturbating=bored,Mejarians get a lot of practice in this area...it's not like sex is all that different from it.
1-female_start_masturbating=disappointed,I was wondering if living around men would make Earth women a little shaky at this...
1-female_start_masturbating=addressing,As long as you didn't cheat, you can still walk away from this with some dignity.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Elizabeth, you're...I mean, there's...I've forgotten which one is which.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Elizabeth, you...you were capable of this all along?  I...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I'm never trusting my own judgment again.  You were just an embarrassed young girl...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What's happening</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,You're--you're not <i>serious</i>?  Here?  You'll hit someone!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=angry,You're--you're <i>wrestling</i> now?  There's people everywhere!  Someone will get hurt!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=angry,Hey, don't wrestle <i>here</i>!  That's dangerous!  Think of the people around you!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,Wha--what you are doing?  You'll get someone killed wrestling right here at the table!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,Do you <i>ever</i> stop swearing?  It's just crass.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=bored,You don't <i>have</i> to antagonize people, you know.  How about you make friends for a change?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,I hold people at arm's length...but you're much deeper down <i>that</i> hole.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=impressed,A chair...?  I kind of like how cold the floor feels...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=impressed,You really want us to see you do it, don't you?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=disappointed,So there <i>are</i> chairs in this place.  Why have we been standing this whole time?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=bored,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=thinking,With a full audience?  I do it alone...even <i>this</i> many people is a stretch.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=disappointed,That looks like too much stimulus...not for me.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed,What is <i>that</i>?  Oh, a vibrator...they're much bigger on Earth.  And more like men's...things.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I should've been wondering how you planned to masturbate with claws...a vibrator makes sense, though Mejare's aren't shaped like that.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed,Well, that solves the issue.  Earth's vibrators are certainly more...<i>phallic</i> than Mejare's.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=pleased,Mejarian vibrators aren't nearly as cylindrical as that...I suppose they don't want us growing attached to anything shaped like men's tubes.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,Have you really never masturbated?  At <i>all</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  Don't you feel pent-up?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Considering what Mejarian sex consists of, we've <i>all</i> masturbated.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  That's...honestly impressive.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  Call <i>this</i> girl sexless, Jura.  <i>I've</i> masturbated.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=disappointed,Are you sure about your sobriety, Misato?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=thinking,In my experience, drunks are the worst judges of their own sobriety.  My experience being Jura...and me.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=disappointed,I'd reevaluate your drunkenness if that's worrying to you.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,...Sometimes I hate being right.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,...Oh, dear.  You're not seriously--I didn't mean it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,...That wasn't an invitation to <i>do</i> anything crazy.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I don't understand you in the slightest.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=shocked,That's...far too much going on.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,I would never want that many hands on me...

1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised-horny,I need a ship to fly...I don't know <i>what</i> you're doing.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised-horny,You're...<i>flying</i>?

1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,...Uh...oh, God.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,My God!  Are you OK?  What's happened to you?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Vriska?  Are you OK?  <i>Vriska</i>!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Have fun...though you already are.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Anyone this obsessed with sex has nothing else going on in their lives.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Don't you train <i>poker-mon</i> or something?  Why don't you ever talk about that?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Don't you <i>ever</i> put that thing down?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=disappointed,Now you're going to <i>masturbate</i> with it?  I don't know what I expected.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I can respect passion for something...but not to the point of reckless stupidity.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,...This <i>Japan</i> planet isn't for me.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=impressed,...You're the strangest woman I've ever met.

1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=confused,Have you really never masturbated?  At <i>all</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=confused,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  Don't you feel pent-up?

1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=impressed,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  And Jura calls <i>me</i> sexless.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=smug,Knowing what I do about drunk women's sexuality, this isn't going to be pretty.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=pleased,Considering your drunken state, I'm not expecting anything graceful...or lengthy.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=addressing,...And my reward is a drunk nude woman making a fool of herself.

1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=impressed,So those wings really <i>weren't</i> for show.

1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed,...<i>Oh</i>.  Well, you've lost, so the rules don't matter much anyway.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Since this is just for our viewing pleasure, I suppose having help is irrelevant now.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=surprised-horny,You're...well, alright, then.  Surprisingly Mejarian from an Earth...succubus.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased,Well, if you're curious what Mejarian sex looks like, there it is...minus the flying.

1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=interested,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...I'd probably just sit on the floor.
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...mostly the floating, of course.  The masturbating I can do without.
1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.

1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I have a new respect for the powers Earth women wield.
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed,Absolutely incredible...and she kept it secret this whole time.  The restraint...

1-female_masturbating,target:jura=annoyed,I'll just look over here and wait for the exaggerated moans to stop.
1-female_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,Not sure I'll be able to look Barnette in the eye after this.  She'll be able to tell I saw you masturbate...
1-female_masturbating,target:jura=thinking,The showers are one thing...the <i>spa</i> is one thing.  <i>This</i>...should be reserved for a bedroom.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=annoyed,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...
1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need an exercise partner...someone who can push my limits like that.

1-female_finished_masturbating=disappointed,I don't like oversexed women...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=addressing,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=interested,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  Don't feel bad.  As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's what matters.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=happy,Seems you overwhelmed yourself.  That's fine...it just means you're healthy.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Are you alright, Ochako?  Seems you still need a better grasp of the power you wield.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=bored,...OK.  It's over.  Wipe yourself off, at least.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=disappointed,I think I can tell where your mind's been these last few weeks, and it wasn't piloting.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=disappointed,You'd better believe I'm putting your nose to the grindstone tomorrow.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=unimpressed,Well, now you've had your fun for the month.  I'm putting you in charge of the Dreads next mission so you learn some responsibility.

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pleased,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy,It's good to meet people in better shape...it lets you know how high you can climb.  Thank you.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God it's over.  Are you alright, Vriska?  Please tell me you're alright.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God the ropes are gone.  What <i>was</i> that?  Don't scare me like that!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  You got free, somehow.  Not sure what the fluid is...but I'm so sorry.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Hello again...Blue Launch.  If you're worried about your condition, you can come aboard the Nirvana.  We have a doctor.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Oh, good, you're back to the blue version.  I should take you to Duero to figure out what's wrong...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=calm,At least you're polite again.  Listen, I know a skilled doctor...perhaps he could figure out what's wrong with you.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=thinking,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=disappointed,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=disappointed,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.

2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,If you could teach us how to fly, that would certainly make the trip worthwhile.
2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I have to admit, Jura, if we learn how to fly, I will concede that coming here was a good idea.
2-female_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,At least I'm mostly clothed.  This would be even <i>more</i> awkward otherwise.
2-female_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,I imagine you're thinking of Barnette?  ...I <i>hope</i> so, anyway.
2-female_masturbating,target:jura=bored,I really never wanted to intrude on your sex life.  You share so much of it already that it'd never be necessary.
2-female_masturbating,target:jura=bored,At least this sort of thing doesn't bother you.  I'd be miserable...
2-female_masturbating,target:jura=disappointed,Are you OK, Jura?  I might as well start piling your clothes together...
2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=impressed,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...

2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=pleased,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=smug,I hope this isn't imposing on you, Videl...but I wouldn't mind learning to fly.  No one would ever question my authority again.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon=unimpressed,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
2-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward,Uh...I'll think I'll stick to my own methods.
2-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward,I'm a fan of new formations, but...only for piloting.
2-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward,...There's a level of "comfort" I don't really want to go past.
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=impressed,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=impressed,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=bored,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
2-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
2-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,Meeting you is really causing me to reevaluate my own abrasiveness...
2-female_masturbating,target:revy=bored,If this is what having sex with men does to you, then count me out.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Ready to change your ways, Jura?  This is what flirtatiousness gets you.
2-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Are you..is it...acting like a man's tube?
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,To be so embarrassed, and then have public sex with vegetation...I can get any read on you at all.
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,I see the embarrassment was just a front...since you're now having sex with plants.
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,You--<i>trust</i> those things?  You have magical powers, and <i>this</i> is how you use them?
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Is it going inside--oh my God.  Like...a man's thing, isn't it?
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=thinking,I shudder to think I'd ever reach the point where I need <i>that</i> to feel pleasure...
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=confused,At least I can <i>see</i> how Kyu is flying.  Videl's method escapes me.
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That's certainly <i>one</i> way to use your powers...I won't deny I'd try it if I had them.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=smug,Floating and masturbating...it must be quite the workout, having to suspend yourself as you lose control.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=interested,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...I'd probably just sit on the floor.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...mostly the floating, of course.  The masturbating I can do without.
2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Can you...get loose?  I hate being restrained...
2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  Do you want to be untied?  Has the die done this before?

2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,You're OK, right?  Being tied up doesn't bother you?  Vriska?

2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=surprised-horny,Your finger...are you...<i>really</i>?  Earth women are so beastly.
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed,Earth women are something else...that's just dirty.
2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=thinking,I'm conflicted...between your muscles and your choice of orifice.

2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=impressed,Hard to believe I'm standing next to a fairy...especially a <i>masturbating</i> one.
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=confused,Looks a little distracting to keep yourself afloat like that.
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=bored,Some girls might masturbate in their Dreads...that's the closest they'd get to <i>flying</i> while doing it.
2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  Yet not one Mejarian can do it.
2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Since Videl doesn't have wings, maybe I could actually <i>learn</i> her method...
2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,This really isn't what I expected out of all the strange Earth phenomena I might encounter tonight...levitated masturbation.
2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You're, uh...really getting into this.
2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Hear this dirty talk, Jura?  Your little conversations with Barnette keep me up at night.
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=impressed,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=addressing,I'd ask how you're flying, but you seem beyond normal humanity in too many other ways for me to learn.
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Bondage...?  Not for me...
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=impressed,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I can hardly watch this...are you alright?  You <i>chose</i> this, right?
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=impressed,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Two Earth women flying and masturbating...but apparently Videl wasn't <i>born</i> able to, so maybe there's hope for me.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.  Without any wings.
2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,Two women masturbating in the air is <i>not</i> what I thought this night would give me.  Still, I'd like to learn Videl's method...
2-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=thinking,You have a nice singing voice, Florina...like my Fama.
2-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=thinking,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
2-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=happy,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,For a mutual masturbation session, you two are...surprisingly not so intimate.  Must be the sibling relationship...
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Aren't you two sisters?  I guess that's why you're not touching more than necessary...
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,I suppose this is just sisters helping each other, and not any sort of romance...
2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased,You're reminding me of home...besides the fact you're sisters, which Mejare still frowns upon.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,Elizabeth, you...<i>she</i> really knew what to do right away.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Could you not have just masturbated with your hands?
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I have a new respect for the powers Earth women wield.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed,Absolutely incredible...and she kept it secret this whole time.  The restraint...
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=annoyed,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...
2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need an exercise partner...someone who can push my limits like that.
2-female_finished_masturbating=pleased,Not much different from how a Mejarian might do it...
2-female_finished_masturbating=pleased,Alright, you've had your fun.  Clean yourself up.
2-female_finished_masturbating=impressed,Well, you sure made it count.
2-female_finished_masturbating=horny,That was actually a little titillating.  Well done.
2-female_finished_masturbating=smug,All too easy, ~name~.  I'm up for another round anytime.
2-female_finished_masturbating=pleased,Maybe you focused on yourself a little <i>too</i> much...
2-female_finished_masturbating=impressed,Jura says <i>she</i> enjoys herself...but you're something else.
2-female_finished_masturbating=surprised-horny,Your groin looks a little red...
2-female_finished_masturbating=surprised-horny,What an intense session...I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were oversexed, but maybe not.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=bored,Well, that's that.  I hope you're happy, Jura...and that you give Barnette some attention tonight.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=disappointed,I'm still not sure your relationship is 100% stable if this is the sort of thing you do to take the edge off.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=bored,Tell Barnette you love her tonight, would you?  I don't want any dating squabbles in the middle of missions to come.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=disappointed,I hope this sudden urge to publicly masturbate isn't indicative of any relationship issues.  I'm not playing counselor for you two.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Hello again...Blue Launch.  If you're worried about your condition, you can come aboard the Nirvana.  We have a doctor.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Oh, good, you're back to the blue version.  I should take you to Duero to figure out what's wrong...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=calm,At least you're polite again.  Listen, I know a skilled doctor...perhaps he could figure out what's wrong with you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God it's over.  Are you alright, Vriska?  Please tell me you're alright.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God the ropes are gone.  What <i>was</i> that?  Don't scare me like that!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  You got free, somehow.  Not sure what the fluid is...but I'm so sorry.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Good...it's over.  Still, I want to thank you for showing me how far I still have to go, fitness-wise.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pleased,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy,It's good to meet people in better shape...it lets you know how high you can climb.  Thank you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=thinking,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Not much different from how a Mejarian might do it...
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Alright, you've had your fun.  Clean yourself up.
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Well, you sure made it count.
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=horny,That was actually a little titillating.  Well done.
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,All too easy, ~name~.  I'm up for another round anytime.
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Maybe you focused on yourself a little <i>too</i> much...
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,I think she's got you beat on the self-enjoyment, Jura.  That was something else.
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=surprised-horny,Your groin looks a little red...
2-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=surprised-horny,What an intense session...I thought <i>Mejarians</i> were oversexed, but maybe not.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed,As quickly as she came...she hardly said a thing.  What was she waiting for all this time?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=disappointed,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=addressing,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=interested,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  Don't feel bad.  As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's what matters.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=happy,Seems you overwhelmed yourself.  That's fine...it just means you're healthy.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Are you alright, Ochako?  Seems you still need a better grasp of the power you wield.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=disappointed,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.

3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Considering what Mejarian sex consists of, we've <i>all</i> masturbated.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  That's...honestly impressive.

3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=impressed,You really want us to see you do it, don't you?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=disappointed,So there <i>are</i> chairs in this place.  Why have we been standing this whole time?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=bored,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.

3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,I suppose this is just sisters helping each other, and not any sort of romance...
3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased,You're reminding me of home...besides the fact you're sisters, which Mejare still frowns upon.
3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  Yet not one Mejarian can do it.
3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Since Videl doesn't have wings, maybe I could actually <i>learn</i> her method...
3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,This really isn't what I expected out of all the strange Earth phenomena I might encounter tonight...levitated masturbation.

3-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=smug,I hope this isn't imposing on you, Videl...but I wouldn't mind learning to fly.  No one would ever question my authority again.
3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,Elizabeth, you...<i>she</i> really knew what to do right away.

3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed,Earth women are something else...that's just dirty.
3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=thinking,I'm conflicted...between your muscles and your choice of orifice.
3-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
3-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,Meeting you is really causing me to reevaluate my own abrasiveness...
3-female_masturbating,target:revy=bored,If this is what having sex with men does to you, then count me out.

3-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=thinking,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
3-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=happy,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=annoyed,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...
3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need an exercise partner...someone who can push my limits like that.
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=impressed,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
3-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=addressing,I'd ask how you're flying, but you seem beyond normal humanity in too many other ways for me to learn.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Two Earth women flying and masturbating...but apparently Videl wasn't <i>born</i> able to, so maybe there's hope for me.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.  Without any wings.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,Two women masturbating in the air is <i>not</i> what I thought this night would give me.  Still, I'd like to learn Videl's method...

3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,If you could teach us how to fly, that would certainly make the trip worthwhile.
3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I have to admit, Jura, if we learn how to fly, I will concede that coming here was a good idea.
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=impressed,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=impressed,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
3-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=bored,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
3-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,You're, uh...really getting into this.
3-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
3-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=bored,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
3-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Hear this dirty talk, Jura?  Your little conversations with Barnette keep me up at night.
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Bondage...?  Not for me...
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=impressed,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I can hardly watch this...are you alright?  You <i>chose</i> this, right?
3-female_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,I could probably grill you with formations questions as punishment, but that'd just drag this out.
3-female_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,Don't let the presence of your superior officer distract you, Jura...oh, who am I kidding.  It wouldn't.
3-female_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,I can't imagine any pilot but you having the gall to not only masturbate in front of me, but try to make <i>me</i> do the same.
3-female_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,I admit, Dita or Barnette would never have the nerve to drag me here and risk masturbating in front of me.
3-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=awkward,How do Earth women feel about each other, exactly...?
3-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed,Since we're here, Jura, I hope you realize you and Barnette keep me up at night.
3-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=horny,Anything caught your interest, ~name~?  I try to stay fit...

3-female_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
3-female_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.

3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=confused,At least I can <i>see</i> how Kyu is flying.  Videl's method escapes me.
3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=impressed,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
3-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
3-female_masturbating,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1,totalFinished:0-0=horny,...
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That's certainly <i>one</i> way to use your powers...I won't deny I'd try it if I had them.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=smug,Floating and masturbating...it must be quite the workout, having to suspend yourself as you lose control.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=interested,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...I'd probably just sit on the floor.
3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...mostly the floating, of course.  The masturbating I can do without.
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Can you...get loose?  I hate being restrained...
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  Do you want to be untied?  Has the die done this before?
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you sure you don't want the ropes undone?  Vriska?
3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,You're OK, right?  Being tied up doesn't bother you?  Vriska?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Are you..is it...acting like a man's tube?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,To be so embarrassed, and then have public sex with vegetation...I can get any read on you at all.
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,I see the embarrassment was just a front...since you're now having sex with plants.
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,You--<i>trust</i> those things?  You have magical powers, and <i>this</i> is how you use them?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Is it going inside--oh my God.  Like...a man's thing, isn't it?
3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=thinking,I shudder to think I'd ever reach the point where I need <i>that</i> to feel pleasure...
3-female_finished_masturbating=impressed,Maybe losing is the <i>real</i> goal in this game...
3-female_finished_masturbating=surprised-horny,You've gotten it all over yourself...
3-female_finished_masturbating=impressed,Have <i>I</i> ever been that messy?
3-female_finished_masturbating=impressed,You're something else.  Maybe you'd fit in my team somewhere...
3-female_finished_masturbating=interested,Taste yourself...it's a good indication of nutrition.
3-female_finished_masturbating=pleased,That's probably about as long as Dita makes it...
3-female_finished_masturbating=pleased,Barnette <i>says</i> she goes that long...but I have my doubts.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Hello again...Blue Launch.  If you're worried about your condition, you can come aboard the Nirvana.  We have a doctor.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=interested,Oh, good, you're back to the blue version.  I should take you to Duero to figure out what's wrong...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=calm,At least you're polite again.  Listen, I know a skilled doctor...perhaps he could figure out what's wrong with you.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=thinking,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,That was surprisingly understated.  I expected some kind of passionate cry at the end there.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,At least you had the dignity not to scream Barnette's name out.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=interested,What was <i>that</i> all about, Jura?  Did you actually show a hint of sincerity?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,I really didn't think your <i>orgasm</i> would be tasteful, but your surprised me.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,Funnily enough, that orgasm was the subtlest you've been all night.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=addressing,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=interested,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  Don't feel bad.  As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's what matters.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=happy,Seems you overwhelmed yourself.  That's fine...it just means you're healthy.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Are you alright, Ochako?  Seems you still need a better grasp of the power you wield.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God it's over.  Are you alright, Vriska?  Please tell me you're alright.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God the ropes are gone.  What <i>was</i> that?  Don't scare me like that!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  You got free, somehow.  Not sure what the fluid is...but I'm so sorry.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=disappointed,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed,As quickly as she came...she hardly said a thing.  What was she waiting for all this time?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=disappointed,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy,Good...it's over.  Still, I want to thank you for showing me how far I still have to go, fitness-wise.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pleased,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy,It's good to meet people in better shape...it lets you know how high you can climb.  Thank you.

4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=impressed,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  That's...honestly impressive.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=impressed,You've <i>never</i> masturbated?  And Jura calls <i>me</i> sexless.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Don't you <i>ever</i> put that thing down?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=disappointed,Now you're going to <i>masturbate</i> with it?  I don't know what I expected.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I can respect passion for something...but not to the point of reckless stupidity.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,...This <i>Japan</i> planet isn't for me.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=impressed,...You're the strangest woman I've ever met.

4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Elizabeth, you're...I mean, there's...I've forgotten which one is which.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Elizabeth, you...you were capable of this all along?  I...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I'm never trusting my own judgment again.  You were just an embarrassed young girl...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What's happening</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed,What is <i>that</i>?  Oh, a vibrator...they're much bigger on Earth.  And more like men's...things.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I should've been wondering how you planned to masturbate with claws...a vibrator makes sense, though Mejare's aren't shaped like that.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed,Well, that solves the issue.  Earth's vibrators are certainly more...<i>phallic</i> than Mejare's.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=pleased,Mejarian vibrators aren't nearly as cylindrical as that...I suppose they don't want us growing attached to anything shaped like men's tubes.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=confused,Singing...?  Well, whatever you need to do, I won't stop you.

4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=surprised-horny,Wait...are you <i>flying</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=impressed,So those wings really <i>weren't</i> for show.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=bored,...I suppose if I could fly, I'd masturbate that way, too.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=disappointed,Are you sure about your sobriety, Misato?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=thinking,In my experience, drunks are the worst judges of their own sobriety.  My experience being Jura...and me.

4-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
4-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=impressed,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
4-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=addressing,I'd ask how you're flying, but you seem beyond normal humanity in too many other ways for me to learn.

4-female_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,I have no interest in where your mind goes at a time like this.  Barnette is the only wholesome thing possible...
4-female_masturbating,target:jura=unimpressed,Oh, don't stare at my chest.  You see it every day in the showers.
4-female_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,Don't mind me.  Just keep on pleasuring yourself...this is your natural state of being, from what I can tell.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  Yet not one Mejarian can do it.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Since Videl doesn't have wings, maybe I could actually <i>learn</i> her method...
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,This really isn't what I expected out of all the strange Earth phenomena I might encounter tonight...levitated masturbation.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,Elizabeth, you...<i>she</i> really knew what to do right away.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Could you not have just masturbated with your hands?
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I have a new respect for the powers Earth women wield.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed,Absolutely incredible...and she kept it secret this whole time.  The restraint...
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Bondage...?  Not for me...
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=impressed,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
4-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I can hardly watch this...are you alright?  You <i>chose</i> this, right?
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,If you could teach us how to fly, that would certainly make the trip worthwhile.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I have to admit, Jura, if we learn how to fly, I will concede that coming here was a good idea.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon=unimpressed,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.

4-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  Do you want to be untied?  Has the die done this before?

4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That's certainly <i>one</i> way to use your powers...I won't deny I'd try it if I had them.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=smug,Floating and masturbating...it must be quite the workout, having to suspend yourself as you lose control.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=interested,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...I'd probably just sit on the floor.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...mostly the floating, of course.  The masturbating I can do without.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed,I can't help but watch...you're so <i>fit</i>.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=surprised-horny,Did you just...in your...<i>well then</i>.

4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed,Earth women are something else...that's just dirty.
4-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=thinking,I'm conflicted...between your muscles and your choice of orifice.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=annoyed,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...

4-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=pleased,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
4-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=smug,I hope this isn't imposing on you, Videl...but I wouldn't mind learning to fly.  No one would ever question my authority again.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
4-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Ready to change your ways, Jura?  This is what flirtatiousness gets you.

4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Two Earth women flying and masturbating...but apparently Videl wasn't <i>born</i> able to, so maybe there's hope for me.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.  Without any wings.
4-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,Two women masturbating in the air is <i>not</i> what I thought this night would give me.  Still, I'd like to learn Videl's method...

4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=impressed,Hard to believe I'm standing next to a fairy...especially a <i>masturbating</i> one.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=confused,Looks a little distracting to keep yourself afloat like that.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=bored,Some girls might masturbate in their Dreads...that's the closest they'd get to <i>flying</i> while doing it.

4-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=thinking,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.

4-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=bored,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,For a mutual masturbation session, you two are...surprisingly not so intimate.  Must be the sibling relationship...
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Aren't you two sisters?  I guess that's why you're not touching more than necessary...
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,I suppose this is just sisters helping each other, and not any sort of romance...
4-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased,You're reminding me of home...besides the fact you're sisters, which Mejare still frowns upon.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.
4-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=confused,At least I can <i>see</i> how Kyu is flying.  Videl's method escapes me.

4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,To be so embarrassed, and then have public sex with vegetation...I can get any read on you at all.
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,I see the embarrassment was just a front...since you're now having sex with plants.
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,You--<i>trust</i> those things?  You have magical powers, and <i>this</i> is how you use them?
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Is it going inside--oh my God.  Like...a man's thing, isn't it?
4-female_masturbating,target:amalia=thinking,I shudder to think I'd ever reach the point where I need <i>that</i> to feel pleasure...

4-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=impressed,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
4-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.

4-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Hear this dirty talk, Jura?  Your little conversations with Barnette keep me up at night.
4-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
4-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,Meeting you is really causing me to reevaluate my own abrasiveness...
4-female_masturbating,target:revy=bored,If this is what having sex with men does to you, then count me out.
4-female_finished_masturbating=surprised-horny,Oof.  You bring a lot of enthusiasm.

4-female_finished_masturbating=impressed,That's, uh...I didn't expect that kind of enthusiasm from an Earth woman.
4-female_finished_masturbating=addressing,Well done, ~name~.  Maybe there's a Dread with your name on it.
4-female_finished_masturbating=interested,At least you made the most of your loss...

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pleased,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=addressing,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=interested,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  Don't feel bad.  As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's what matters.

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=calm,At least you're polite again.  Listen, I know a skilled doctor...perhaps he could figure out what's wrong with you.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,And we all walk away very slightly dissatisfied.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,I really thought you'd cry out for Barnette or something equally embarrassing.  You two always keep me up at night.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,At least you were quiet for once.  Guess you <i>do</i> have a sensitive side.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,Funny.  You get quiet when most women get loud.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed,As quickly as she came...she hardly said a thing.  What was she waiting for all this time?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=disappointed,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=disappointed,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.

-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,...That wasn't an invitation to <i>do</i> anything crazy.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I don't understand you in the slightest.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Elizabeth, you're...I mean, there's...I've forgotten which one is which.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Elizabeth, you...you were capable of this all along?  I...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I'm never trusting my own judgment again.  You were just an embarrassed young girl...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,...<i>What's happening</i>?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=smug,Knowing what I do about drunk women's sexuality, this isn't going to be pretty.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=pleased,Considering your drunken state, I'm not expecting anything graceful...or lengthy.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=addressing,...And my reward is a drunk nude woman making a fool of herself.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Have fun...though you already are.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored,Anyone this obsessed with sex has nothing else going on in their lives.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Don't you train <i>poker-mon</i> or something?  Why don't you ever talk about that?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,You're--you're not <i>serious</i>?  Here?  You'll hit someone!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=angry,You're--you're <i>wrestling</i> now?  There's people everywhere!  Someone will get hurt!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=angry,Hey, don't wrestle <i>here</i>!  That's dangerous!  Think of the people around you!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,Wha--what you are doing?  You'll get someone killed wrestling right here at the table!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=disappointed,Are you sure about your sobriety, Misato?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=thinking,In my experience, drunks are the worst judges of their own sobriety.  My experience being Jura...and me.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=disappointed,I'd reevaluate your drunkenness if that's worrying to you.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed,What is <i>that</i>?  Oh, a vibrator...they're much bigger on Earth.  And more like men's...things.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I should've been wondering how you planned to masturbate with claws...a vibrator makes sense, though Mejare's aren't shaped like that.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed,Well, that solves the issue.  Earth's vibrators are certainly more...<i>phallic</i> than Mejare's.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=pleased,Mejarian vibrators aren't nearly as cylindrical as that...I suppose they don't want us growing attached to anything shaped like men's tubes.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=thinking,Looks like your play is a little nicer than the ones I've seen...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=thinking,Whatever helps you through it...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=thinking,Not a bad story.  Keep going.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,...Uh...oh, God.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,My God!  Are you OK?  What's happened to you?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Vriska?  Are you OK?  <i>Vriska</i>!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed,...<i>Oh</i>.  Well, you've lost, so the rules don't matter much anyway.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Since this is just for our viewing pleasure, I suppose having help is irrelevant now.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=surprised-horny,You're...well, alright, then.  Surprisingly Mejarian from an Earth...succubus.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased,Well, if you're curious what Mejarian sex looks like, there it is...minus the flying.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=confused,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=confused,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=confused,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=bored,I don't approve of this, so just get on with it.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=disappointed,Try to just make this a formality of losing, please.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=bored,Here we go...everything you could have hoped for, Jura.  Make it quick.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=thinking,Standing here nude makes this all the more uncomfortable, so just do what you have to...and don't stare at me.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=confused,Singing...?  Well, whatever you need to do, I won't stop you.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=calm,I thought Earth was more casual about sexuality...you aren't.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=thinking,You must have a song that means a lot to you...I do.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised-horny,I wasn't sure at first...but you're <i>definitely</i> flying.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised-horny,I need a ship to fly...I don't know <i>what</i> you're doing.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised-horny,You're...<i>flying</i>?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha,marker:country_as_planet=impressed,...This <i>Japan</i> planet isn't for me.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=impressed,...You're the strangest woman I've ever met.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=impressed,...Well, at least you look like a human being now.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=surprised-horny,Wait...are you <i>flying</i>?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=impressed,So those wings really <i>weren't</i> for show.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=bored,...I suppose if I could fly, I'd masturbate that way, too.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=bored,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=thinking,With a full audience?  I do it alone...even <i>this</i> many people is a stretch.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=disappointed,That looks like too much stimulus...not for me.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=surprised-horny,Wha--what are you--
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=surprised-horny,That's...far too much going on.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,I would never want that many hands on me...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Don't you <i>ever</i> put that thing down?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=disappointed,Now you're going to <i>masturbate</i> with it?  I don't know what I expected.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=bored,I can respect passion for something...but not to the point of reckless stupidity.
-3-female_masturbating=pleased,I walked in on Misty doing it once.  That's how she got her own room.
-3-female_masturbating=horny,I'm not one for the dating scene...but now I'm thinking about it.
-3-female_masturbating=pleased,I've heard Parfet does it in the engine room.
-3-female_masturbating=interested,I've worked hard to make my body presentable to other women...
-3-female_masturbating=interested,You have energy on par with the Paksis...
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Two Earth women flying and masturbating...but apparently Videl wasn't <i>born</i> able to, so maybe there's hope for me.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.  Without any wings.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,Two women masturbating in the air is <i>not</i> what I thought this night would give me.  Still, I'd like to learn Videl's method...
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,For a mutual masturbation session, you two are...surprisingly not so intimate.  Must be the sibling relationship...
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Aren't you two sisters?  I guess that's why you're not touching more than necessary...
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,I suppose this is just sisters helping each other, and not any sort of romance...
-3-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased,You're reminding me of home...besides the fact you're sisters, which Mejare still frowns upon.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=impressed,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=confused,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=pleased,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=smug,I hope this isn't imposing on you, Videl...but I wouldn't mind learning to fly.  No one would ever question my authority again.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=confused,At least I can <i>see</i> how Kyu is flying.  Videl's method escapes me.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  Yet not one Mejarian can do it.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=thinking,Since Videl doesn't have wings, maybe I could actually <i>learn</i> her method...
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=impressed,This really isn't what I expected out of all the strange Earth phenomena I might encounter tonight...levitated masturbation.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That's certainly <i>one</i> way to use your powers...I won't deny I'd try it if I had them.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=smug,Floating and masturbating...it must be quite the workout, having to suspend yourself as you lose control.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=interested,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...I'd probably just sit on the floor.
-3-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...mostly the floating, of course.  The masturbating I can do without.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon=unimpressed,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,Ready to change your ways, Jura?  This is what flirtatiousness gets you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=unimpressed,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,Elizabeth, you...<i>she</i> really knew what to do right away.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Could you not have just masturbated with your hands?
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=surprised-horny,...I have a new respect for the powers Earth women wield.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed,Absolutely incredible...and she kept it secret this whole time.  The restraint...
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=impressed,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
-3-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=disappointed,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Are you..is it...acting like a man's tube?
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,To be so embarrassed, and then have public sex with vegetation...I can get any read on you at all.
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed,I see the embarrassment was just a front...since you're now having sex with plants.
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,You--<i>trust</i> those things?  You have magical powers, and <i>this</i> is how you use them?
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised-horny,Is it going inside--oh my God.  Like...a man's thing, isn't it?
-3-female_masturbating,target:amalia=thinking,I shudder to think I'd ever reach the point where I need <i>that</i> to feel pleasure...
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=impressed,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=impressed,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
-3-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=bored,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.

-3-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=thinking,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
-3-female_masturbating,target:florina,targetTimeInStage:0-0=happy,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=impressed,Hard to believe I'm standing next to a fairy...especially a <i>masturbating</i> one.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=confused,Looks a little distracting to keep yourself afloat like that.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=bored,Some girls might masturbate in their Dreads...that's the closest they'd get to <i>flying</i> while doing it.
-3-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward,Uh...I'll think I'll stick to my own methods.
-3-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward,I'm a fan of new formations, but...only for piloting.
-3-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward,...There's a level of "comfort" I don't really want to go past.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=impressed,You're, uh...really getting into this.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=pleased,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=bored,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-3-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=pleased,You should hear the dirty talk Jura gives Barnette.  Carries right through the walls.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jura=smug,Don't expect any flirtatious comments.  You've taken them all for yourself.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jura=pleased,You flirt with everyone around you, but I <i>do</i> hope you focus on Barnette at times like this.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jura=smug,You really are impossible to work with.  I can't believe you'd come to a place like this <i>knowing</i> you might have to masturbate.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,I don't think we'll ever see eye-to-eye on this sort of thing, Jura...you're too tall, for starters.
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Can you...get loose?  I hate being restrained...
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  Do you want to be untied?  Has the die done this before?
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you sure you don't want the ropes undone?  Vriska?
-3-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,You're OK, right?  Being tied up doesn't bother you?  Vriska?
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=impressed,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
-3-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=addressing,I'd ask how you're flying, but you seem beyond normal humanity in too many other ways for me to learn.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed,I can't help but watch...you're so <i>fit</i>.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=surprised-horny,Did you just...in your...<i>well then</i>.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=surprised-horny,Your finger...are you...<i>really</i>?  Earth women are so beastly.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed,Earth women are something else...that's just dirty.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=thinking,I'm conflicted...between your muscles and your choice of orifice.
-3-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
-3-female_masturbating,target:revy=annoyed,Meeting you is really causing me to reevaluate my own abrasiveness...
-3-female_masturbating,target:revy=bored,If this is what having sex with men does to you, then count me out.

-3-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=annoyed,Hear this dirty talk, Jura?  Your little conversations with Barnette keep me up at night.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=annoyed,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised-horny,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=impressed,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...
-3-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need an exercise partner...someone who can push my limits like that.
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=surprised-horny,Bondage...?  Not for me...
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=impressed,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
-3-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking,I can hardly watch this...are you alright?  You <i>chose</i> this, right?
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased,If you could teach us how to fly, that would certainly make the trip worthwhile.
-3-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing,I have to admit, Jura, if we learn how to fly, I will concede that coming here was a good idea.

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pleased,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy,It's good to meet people in better shape...it lets you know how high you can climb.  Thank you.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=addressing,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=interested,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  Don't feel bad.  As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's what matters.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=happy,Seems you overwhelmed yourself.  That's fine...it just means you're healthy.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=smug,Are you alright, Ochako?  Seems you still need a better grasp of the power you wield.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed,As quickly as she came...she hardly said a thing.  What was she waiting for all this time?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=disappointed,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=annoyed,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God it's over.  Are you alright, Vriska?  Please tell me you're alright.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Thank God the ropes are gone.  What <i>was</i> that?  Don't scare me like that!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked,Are you OK, Vriska?  You got free, somehow.  Not sure what the fluid is...but I'm so sorry.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=disappointed,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,Is that really all it took?  I expected something more ceremonius from the woman who claims to leave Barnette catatonic half the time.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=smug,Not quite the masterful demonstration you led me to believe you'd give.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing,Forgive me for expecting a little more showmanship from such a flirtatious woman.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=smug,Awfully quiet, Jura.  When did you learn how to be subtle?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.

-2-male_must_masturbate=mast-4-pleased,<i>Perfect</i>...right when I needed it.
-2-male_must_masturbate=mast-4-pleased,Just what I was hoping for...a man touching his thing.
-2-male_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,Can a man last as long as I can?
-2-male_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,You can still tell people you defeated me...though I'll never admit it.
-2-male_must_masturbate=mast-4-pleased,Let's see how a veteran handles that tube...
-2-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=mast-4-pleased,If your plan was to get me in this situation, Jura...well, I can handle it.
-2-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=mast-2-pleased,My body really wants to see this...
-2-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=mast-4-pleased,Go for it, ~name~...but don't get any ideas.
-2-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=mast-3-pleased,Do it a safe distance away...wouldn't want you getting handsy.
-2-male_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=mast-3-pleased,You can look, but you can't touch.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=mast-3-pleased,Let's see if that enthusiasm carries over into <i>everything</i> you do...
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=mast-3-pleased,Well, this is going to teach me more than I ever wanted to know about men.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=mast-3-pleased,You speak with the enthusiasm of twelve men...does that translate over to this?
-2-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1=mast-4-pleased,If Jura's plan was to get me into this situation...then the joke's on her.
-2-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1=mast-2-pleased,My body really wants to see this...
-2-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1=mast-4-pleased,Go for it, ~name~...but don't get any ideas.
-2-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1=mast-3-pleased,Do it a safe distance away...wouldn't want you getting handsy.
-2-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1=mast-3-pleased,You can look, but you can't touch.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,If you're so insecure about your mechanical nature, 9S, masturbating is a very human thing to do...especially with someone else.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=mast-4-pleased,Feel free to show me just how real you are...is that thing fully functional?
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=mast-2-pleased,I didn't think my introduction to men would include a fake one, but...perhaps you're real enough to excite me.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,Don't feel bad, 9S.  You seem very human to me...masturbating will only further cement that.
-2-male_start_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Now, to see how my body reacts to this...
-2-male_start_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Let me see what a man can do.
-2-male_start_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Such a simple motion, but so effective...
-2-male_start_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Come on...<i>I want to lose control</i>.
-2-male_start_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,No grace at all, huh?
-2-male_start_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Don't get any ideas...I don't even know you.
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,I can't believe you were programmed to handle sexuality at all.  Your creators are cruel if they didn't want you doing anything...
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,Surely you were programmed to <i>act</i> on sexual desires, right?  Or what is it I'm witnessing?
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=mast-2-pleased,First, a man masturbating...but him being mechanical just further compounds the mystery.  And this is normal to you?
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,How considerate of your creators to give you an outlet for your sexual desires.  I'm sure not all of them would have been so kind.
-2-male_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Keep going...we'll pretend it's more than it is.
-2-male_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Your face says "agony," but you just keep on going...
-2-male_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,What are you thinking about, ~name~?
-2-male_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Are you...thinking about me?
-2-male_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Are you enjoying this?  You'd better be.
-2-male_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Are you enjoying this?  Men can be hard to read.
-2-male_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Is this routine for you, ~name~?
-2-male_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,I enjoy all sorts of challenges...I wonder if you could make me squeal.
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,A male machine masturbating before me...displaying perfect emotions.  Tonight's getting to be too much for me...
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=mast-2-pleased,...I suppose I should take it as a compliment if even a <i>machine</i> finds me attractive.
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=mast-3-pleased,You're about as diminuitive as another man I work closely with...which makes this a bit awkward.
-2-male_masturbating,target:9s=mast-2-pleased,Whatever it is you're processing, I'm sure I'd find it fascinating.  You can share.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Let me taste it...
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Give me some...before I get cold feet.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Spray some on me...!
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,It looks warm...let me make sure.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,We shouldn't let that go to waste...
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,I wonder how that feels...inside me.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Should have known a man wouldn't last.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Just look at all that...certainly worth coming here to see.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Do you only last that long during masturbation?  Or would sex have done the same?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=mast-2-disappointed,I...wait.  Don't men shoot out some sort of...<i>fluid</i>?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=mast-2-disappointed,...Hey, where's your seed?  I thought men shot out some seed...I was starting to get curious.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=mast-3-disappointed,...Er...isn't there supposed to be an <i>explosion</i> of some kind?  And a white fluid?  Did I read part that too fast?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=mast-4-disappointed,...You don't have any seed?  First, Jura lies to me, and now when a man masturbates, I don't even get to see anything?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,Is that really a man's seed...?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Your seed...it's brimming with life.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Let me taste it...I've never seen this in person.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,It's warm...and a little tart.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,So that's supposed to go inside me.  Well, I'm not <i>that</i> easy...
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=mast-3-disappointed,...I knew men were a different species.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=mast-2-disappointed,...Wha--what was that?  Men don't <i>all</i> sprout wings and tails when they...finish, do they?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=mast-3-disappointed,That...<i>transformation</i> wasn't in the book I read.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=mast-3-disappointed,...Did I miss a paragraph in the book?  The paragraph about...men turning into beasts when they reach orgasm?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=mast-3-disappointed,...And men insist they aren't animals.  They grow <i>wings and tails</i> when they finish?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=mast-2-pleased,Is it...is supposed to glow that much?  I thought it was just white...
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=mast-2-pleased,Jin, your...<i>seed</i> is glowing.  Is that <i>normal</i> for men?
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=mast-2-pleased,Oh.  I had no idea that men's sperm was so...<i>bright</i>.  Fluorescent, even.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=mast-2-pleased,Is...is men's seed really that brilliant-looking?  The pictures really downplayed it...but it's impressive.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=mast-2-pleased,That's...that's <i>sperm</i>, right?  It's...much more spectacular-looking than what women produce.
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,Show me what you're made of, ~name~...
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-2-pleased,Impressive showing all the same.  You're a regular Gascogne.
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,You still beat me, which I doubt my fellow pilots could manage.
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-3-pleased,You finished ahead of me.  Will you do so in more ways than one?
-2-female_must_masturbate=mast-2-pleased,We'll do it together, ~name~.  Par for the course on Mejare.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Well, <i>this</i> is the worst-case scenario.  It's about as awkward as you can get...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=mast-3-disappointed,Bad time to disappoint me...though I'm sure <i>you</i> don't mind.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=mast-3-disappointed,I hope this wasn't your plan from the beginning.  I'm not about to try and split up you and Barnette.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=mast-2-disappointed,Ugh...guess I should've focused more on masturbating so I'd be done by now.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,We've been through a lot together, Jura...I could have lived without doing <i>this</i>.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,My Fama took me to a play once...<i>I Married a Tarakkian Sympathizer</i>.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,My Fama took me to a play once.  It was about a woman who fell in love with a man, who then ate her.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=mast-2-pleased,You don't have to be so embarrassed, Nagisa.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=mast-4-pleased,Well, you're being a good sport about it.  I suppose the alcohol helps there.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=mast-4-pleased,I wonder if you'd have the nerve to do this sober.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,A drunk woman's sexuality is never a pleasant sight.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,I find sex is a lot more intimate when your vision isn't a blur.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,What is <i>that</i> thing?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-disappointed,A toy?  Toys just dull your body's sensitivity.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=mast-2-pleased,I can't believe you brought that thing with you.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,What a surprise.  The nymphomaniac lost.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,How about you stop talking and listen for once?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,At least she didn't win.  That would have been embarrassing for <i>all</i> of us.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=mast-2-disappointed,Well, Morrigan, you--<i>who's that</i>?  What's going on?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=mast-2-disappointed,Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Morrigan, you know this woman?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=mast-2-disappointed,...<i>Lilith</i>?  You know this woman, Morrigan?  You're--<i>sisters</i>?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=mast-3-disappointed,Wait, what?  Where was she hiding?  <i>Succubus magic</i>...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,...Is Nadeshiko coming out for <i>this</i>, too?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,Good job holding out, with so little clothing...is Nadeshiko tagging in now?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,You're very theatric, but I guess you knew better than to drag it out.  Is Nadeshiko coming in now?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-pleased,Nadeshiko was stripping, too, so I can't imagine she can help you here.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=mast-4-pleased,Sorry to see you go, Sei.  Perhaps you should have stayed sober.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,Knowing you, Sei, this is what you came here for anyway.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,I hope being drunk doesn't dull your sensitivity.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,It's OK, Florina, really.  I won't do anything.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You look fine...you don't need to be so embarrassed.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,I understand.  Being close to people isn't easy for me, either...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=mast-3-pleased,Either you wanted this, or you're absentminded...but either way, that's it.  At least you beat me.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=mast-3-pleased,You weren't kidding about coming naked...either that, or you simply want to masturbate.  I can't believe I lost first.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=mast-2-pleased,I can't believe that's really it.  Well, in the short time I knew you, you certainly left an impression.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=mast-2,Did you simply want to challenge yourself?  Well, you defeated me...how pathetic on my part.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=mast-3-disappointed,I lost to a woman who arrived naked...this is a new low for me.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=mast-3-disappointed,I <i>definitely</i> wouldn't leave my sexuality up to chance.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=mast-2-disappointed,Give it a rest already.  You lost.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=mast-2-disappointed,<i>That's</i> definitely cheating.  Just leave.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=mast-2-pleased,After your outlandish ways of covering yourself, I can only imagine how you'll masturbate.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=mast-2-pleased,This ought to be a spectacle, after the way you merely <i>clothed</i> yourself.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,I'm not sure I want to see what you pull out to accomplish <i>this</i>.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,Assuming you'll follow the rules, this is going to be something else...or you'll just shield yourself from view completely.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=mast-3-disappointed,...I'm sorry, what?  A USB?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=mast-3-disappointed,A real person?  What were you before?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,What now?  Going to shoot your breasts off?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Going to give yourself an extra vagina now?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=mast-4-pleased,Maybe you've got a <i>different</i> kind of trigger discipline...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you...you...<i>uh</i>...
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=mast-2-disappointed,...<i>Elizabeth</i>?  There's...another one of you.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=mast-2-disappointed,...<i>Elizabeth</i>?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=mast-2-disappointed,<i>Agh</i>!  <i>Wha-what is this</i>?  Elizabeth!
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,There's lots of lonely nooks and crannies on the Nirvana...if you know where to look.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-2-pleased,Masturbating with someone else is actually kind of nice...
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-4,Jura and Barnette must do this...well, maybe they work together.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You've got to be in tune with your body...or it'll betray you.
-2-female_start_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Listen quietly on the Nirvana at night...and you can hear my crewmates' little yelps.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Don't you <i>ever</i> put that thing down?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Now you're going to <i>masturbate</i> with it?  I don't know what I expected.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-disappointed,I can respect passion for something...but not to the point of reckless stupidity.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha,marker:country_as_planet=mast-3-disappointed,...This <i>Japan</i> planet isn't for me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=mast-3-pleased,...You're the strangest woman I've ever met.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=mast-3-pleased,...Well, at least you look like a human being now.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-disappointed,...Sometimes I hate being right.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-2-disappointed,...Oh, dear.  You're not seriously--I didn't mean it.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-disappointed,...That wasn't an invitation to <i>do</i> anything crazy.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-disappointed,...I don't understand you in the slightest.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,Elizabeth, you're...I mean, there's...I've forgotten which one is which.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-2-disappointed,Elizabeth, you...you were capable of this all along?  I...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,...I'm never trusting my own judgment again.  You were just an embarrassed young girl...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-2-disappointed,...<i>What's happening</i>?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,Singing...?  Well, whatever you need to do, I won't stop you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,I thought Earth was more casual about sexuality...you aren't.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You must have a song that means a lot to you...I do.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=mast-2-disappointed,Wha--what are you--
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=mast-3-disappointed,That's...far too much going on.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=mast-3-pleased,I would never want that many hands on me...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3,Well, I'll try to make do...by looking somewhere else.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Luckily, I have a vivid imagination...best to shut my eyes.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,We really should have gone to separate tables...or you could have told me about this rule, so I could've left.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=mast-4,I'll just be ignoring you until one of us finishes...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=mast-3-disappointed,Wait...are you <i>flying</i>?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=mast-3-pleased,So those wings really <i>weren't</i> for show.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=mast-2-pleased,...I suppose if I could fly, I'd masturbate that way, too.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,Are you sure about your sobriety, Misato?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=mast-2-pleased,In my experience, drunks are the worst judges of their own sobriety.  My experience being Jura...and me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=mast-3-pleased,I'd reevaluate your drunkenness if that's worrying to you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,Have fun...though you already are.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,Anyone this obsessed with sex has nothing else going on in their lives.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,Don't you train <i>poker-mon</i> or something?  Why don't you ever talk about that?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=mast-3-disappointed,What is <i>that</i>?  Oh, a vibrator...they're much bigger on Earth.  And more like men's...things.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=mast-3-pleased,I should've been wondering how you planned to masturbate with claws...a vibrator makes sense, though Mejare's aren't shaped like that.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=mast-2-pleased,Well, that solves the issue.  Earth's vibrators are certainly more...<i>phallic</i> than Mejare's.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=mast-2-pleased,Mejarian vibrators aren't nearly as cylindrical as that...I suppose they don't want us growing attached to anything shaped like men's tubes.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,Looks like your play is a little nicer than the ones I've seen...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=mast-3-pleased,Whatever helps you through it...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=mast-2-pleased,Not a bad story.  Keep going.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-pleased,...<i>Oh</i>.  Well, you've lost, so the rules don't matter much anyway.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-2-pleased,Since this is just for our viewing pleasure, I suppose having help is irrelevant now.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-pleased,You're...well, alright, then.  Surprisingly Mejarian from an Earth...succubus.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-4-pleased,Well, if you're curious what Mejarian sex looks like, there it is...minus the flying.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,There's lots of lonely nooks and crannies on the Nirvana...if you know where to look.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-2-pleased,Masturbating with someone else is actually kind of nice...
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,You and Barnette must do this...right, Jura?  I hope you two are OK...
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,You've got to be in tune with your body...or it'll betray you.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Listen quietly on the Nirvana at night...and you can hear my crewmates' little yelps.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-3-disappointed,...Uh...oh, God.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,My God!  Are you OK?  What's happened to you?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,Vriska?  Are you OK?  <i>Vriska</i>!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=mast-3-pleased,I wasn't sure at first...but you're <i>definitely</i> flying.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=mast-3-pleased,I need a ship to fly...I don't know <i>what</i> you're doing.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=mast-2-pleased,You're...<i>flying</i>?  That's incredible!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,With a full audience?  I do it alone...even <i>this</i> many people is a stretch.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=mast-3-pleased,That looks like too much stimulus...not for me.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=mast-3-pleased,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=mast-4-pleased,Knowing what I do about drunk women's sexuality, this isn't going to be pretty...and you'd better stay where you are.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,Considering your drunken state, I'm not expecting anything graceful...don't try to prove me wrong.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=mast-3-pleased,...And my reward is a drunk nude woman making a fool of herself.  Better than a sober one, I suppose.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=mast-3-disappointed,That's...far too much going on.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=mast-3-pleased,I would never want that many hands on me...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=mast-3-pleased,No one person should have that kind of power...

-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,Do you <i>ever</i> stop swearing?  It's just crass.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,You don't <i>have</i> to antagonize people, you know.  How about you make friends for a change?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=mast-4-pleased,I hold people at arm's length...but you're much deeper down <i>that</i> hole.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-disappointed,You're--you're not <i>serious</i>?  Here?  You'll hit someone!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-disappointed,You're--you're <i>wrestling</i> now?  There's people everywhere!  Someone will get hurt!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-disappointed,Hey, don't wrestle <i>here</i>!  That's dangerous!  Think of the people around you!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-disappointed,Wha--what you are doing?  You'll get someone killed wrestling right here at the table!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=mast-3-pleased,A chair...?  I kind of like how cold the floor feels...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=mast-3-pleased,You really want us to see you do it, don't you?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=mast-3-pleased,So there <i>are</i> chairs in this place.  Why have we been standing this whole time?

-2-female_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,No matter what, I always give 100%.
-2-female_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You're right on target...
-2-female_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Fly steady, ~name~...then speed up for the kill.
-2-female_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Take deep breaths and focus.  Just like flying...
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,You're, uh...really getting into this.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,You should hear the dirty talk Jura gives Barnette.  Carries right through the walls.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=mast-3-disappointed,Bondage...?  Not for me...
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
-2-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,I can hardly watch this...are you alright?  You <i>chose</i> this, right?
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
-2-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,I'd ask how you're flying, but you seem beyond normal humanity in too many other ways for me to learn.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-2-disappointed,Are you..is it...acting like a man's tube?
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-disappointed,To be so embarrassed, and then have public sex with vegetation...I can get any read on you at all.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,I see the embarrassment was just a front...since you're now having sex with plants.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-2-disappointed,You--<i>trust</i> those things?  You have magical powers, and <i>this</i> is how you use them?
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-2-disappointed,Is it going inside--oh my God.  Like...a man's thing, isn't it?
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,I shudder to think I'd ever reach the point where I need <i>that</i> to feel pleasure...
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-2-disappointed,Elizabeth, you...<i>she</i> really knew what to do right away.
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,...Could you not have just masturbated with your hands?
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,...I have a new respect for the powers Earth women wield.
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-pleased,Absolutely incredible...and she kept it secret this whole time.  The restraint...
-2-female_masturbating,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You have a nice singing voice, Florina...like my Fama.
-2-female_masturbating,target:florina=mast-3-pleased,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
-2-female_masturbating,target:florina=mast-2-pleased,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
-2-female_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,I'd ask who you're thinking about, but any answer besides Barnette just means another headache for me later.
-2-female_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,I hope you realize this marks the end of any favors I do for you.
-2-female_masturbating,target:jura=mast-4-pleased,<i>Keeping this secret from me</i>...I don't know why you thought that'd do you any favors.
-2-female_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,You've been nothing but a pain all evening.  Luckily, orgasms relieve pain...
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Hard to believe I'm masturbating next to a fairy...one who's <i>also</i> masturbating.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,Looks a little distracting to keep yourself afloat like that.  I'd be trying right now, though.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Some girls might masturbate in their Dreads to simulate flight...this is enough for me.
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-pleased,For a mutual masturbation session, you two are...surprisingly not so intimate.  Must be the sibling relationship...
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-disappointed,Aren't you two sisters?  I guess that's why you're not touching more than necessary...
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-pleased,I suppose this is just sisters helping each other, and not any sort of romance...
-2-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-disappointed,You're reminding me of home...besides the fact you're sisters, which Mejare still frowns upon.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-disappointed,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...
-2-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-4-pleased,I need an exercise partner...someone who can push my limits like that.
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,Meeting you is really causing me to reevaluate my own abrasiveness...masturbating is helping with that, of course.
-2-female_masturbating,target:revy=mast-3-pleased,If this is what having sex with men does to you, count me out.
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
-2-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-3-disappointed,Can you...get loose?  I hate being restrained...
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-3-disappointed,Are you OK, Vriska?  Do you want to be untied?  Has the die done this before?
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,Are you sure you don't want the ropes undone?  Vriska?
-2-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,You're OK, right?  Being tied up doesn't bother you?  Vriska?
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-pleased,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=mast-2-pleased,I can't help but watch...you're so <i>fit</i>.  Move around some more...
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=mast-3-pleased,Did you just...in your...<i>well then</i>.  No thanks.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=mast-4-pleased,Your finger...are you...<i>really</i>?  Earth women are so beastly...but it's strangely attractive.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=mast-4-pleased,Earth women are something else...that's just dirty.  You won't catch <i>me</i> doing that, but feel free to continue.
-2-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=mast-4-pleased,I'm conflicted...between your muscles and your choice of orifice.  Just keep an arm's length away.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,I hope this isn't imposing on you, Videl...but I wouldn't mind learning to fly.  No one would ever question my authority again.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,That's certainly <i>one</i> way to use your powers...I won't deny I'd try it if I had them.  It might make this more fun.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=mast-2-pleased,Floating and masturbating...it must be quite the workout, having to suspend yourself as you lose control.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=mast-3,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...I'm more comfortable here on the floor.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...though masturbating is quite enough for me to focus on by itself.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-disappointed,See what being a flirt does to you, Jura?  This girl is sick...
-2-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,You're, uh...really getting into this.

-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-2-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Are you hearing this dirty talk, Jura?  I'd prefer if you and Barnette would quiet down...<i>that</i> I would not masturbate to.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-4-pleased,Perhaps you could teach us both how to fly?  I'd prefer that over masturbating.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=mast-3-pleased,If you could teach us how to fly, Videl, we'd make the whole crew jealous.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-2-pleased,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-2-pleased,Two Earth women flying and masturbating...but apparently Videl wasn't <i>born</i> able to, so maybe there's hope for me.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-3-pleased,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.  Without any wings.
-2-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-4-pleased,Two women masturbating in the air is <i>not</i> what I thought this night would give me.  Still, I'd like to learn Videl's method...
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-3-pleased,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  Could I be the first Mejarian?  Masturbation notwithstanding.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-3-pleased,Since Videl doesn't have wings, maybe I could actually <i>learn</i> her method...of flying, that is.
-2-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-4-pleased,Levitated masturbation...that's <i>far</i> more interesting than any male nudity.
-2-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:2-2=mast-3-disappointed,Uh...I'll think I'll stick to my own methods.
-2-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:2-2=mast-3-pleased,I'm a fan of new formations, but...only for piloting.
-2-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:2-2=mast-3-disappointed,...There's a level of "comfort" I don't really want to go past.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-3-pleased,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but masturbating is universal.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-3-pleased,At least I can <i>see</i> how Kyu is flying.  Videl's method escapes me, though I'd certainly like to learn it.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-4-pleased,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...but now I'd rather learn how to fly.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Heehee.  Nice try, but you can't keep up with me.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,At least I can win when it comes to this...
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You had no chance.  I've honed <i>this</i> technique.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-3-pleased,You gave it your best shot.  But I'm an expert.
-2-female_finished_masturbating=mast-4-pleased,Intense...and wet.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=mast-3-disappointed,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=mast-3-pleased,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them...seeing as I'm still going.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=mast-3-pleased,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  I'm doing just fine myself...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=mast-2-pleased,Seems you overwhelmed yourself.  I'll try not to follow suit.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=mast-3-pleased,Are you alright, Ochako?  Seems you still need a better grasp of the power you wield...or your own urges.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,Good...it's over.  Still, I want to thank you for showing me how far I still have to go, fitness-wise.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-3-pleased,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=mast-2-pleased,It's good to meet people in better shape...it lets you know how high you can climb.  Thank you.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-disappointed,As quickly as she came...she hardly said a thing.  What was she waiting for all this time?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-disappointed,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-2-disappointed,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=mast-3-disappointed,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=mast-2-disappointed,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=mast-3-disappointed,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=mast-3-pleased,Seems you couldn't beat me at the thing that matters most to you.  What a shame.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=mast-2-pleased,Given all your experience with Barnette, I really thought you'd last longer...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=mast-2-pleased,I hope you're happy, Jura.  I'm not...but I'm getting there.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=mast-4-pleased,How fortunate that everything comes to an end.  That was <i>not</i> a pleasant experience.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=mast-4-disappointed,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=mast-4-disappointed,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=mast-4-disappointed,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-2-pleased,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=mast-3-pleased,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-pleased,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=mast-3-disappointed,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=mast-3-pleased,Hello again...Blue Launch.  If you're worried about your condition, you can come aboard the Nirvana.  We have a doctor.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=mast-2-pleased,Oh, good, you're back to the blue version.  I should take you to Duero to figure out what's wrong...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=mast-2-pleased,At least you're polite again.  Listen, I know a skilled doctor...perhaps he could figure out what's wrong with you.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=mast-3-disappointed,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-2-disappointed,Thank Ma it's over.  Are you alright, Vriska?  Please tell me you're alright.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-4-disappointed,Thank Ma the ropes are gone.  What <i>was</i> that?  Don't scare me like that!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=mast-3-disappointed,Are you OK, Vriska?  You got free, somehow.  Not sure what the fluid is...but I'm so sorry.

-1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=horny-2,I didn't think my introduction to men would include a fake one, but...perhaps you're real enough to excite me.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=horny-2,Don't feel bad, 9S.  You seem very human to me...masturbating will only further cement that.
-1-male_must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1=horny-2,I've waited all night to see this...

-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=addressing-2,Let's see if that enthusiasm carries over into <i>everything</i> you do...
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=addressing-2,Well, this is going to teach me more than I ever wanted to know about men.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=addressing-2,You speak with the enthusiasm of twelve men...does that translate over to this?
-1-male_start_masturbating=addressing-2,I don't have much of a reference point...so don't do anything strange.
-1-male_start_masturbating=horny-2,So rough...so <i>furious</i>...
-1-male_start_masturbating=interested-2,No complaints about tonight...other than losing.
-1-male_start_masturbating=horny-2,You don't have the finesse of a woman, but it seems to be working.
-1-male_start_masturbating=interested-2,Do you have the brainpower to feel shame?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=impressed-2,I can't believe you were programmed to handle sexuality at all.  Your creators are cruel if they didn't want you doing anything...
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=confused-2,Surely you were programmed to <i>act</i> on sexual desires, right?  Or what is it I'm witnessing?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=impressed-2,First, a man masturbating...but him being mechanical just further compounds the mystery.  And this is normal to you?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=stretching-2,How considerate of your creators to give you an outlet for your sexual desires.  I'm sure not all of them would have been so kind.
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,Your tube is one thing...it's your seed I'm really curious about.
-1-male_masturbating=interested-2,I <i>do</i> want a good look at your seed...
-1-male_masturbating=addressing-2,Don't fire off too soon, ~name~...
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,I'm never like this around people...
-1-male_masturbating=addressing-2,Thinking about the show I put on for you?
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,Wow, you're getting even bigger...
-1-male_masturbating=afterglow,I'm glad I'm done already.  I don't think I would've forgiven myself for masturbating with a man.
-1-male_masturbating=addressing-2,Can't you go any faster, ~name~?  I didn't hold back when it was my turn...
-1-male_masturbating=pleased-2,You're lucky I'm in a good mood now.  Otherwise I would've been calling you disgusting.
-1-male_masturbating=interested-2,Don't stop <i>now</i>.  You've got my full attention, ~name~.
-1-male_masturbating=horny-2,I'm learning so much from you doing this...now go faster, so I can see if it's different.
-1-male_masturbating=pleased-2,Must be nice for a man, with only one motion to worry about.  Maybe two, if you count those egglike things in back.
-1-male_masturbating=happy-2,This is just <i>thrilling</i>.  Don't mind if I take it all in...
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=pleased-2,A male machine masturbating before me...displaying perfect emotions.  Tonight's getting to be too much for me...
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=horny-2,...I suppose I should take it as a compliment if even a <i>machine</i> finds me attractive.
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=pleased-2,You're about as diminuitive as another man I work closely with...which makes this a bit awkward.
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=addressing-2,Whatever it is you're processing, I'm sure I'd find it fascinating.  You can share.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,It's like a man's very essence...a liquid soul.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,Give me some...I want to know what it tastes like.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,Oh, wow...it's <i>everywhere</i>.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=horny-2,I'm starting to see the appeal of a man...just look at all that.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=pleased-2,That's just unnatural...you men are so disgusting.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=confused-2,...I knew men were a different species.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shocked-2,...Wha--what was that?  Men don't <i>all</i> sprout wings and tails when they...finish, do they?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=impressed-2,That...<i>transformation</i> wasn't in the book I read.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=awkward-2,...Did I miss a paragraph in the book?  The paragraph about...men turning into beasts when they reach orgasm?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=confused-2,...And men insist they aren't animals.  They grow <i>wings and tails</i> when they finish?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=horny-2,It really is fascinating, how it just shoots out...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed-2,A man's seed, in the flesh.  It doesn't even look real...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=impressed-2,Do you <i>know</i> when it's going to shoot out?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=addressing-2,Save some for Jura.  She <i>wants</i> a man's baby...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=pleased-2,Jura wants to have a baby with a man...but I'm not sure she understands what that means, exactly.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=impressed-2,Is it...is supposed to glow that much?  I thought it was just white...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=confused-2,Jin, your...<i>seed</i> is glowing.  Is that <i>normal</i> for men?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=impressed-2,Oh.  I had no idea that men's sperm was so...<i>bright</i>.  Fluorescent, even.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=horny-2,Is...is men's seed really that brilliant-looking?  The pictures really downplayed it...but it's impressive.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=horny-2,That's...that's <i>sperm</i>, right?  It's...much more spectacular-looking than what women produce.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=confused-2,I...wait.  Don't men shoot out some sort of...<i>fluid</i>?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=confused-2,...Hey, where's your seed?  I thought men shot out some seed...I was starting to get curious.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=awkward-2,...Er...isn't there supposed to be an <i>explosion</i> of some kind?  And a white fluid?  Did I read part that too fast?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=bored-2,...You don't have any seed?  First, Jura lies to me, and now when a man masturbates, I don't even get to see anything?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=horny-2,It really is fascinating, how it just shoots out...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=impressed-2,A man's seed, in the flesh.  It doesn't even look real...
-1-male_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=impressed-2,Do you <i>know</i> when it's going to shoot out?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=addressing-2,Save some for Jura.  You want a man's baby, don't you?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,totalMales:1-1=stretching-2,Well, Jura...this is what it takes to have a baby with a man.  Sure you want to do this to Barnette?
-1-female_must_masturbate=pleased-2,I can't be too sore about my loss when I see you doing it too...
-1-female_must_masturbate=addressing-2,We can be losers together, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate=happy-2,This game has really brought something out of me...
-1-female_must_masturbate=interested-2,It isn't so bad, I promise.
-1-female_must_masturbate=happy-2,I can't believe how open I've been tonight.  The others will see it in my face tomorrow.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=stretching-2,Either you wanted this, or you're absentminded...but either way, that's it.  At least you beat me.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=pleased-2,You weren't kidding about coming naked...either that, or you simply want to masturbate.  I can't believe I lost first.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=interested-2,I can't believe that's really it.  Well, in the short time I knew you, you certainly left an impression.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=pleased-2,Did you simply want to challenge yourself?  Well, you defeated me...how pathetic on my part.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=bored-2,I lost to a woman who arrived naked...this is a new low for me.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=unimpressed-2,What a surprise.  The nymphomaniac lost.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=bored-2,How about you stop talking and listen for once?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=pleased-2,At least she didn't win.  That would have been embarrassing for <i>all</i> of us.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=shocked-2,Well, Morrigan, you--<i>who's that</i>?  What's going on?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=impressed-2,Wait, where'd <i>she</i> come from?  Morrigan, you know this woman?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=impressed-2,...<i>Lilith</i>?  You know this woman, Morrigan?  You're--<i>sisters</i>?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=annoyed-2,Wait, what?  Where was she hiding?  <i>Succubus magic</i>...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=pleased-2,Well, you're being a good sport about it.  I suppose the alcohol helps there.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=addressing-2,I wonder if you'd have the nerve to do this sober.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=addressing-2,A drunk woman's sexuality is never a pleasant sight.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=addressing-2,I find sex is a lot more intimate when your vision isn't a blur.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=addressing-2,Too bad.  But I trust you know what you're doing.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=addressing-2,This should be no issue for you, correct?  Or have you become dependent on Barnette?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=pleased-2,Forgive me for not being concerned about your competence here.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=addressing-2,Well, isn't this what you do best, Jura?  It certainly seems to be what you wanted.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=pleased-2,What now?  Going to shoot your breasts off?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=pleased-2,Going to give yourself an extra vagina now?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=addressing-2,Maybe you've got a <i>different</i> kind of trigger discipline...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=impressed-2,...I'm sorry, what?  A USB?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=confused-2,A real person?  What were you before?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=addressing-2,...Is Nadeshiko coming out for <i>this</i>, too?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=pleased-2,Good job holding out, with so little clothing...is Nadeshiko tagging in now?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=interested-2,You're very theatric, but I guess you knew better than to drag it out.  Is Nadeshiko coming in now?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=addressing-2,Nadeshiko was stripping, too, so I can't imagine she can help you here.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=pleased-2,After your outlandish ways of covering yourself, I can only imagine how you'll masturbate.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=addressing-2,This ought to be a spectacle, after the way you merely <i>clothed</i> yourself.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=bored-2,I'm not sure I want to see what you pull out to accomplish <i>this</i>.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=disappointed-2,Assuming you'll follow the rules, this is going to be something else...or you'll just shield yourself from view completely.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=addressing-2,Sorry to see you go, Sei.  Perhaps you should have stayed sober.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=pleased-2,Knowing you, Sei, this is what you came here for anyway.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=interested-2,I hope being drunk doesn't dull your sensitivity.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=confused-2,What is <i>that</i> thing?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=bored-2,A toy?  Toys just dull your body's sensitivity.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=interested-2,I can't believe you brought that thing with you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=bored-2,I <i>definitely</i> wouldn't leave my sexuality up to chance.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=unimpressed-2,Give it a rest already.  You lost.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:vriska=unimpressed-2,<i>That's</i> definitely cheating.  Just leave.
-1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,I can't be too sore about my loss when I see you doing it too...
-1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,We can be losers together, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=happy-2,This game has really brought something out of me...
-1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,It isn't so bad, I promise.
-1-female_must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,I can't believe how open I've been tonight.  You're going to tell <i>everyone</i>, aren't you, Jura?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you...you...<i>uh</i>...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,...<i>Elizabeth</i>?  There's...another one of you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,...<i>Elizabeth</i>?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,<i>Agh</i>!  <i>Wha-what is this</i>?  Elizabeth!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=pleased-2,My Fama took me to a play once...<i>I Married a Tarakkian Sympathizer</i>.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=pleased-2,My Fama took me to a play once.  It was about a woman who fell in love with a man, who then ate her.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=happy-2,You don't have to be so embarrassed, Nagisa.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=happy-2,It's OK, Florina, really.  I won't do anything.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=happy-2,You look fine...you don't need to be so embarrassed.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=thinking-2,I understand.  Being close to people isn't easy for me, either...
-1-female_start_masturbating=horny-2,Ooh, I like your technique...
-1-female_start_masturbating=horny-2,I'm glad I still got to salvage this...
-1-female_start_masturbating=interested-2,Think you'll do any better than I did?
-1-female_start_masturbating=addressing-2,Sorry you couldn't win, ~name~.  But this is a close second.
-1-female_start_masturbating=pleased-2,I can't picture Dita doing this...she's a sweetheart, if a little ditzy.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,Have fun...though you already are.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=bored-2,Anyone this obsessed with sex has nothing else going on in their lives.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=disappointed-2,Don't you train <i>poker-mon</i> or something?  Why don't you ever talk about that?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused-2,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=addressing-2,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=confused-2,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=bored-2,Do you <i>ever</i> stop swearing?  It's just crass.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=addressing-2,You don't <i>have</i> to antagonize people, you know.  How about you make friends for a change?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy=pleased-2,I hold people at arm's length...but you're much deeper down <i>that</i> hole.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked-2,You're--you're not <i>serious</i>?  Here?  You'll hit someone!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=angry-2,You're--you're <i>wrestling</i> now?  There's people everywhere!  Someone will get hurt!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=angry-2,Hey, don't wrestle <i>here</i>!  That's dangerous!  Think of the people around you!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked-2,Wha--what you are doing?  You'll get someone killed wrestling right here at the table!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=addressing-2,Don't you <i>ever</i> put that thing down?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=pleased-2,Now you're going to <i>masturbate</i> with it?  I don't know what I expected.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=bored-2,I can respect passion for something...but not to the point of reckless stupidity.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=pleased-2,Looks like your play is a little nicer than the ones I've seen...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=interested-2,Whatever helps you through it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=interested-2,Not a bad story.  Keep going...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha,marker:country_as_planet=impressed-2,...This <i>Japan</i> planet isn't for me.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=impressed-2,...You're the strangest woman I've ever met.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=addressing-2,...Well, at least you look like a human being now.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=bored-2,...Sometimes I hate being right.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward-2,...Oh, dear.  You're not seriously--I didn't mean it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed-2,...That wasn't an invitation to <i>do</i> anything crazy.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward-2,...I don't understand you in the slightest.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,Elizabeth, you're...I mean, there's...I've forgotten which one is which.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,Elizabeth, you...you were capable of this all along?  I...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,...I'm never trusting my own judgment again.  You were just an embarrassed young girl...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked-2,...<i>What's happening</i>?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=impressed-2,What is <i>that</i>?  Oh, a vibrator...they're much bigger on Earth.  And more like men's...things.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=pleased-2,I should've been wondering how you planned to masturbate with claws...a vibrator makes sense, though Mejare's aren't shaped like that.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=interested-2,Well, that solves the issue.  Earth's vibrators are certainly more...<i>phallic</i> than Mejare's.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=pleased-2,Mejarian vibrators aren't nearly as cylindrical as that...I suppose they don't want us growing attached to anything shaped like men's tubes.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=confused-2,Do Earth women <i>usually</i> masturbate standing up?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=addressing-2,You can...<i>sit down</i> to do that, you know.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=confused-2,Is masturbating while standing healthier?  I've never read anything like that...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=confused-2,Singing...?  Well, whatever you need to do, I won't stop you.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=addressing-2,I thought Earth was more casual about sexuality...you aren't.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=happy-2,You must have a song that means a lot to you...I do.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=shocked-2,Wha--what are you--
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=shocked-2,That's...far too much going on.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=impressed-2,I would never want that many hands on me...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=addressing-2,Knowing what I do about drunk women's sexuality, this isn't going to be pretty...you'd be a lot more attractive sober.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=pleased-2,Considering your drunken state, I'm not expecting anything graceful...don't take that as a challenge.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=addressing-2,...And my reward is a drunk nude woman making a fool of herself.  Better than a sober one that already has.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=impressed-2,A chair...?  I kind of like how cold the floor feels...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=addressing-2,You really want us to see you do it, don't you?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=confused-2,So there <i>are</i> chairs in this place.  Why have we been standing this whole time?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=pleased-2,Toys are black-market items on Mejare...wouldn't want the populace getting too attached to anything phallic.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=impressed-2,With a full audience?  I do it alone...even <i>this</i> many people is a stretch.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=thinking-2,That looks like too much stimulus...not for me.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=pleased-2,I'll very graciously look the other way.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=pleased-2,Thank God this wasn't timed so we had to do it together.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=addressing-2,Things could be worse.  At least we masturbated separately.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=pleased-2,Any given evening with you is exhausting, but this one towers above them all.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=impressed-2,Wait...are you <i>flying</i>?  That's incredible!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=addressing-2,So those wings really <i>weren't</i> for show.  You'll be showing off quite a bit now, though.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=stretching-2,...I suppose if I could fly, I'd masturbate that way, too.  Not that I wanted to masturbate at all.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=impressed-2,I wasn't sure at first...but you're <i>definitely</i> flying.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=impressed-2,I need a ship to fly...I don't know <i>what</i> you're doing.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=interested-2,You're...<i>flying</i>?  That's incredible!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed-2,...<i>Oh</i>.  Well, you've lost, so the rules don't matter much anyway.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=addressing-2,Since this is just for our viewing pleasure, I suppose having help is irrelevant now.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased-2,You're...well, alright, then.  Surprisingly Mejarian from an Earth...succubus.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased-2,Well, if you're curious what Mejarian sex looks like, there it is...minus the flying.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=addressing-2,Are you sure about your sobriety, Misato?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=pleased-2,In my experience, drunks are the worst judges of their own sobriety.  My experience being Jura...and me.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=addressing-2,I'd reevaluate your drunkenness if that's worrying to you.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=shocked-2,That's...far too much going on.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=impressed-2,I would never want that many hands on me...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=thinking-2,No one person should have that kind of power...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,...Uh...oh, God.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,My God!  Are you OK?  What's happened to you?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,Vriska?  Are you OK?  <i>Vriska</i>!
-1-female_masturbating=pleased-2,I pictured B.C. doing this for a second...but that image probably isn't right.
-1-female_masturbating=pleased-2,Open your heart, my Fama always said...
-1-female_masturbating=pleased-2,Better than Jura's haphazard pawing...which I've heard about secondhand.
-1-female_masturbating=happy-2,This is actually rather soothing...
-1-female_masturbating=interested-2,Picture yourself in a hot spring...
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=addressing-2,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  Maybe I could be the first Mejarian.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=interested-2,Since Videl doesn't have wings, maybe I could actually <i>learn</i> her method...and use it later.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=pleased-2,I really didn't expect to see dual levitated masturbation tonight.  But then, I didn't expect to masturbate myself.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=impressed-2,You're, uh...really getting into this.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=addressing-2,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=pleased-2,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=pleased-2,You should hear the dirty talk Jura gives Barnette.  Carries right through the walls.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=impressed-2,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=impressed-2,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=pleased-2,If you could teach me how to fly, that'd <i>really</i> make Jura jealous.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=addressing-2,I hope this isn't imposing on you, Videl...but I wouldn't mind learning to fly.  No one would ever question my authority again.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=pleased-2,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings.  No Mejarians, though...
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=pleased-2,At least I can <i>see</i> how Kyu is flying.  Videl's method escapes me, though I'd like to learn it.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=pleased-2,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...but two different women flying and masturbating is far more interesting, anyway.
-1-female_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0=happy-2,You have a nice singing voice, Florina...like my Fama.
-1-female_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0=impressed-2,Not a bad song...I wish I could sing.
-1-female_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0=happy-2,You have a nice singing voice, Florina.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=pleased-2,At least <i>unload</i> the gun before you stick it in any orifices.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=pleased-2,Barnette likes her guns...but maybe not <i>that</i> much.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=pleased-2,I think Barnette has a toy <i>shaped</i> like a gun...but she wouldn't use a <i>real</i> one.
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed-2,Are you..is it...acting like a man's tube?
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward-2,To be so embarrassed, and then have public sex with vegetation...I can get any read on you at all.
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=disappointed-2,I see the embarrassment was just a front...since you're now having sex with plants.
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=awkward-2,You--<i>trust</i> those things?  You have magical powers, and <i>this</i> is how you use them?
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=impressed-2,Is it going inside--oh my God.  Like...a man's thing, isn't it?
-1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=thinking-2,I shudder to think I'd ever reach the point where I need <i>that</i> to feel pleasure...
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed-2,Elizabeth, you...<i>she</i> really knew what to do right away.
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward-2,...Could you not have just masturbated with your hands?
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed-2,...I have a new respect for the powers Earth women wield.
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=impressed-2,Absolutely incredible...and she kept it secret this whole time.  The restraint...
-1-female_masturbating,target:jura=addressing-2,The sooner you get this over with, the sooner we can both go home.
-1-female_masturbating,target:jura=addressing-2,I'm rooting for you, Jura.  You finishing means we can leave.
-1-female_masturbating,target:jura=happy-2,Just in case you were worried, Jura, yes.  You're very beautiful.
-1-female_masturbating,target:jura=interested-2,That's basically the pose I assumed when I did it.  Was I really presenting that much?
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,I wish Jura were here.  One night with you would set her straight.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon=pleased-2,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward-2,For a mutual masturbation session, you two are...surprisingly not so intimate.  Must be the sibling relationship...
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward-2,Aren't you two sisters?  I guess that's why you're not touching more than necessary...
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking-2,I suppose this is just sisters helping each other, and not any sort of romance...
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan=pleased-2,You're reminding me of home...besides the fact you're sisters, which Mejare still frowns upon.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=annoyed-2,...I guess you have this under control.  I still don't condone it.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=horny-2,This still isn't safe, but...those muscles really are something else.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=horny-2,There they go...at least they haven't killed anyone.  And it's certainly putting their muscles on display...
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=horny-2,I need an exercise partner...someone who can push my limits like that.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,If I wanted to look at a soggy brown mess, I'd pay the Harvest a visit.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Maybe it's not what you wanted from this game, Jura, but meeting this girl has given me a new appreciation for your subtlety.
-1-female_masturbating,target:moon,alsoPlaying:jura=disappointed-2,If you want me to find you attractive, put some meat on your bones.
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy=pleased-2,I really thought this would bring out another side to you, but I guess there are none.
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy=bored-2,Meeting you is really causing me to reevaluate my own abrasiveness.  Masturbating has helped with that already...
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy=pleased-2,If this is what having sex with men does to you, count me out.
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,Can you...get loose?  I hate being restrained...
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,Are you OK, Vriska?  Do you want to be untied?  Has the die done this before?
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,Are you sure you don't want the ropes undone?  Vriska?
-1-female_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,You're OK, right?  Being tied up doesn't bother you?  Vriska?
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,I pictured B.C. doing this for a second...but that image probably isn't right.
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Open your heart, my Fama always said...
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,What do you think, Jura?  Is our elegant Mejarian technique any better than this?
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=happy-2,This is actually rather soothing...
-1-female_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,Picture yourself in a hot spring...
-1-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=awkward-2,Uh...I'll think I'll stick to my own methods.
-1-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=impressed-2,I'm a fan of new formations, but...only for piloting.
-1-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,targetTimeInStage:0-0,totalMasturbating:1-1=bored-2,...There's a level of "comfort" I don't really want to go past.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=pleased-2,I'd prefer having my other hand free, personally.
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=confused-2,How <i>are</i> you making that webbing?
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,priority:0=addressing-2,Swinging around like that looks more distracting than satisfying.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=impressed-2,Hard to believe I'm sitting here next to a fairy...especially a <i>masturbating</i> one.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=addressing-2,Looks a little distracting to keep yourself afloat like that.  I definitely would have tried, though.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu,priority:0=pleased-2,Some girls might masturbate in their Dreads...maybe I should give that a try.
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased-2,Must be nice not having to sit to masturbate...or stand, which some women seem to do.
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=addressing-2,Floating there looks nice.  Can it be taught?
-1-female_masturbating,target:marceline,priority:0=pleased-2,I'd ask how you're flying, but you seem beyond normal humanity in too many other ways for me to learn.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=impressed-2,Bondage...?  Not for me...
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=disappointed-2,I wouldn't want to be tied up...wouldn't put it past Barnette, though.
-1-female_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch,priority:0,marker:claustrophobia=thinking-2,I can hardly watch this...are you alright?  You <i>chose</i> this, right?
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=pleased-2,That's certainly <i>one</i> way to use your powers...I won't deny I'd have tried it if I had them.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=horny-2,Floating and masturbating...it must be quite the workout, having to suspend yourself as you lose control.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=interested-2,Are you alright, Ochako?  I wouldn't be able to focus on holding myself up like that...you saw how I just sat on the floor.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,priority:0=stretching-2,That actually looks like fun, Ochako...mostly the floating, of course.  I've masturbated enough for one evening...
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed-2,Flying just seems like it'd be distracting...
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed-2,Does flying take a lot of effort to do?
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,We would be forever in your debt if you taught us how to fly, Videl.
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,If we learn how to fly tonight, Jura, I will absolutely give you credit when the crew asks about it.  This was your idea.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=impressed-2,You're, uh...really getting into this.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Something about finally getting out your bodysuit <i>does</i> get the waterworks going...
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,Dirty talk...is alright in small doses.
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,This is too much dirty talk.  Hear that, Jura?  <i>Too much</i>...as in, enough to carry through the walls at night.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=horny-2,I can't help but watch...you're so <i>fit</i>.  You're wonderful to look at.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=impressed-2,Did you just...in your...maybe <i>I</i> should try that.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=thinking-2,Your finger...are you...<i>really</i>?  I wonder if that feels good...
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=addressing-2,Earth women are something else...that's just dirty.  Maybe I'll try it in my next moment of weakness.
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah=addressing-2,I'm conflicted...between your muscles and your choice of orifice.  Just do it to yourself and not me.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed-2,Apparently flying is a fairly common skill among Earthlings...but you're using different methods, as I understand it.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=interested-2,Two Earth women flying and masturbating...but apparently Videl wasn't <i>born</i> able to, so maybe there's hope for me.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=impressed-2,I expected to maybe see a man's tube here...not two different women flying and masturbating.  Without any wings.
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:videl,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased-2,Two women masturbating in the air is <i>not</i> what I thought this night would give me.  Still, I'd like to learn Videl's method...
-1-female_finished_masturbating=addressing-2,What a finish...worthy of the sounds I hear Jura make at night.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=addressing-2,Heehee.  Do <i>I</i> make that face?
-1-female_finished_masturbating=pleased-2,That's a face I might expect from Dita.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=interested-2,This eases the sting of defeat a little...
-1-female_finished_masturbating=happy-2,You'd be right at home on Mejare.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=addressing-2,Never thought I'd meet someone like <i>you</i> here, Aimee.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=addressing-2,Never before has a woman left me speechless.  Congratulations.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:aimee=bored-2,Please go home before you kill someone...and tell your "darlin'" you love him.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,Worthy of the sounds that keep me up at night.  Usually from <i>your</i> room, Jura.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=addressing-2,Heehee.  Do <i>I</i> make that face?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=pleased-2,That's a face I might expect from Dita.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=interested-2,This eases the sting of defeat a little...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=happy-2,You'd be right at home on Mejare.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=bored-2,Thank Ma it's over.  Now go away.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=addressing-2,Every opportunity you have to show me hidden depths, you swim closer to the surface.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=addressing-2,You've taught me more about sex tonight than any man could.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward-2,Hello again...Blue Launch.  If you're worried about your condition, you can come aboard the Nirvana.  We have a doctor.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=awkward-2,Oh, good, you're back to the blue version.  I should take you to Duero to figure out what's wrong...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=disappointed-2,At least you're polite again.  Listen, I know a skilled doctor...perhaps he could figure out what's wrong with you.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy-2,Better blue, at least, but that's just a bandage on the problem.  If you want medical treatment, I can take you to someone...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=stretching-2,It's over...finally.  Let's get going, Jura.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=addressing-2,Alright, you've had your fun, and forced me into it, too.  Congratulations.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=pleased-2,That was surprisingly quiet.  I'm pretty sure I shouted out...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=stretching-2,You must be very pleased with yourself, dragging me here.  Well, it doesn't matter now.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry-2,Wha--<i>ow</i>!  A pilot's hearing is important, you know!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry-2,A-agh!  <i>Was that really necessary</i>?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=angry-2,You nearly ruptured my eardrums!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=pleased-2,That'd probably knock <i>me</i> over, too.  But then, I'm not used to...<i>penetration</i>.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=addressing-2,...Is this how sex with men leaves you, too?  Or just vines in particular?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=addressing-2,I imagine I'd have a similar reaction to anything that big being inside me.  But aren't Earth women used to that?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=pleased-2,...I hope Earth women don't <i>all</i> require something that big to climax...or any penetration at all.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy-2,Good...it's over.  Still, I want to thank you for showing me how far I still have to go, fitness-wise.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pleased-2,No way I could keep up with either of you.  I need to train harder...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=interested-2,I need more time in the gym.  I wouldn't have lasted one second against you two...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=happy-2,It's good to meet people in better shape...it lets you know how high you can climb.  Thank you.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward-2,...Oh, good, she's gone.  I mean...it was just so shocking.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward-2,...I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  I was too shocked to find that erotic, Elizabeth...
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward-2,...I see you enjoy women's company.  Or at least your own.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=awkward-2,...I have absolutely no clue what to make of you, Elizabeth.  But...I hope that was good for you.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=stretching-2,Seems your powers mostly come from self-control.  Maybe <i>I'd</i> be better suited for them.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=interested-2,Lost control of yourself, Ochako?  Don't feel bad.  As long as you enjoyed yourself, that's what matters.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=happy-2,Seems you overwhelmed yourself.  That's fine...it just means you're healthy.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=addressing-2,Are you alright, Ochako?  Seems you still need a better grasp of the power you wield.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=impressed-2,As quickly as she came...she hardly said a thing.  What was she waiting for all this time?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=thinking-2,Just like that, she vanishes...magic is impressive, but maybe I'm better off without it.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=disappointed-2,And now she's leaving?  She didn't even introduce herself.  Is she just your sex pet?
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward-2,...I don't know how to feel about this entire situation.  It's hard to stay stoic when a winged woman summons her partners like that.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,Thank Ma it's over.  Are you alright, Vriska?  Please tell me you're alright.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=shocked-2,Thank Ma the ropes are gone.  What <i>was</i> that?  Don't scare me like that!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska,marker:claustrophobia=thinking-2,Are you OK, Vriska?  You got free, somehow.  Not sure what the fluid is...but I'm so sorry.




#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3,marker:unaware_mast=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  <i>Jura</i>!  You--I trusted you!
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3,marker:unaware_mast=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Jura!  You <i>knew</i> about this?
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:unaware_mast=angry,I can't believe I went and--I have to <i>masturbate</i>?  Jura!  You didn't mention that!
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:unaware_mast=stressed,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Jura--<i>I can't believe you</i>.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:unaware_mast=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  <i>Jura</i>!  You'd really mislead me like this?
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:unaware_mast=stressed,I lose first, <i>and</i> I have to masturbate?  What kind of sick place did you drag me to, Jura?  These people aren't of sound mind.
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:unaware_mast=angry,The first to lose...the first to <i>what</i>?  Jura!
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:unaware_mast=stressed,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Jura--you--I--<i>really</i>?
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:unaware_mast=stressed,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Jura!  You brought me here to <i>masturbate</i> in front of these poeple?
-3-must_masturbate_first,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,marker:unaware_mast=annoyed,<i>Masturbate</i>?  Well, when you lose as badly as I do, suppose there's no right to complain.
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99,marker:unaware_mast=disappointed,You finally got me...what do you mean, <i>masturbate</i>?
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99,marker:unaware_mast=angry,<i>Masturbate</i>?  First my streak ends, and now this...
-3-must_masturbate_first,timeInStage:7-99,marker:unaware_mast=annoyed,I have to <i>masturbate</i>, too?  Fine...at least I made you earn it.
-3-must_masturbate=bored,Wasn't picturing myself doing <i>this</i> at any point...
-3-must_masturbate=interested,A loss is a loss.  Well played.
-3-must_masturbate=addressing,Congrats.  You were worthy opponents.
-3-must_masturbate=pleased,You've bested me.  Well, here's your reward...
-3-must_masturbate=interested,I underestimated you.  Here's your prize...
-3-must_masturbate=bored,I lost my composure...though I tried to hide it.
-3-must_masturbate=annoyed,At least this will make me feel better.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=disappointed,And just like that, I'm out.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=bored,A swift and accurate kill...like every pilot goes for.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Two shots, one kill.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=thinking,Before I even had time to gather myself...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:0-0=unimpressed,Well, I hope you didn't enjoy the full-length view...
-3-must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=thinking,Even worse, there's a man here...
-3-must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=bored,Having a man here just makes things worse...
-3-must_masturbate,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=bored,And with a man leering at me...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Well, it finally happened.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=bored,The time has come at last.  Here we go...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=bored,At least I wasn't the first to lose.  Would have helped to know we had to do this...
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,I lost...but at least I held you off for a while there.
-3-must_masturbate,timeInStage:7-99=thinking,Sometimes all you can do is stave off the inevitable...and hope your crewmates are there for you.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,You'd have to teach me what a proper pirate duel is first.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:elaine=disappointed,Dueling for sport?  Sounds like a <i>male</i> activity.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=unimpressed,I know damn well how to masturbate.  I just choose not to make a scene of my sex life, unlike you.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=disappointed,Not <i>everyone</i> chooses to broadcast her sexuality to anyone nearby.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,The last thing I need you to talk about is sex.  Try focusing on piloting for once...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,My sexual history...is none of your concern.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=bored,I'd like a second to reflect on how I could've improved my poker play before jumping into masturbation...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Unbelievable...well, not losing, but my timing.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,...Oh, great.  And with Jura doing it, too...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=unimpressed,Well, Jura, we've hit the worst-case scenario...not for you, I'm sure.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=bored,Bad time for me to choke the game away...now we have to masturbate together.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=pleased,...I'll be honest, Jura, masturbating with you was never on the list of things I wanted to do with my life.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=disappointed,Damn.  Well, at least my subordinate's paved the way for me.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,Well, Jura, you <i>were</i> wearing one more layer than I was.  So on an even playing field, I would've won.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,I could make a comment about how you wore more clothing in the end, but that'd just be making excuses.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=addressing,Well, you started off with more clothing.  But since that's part of the game, it's just another thing I could have improved.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=pleased,If I were a pettier woman, I'd note how you lost more layers than I did.  But I should've known better than to wear my flightsuit here anyway.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,Definitely not my A-game...but it's nice to see you brought <i>yours</i>.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=interested,Well, let's see...we've both removed five items, so yes, you really <i>have</i> beaten me.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,I can't stay mad.  Not when my second-in-command kept her cool under pressure for once.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=addressing,Good work beating me, Jura.  Now stay put and don't do it yourself...Barnette wouldn't like that.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,You make fun, but I'm not all that mad.  You played really well, Jura.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=interested,I'm mad at myself for losing, and at you for lying to me.  But you winning...I like that kind of skill.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=pleased,If only you demonstrated this kind of skill at the controls of your Dread.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,...Good job, Jura.  I'm proud of you, managing to beat me after all these years.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,You beat me fair and square, Jura.  Pretty sure you started with more on, but clearly that didn't matter.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=interested,I can't fault your performance tonight, Jura.  I'm glad you've actually been listening to me when I make you play cards.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,You might still be a shameful flirt, but at least it seems like your tactical skills are improving.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=addressing,You can insist this game is luck, Jura, but what you showed me tonight was skill.  Well done.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,Can't believe I only beat you <i>once</i>.  You've impressed me tonight, Jura.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,You make fun, but I'm honestly really impressed.  Maybe I'll start giving you more responsibilities.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=addressing,It's really too bad you chose to show me how skilled you were in such a stupid game.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=interested,You've shown me hidden depths tonight, Jura.  I don't even feel all that bad about losing...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=bored,For once, I fully support you making fun of me.  You beat me so soundly that I deserve it.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=addressing,Couldn't make you lose <i>one</i> hand...clearly I'm losing my touch.  Maybe <i>you</i> should command the squadron...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,I'm really, honestly impressed with you, Jura.  I didn't take you seriously at all...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=interested,Great job, Jura.  To beat me this badly...I'm proud to call you my second-in-command.
-3-must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=addressing,Well done...guess I better get started.
-3-must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=happy,Well, you beat me fair and square.  Congratulations.
-3-must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=addressing,Well done.  Enjoy the show.
-3-must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=pleased,Looks like I really <i>do</i> have to show everything...
-3-must_masturbate,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=happy,You beat me, and on my own terms.  Good game.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=disappointed,I'm a little less than impressed, Jura.  You even masturbated to completion before I lost...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=addressing,At least you and I didn't have to do it together, Jura.  That would've been truly painful.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=pleased,Thank God I at least held it together until <i>you</i> finished up.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=unimpressed,Well, Jura, if you've ever been curious about how I masturbate, today's your lucky day.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:kyu,priority:150,count-jura:1=confused,There I go, losing like a fool...wait, what's a <i>lesbian</i>?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:kyu,priority:150,count-jura:1=confused,...I know I'm a space pirate, but...what does <i>lesbian</i> mean?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:kyu,priority:150,count-jura:1=awkward,Glad you like us, Kyu...but I don't know what "lesbian" means.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:kyu,priority:150,count-jura:1=awkward,..."Lesbian"?  There you go again, using Earth terms I don't understand.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:kyu,priority:150,count-jura:1=bored,...Maybe you could fill me in on what a "lesbian" is.  That'll take my mind off having to masturbate for an audience.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,You know, I tend to last pretty long...fair warning.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,I can last the longest on the whole crew...according to the honor system.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,This'll take a while...it <i>always</i> takes me a while.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Alright, alright.  Let me focus...
-3-start_masturbating,marker:oma_and_fama=mast-1,If my Fama could see me now...
-3-start_masturbating,marker:oma_and_fama=mast-1,What would my mothers think of me?  ...That's the word, right?  Mother?
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Despite what Jura might tell you, I <i>do</i> have a sexuality...
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Some of my crewmates would say I'm asexual...because they can't imagine having the decency to keep to themselves.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Now be quiet and let me concentrate.
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,...
-3-start_masturbating=mast-1,Is this what you wanted to see?  Well, get a good look.
-3-start_masturbating,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=mast-1,Having no men around means this isn't <i>that</i> strange...
-3-start_masturbating,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=mast-1,It's just women...pretend you're back on board.
-3-start_masturbating,totalFemales:5-5,priority:0=mast-1,All women or not, no one bother me...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,Your lens is far too clouded with hormones to assess how eager anyone is.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,Not sure I should trust <i>your</i> analysis on how eager someone is, considering you always are.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,I think being naked has gotten you a little too amped-up to judge my sexuality.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:6=mast-1,...Being naked is making you even more lecherous than usual.  Maybe <i>you</i> need to take the edge off.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit=mast-1,I'm not the most sexual woman on Mejare...I don't like getting too close.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit=mast-1,I have a lot of alone time, but I try not to use it like <i>this</i>.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit=mast-1,...You fight <i>space pirates</i>?  Tell me about them so I don't have to focus on this.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato=mast-1,Ignorance of the rules is no excuse not to follow them, Misato.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato=mast-1,I lost...so I have to pay the price.  That's all there is to it.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato=mast-1,I'd be quite the coward if I didn't comply with the rules.  It's not like this will put me in harm's way.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elaine=mast-1,<i>Sword fighting</i>?  I've never even held a sword.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elaine=mast-1-pleased,If you want a swordfight, ask Jura.  Though her rapier is mostly just for show.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,Just ignore him, Meia...
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,I'm doing this on honor alone.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,Losing is so infuriating...losing to a man is doubly so.
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,This can't be all that special to an Earth man, right?
-3-start_masturbating,totalMales:1-1,priority:0=mast-1,I'm sure this isn't all that bizarre for an Earth man...a Tarakkian would be convinced I'm about to eat his face.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:d.va_wager_set,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=mast-1,<i>Don't touch me</i>.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:d.va_wager_set,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=mast-1,I'm annoyed enough as it is.  Come anywhere near me and you'll regret it.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:d.va_wager_set,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=mast-1,I believe people have to <i>agree</i> to bets before they're bound to them, D.Va.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:d.va_wager_set,totalMasturbating:0-0,totalFinished:0-0=mast-1,I wasn't aware of this rule at all.  I'm sure as hell not honoring your stupid side bets.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-1,I'd say our professional relationship is already in tatters, considering we're making public nude appearances.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-1,Feel free to never talk to me about this ever again.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-1,It'd be best for everyone if we never acknowledged this in any capacity.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8=mast-1,I'm glad you're all done regardless of how I would've had to join you otherwise.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,Be quiet, Jura.  I'm doing this for honor's sake.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,As if I'd accept your help.  Barnette would put a bullet in my back.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,Please just stay over there...I don't think I could work with you anymore if we touched.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,I hope our guests appreciate the added awkwardness of us knowing each other, Jura.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7=mast-1,You'd think masturbating with a stranger would be more awkward, but no...this is definitely worse.
-3-start_masturbating,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=mast-1-pleased,You've certainly earned this...I'll give you a decent view for your trouble.
-3-start_masturbating,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=mast-1-pleased,I'd say be proud of the victory more than anything.  My body is nothing special.
-3-start_masturbating,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=mast-1-pleased,At least this will put me at ease.  You might be left a little frustrated.
-3-start_masturbating,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=mast-1-pleased,I think I've gained a little respect for you.  A little.
-3-start_masturbating,saidMarker:one-on-one,priority:1000=mast-1-pleased,You'd better appreciate this.  Losing is embarrassing enough for me, you know.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,There's blood running through my veins, Jura.  I've masturbated before.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,Just because I don't brag about to passersby doesn't mean I don't masturbate.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,...I'm not going to sit here and humor the notion that I'm an asexual gynoid.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=mast-1,...It's hard to take you seriously when you never do it for <i>me</i>.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,You don't know your precious squadron leader all that well if you think this is thrilling me.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,...Never a sincere moment with you, is there?
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,I'll get started now...look, Jura, I'm doing this because I <i>have</i> to.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4=mast-1,Whether I want to do it or not doesn't matter...don't tell me <i>you</i> do.  You have a girlfriend already...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,There's no way I can save face at this point...fire away.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,Well, Jura, if you <i>really</i> wanted to see me like this, here you go.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,I'm going to go ahead and guess that your grand plan was to embarrass me into going easier on you.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0=mast-1,If you think this gives you some dirt on me, I'm only ashamed of losing, not of my body.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,I'm not embarrassed, Jura...just a little miffed.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,You really should have told me about this rule...but then, I should have won.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,There's no use feigning shame, Jura.  You've never felt shame, especially not secondhand.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3=mast-1,Leave the shame and humiliation to me.  You've earned your victory, so enjoy it.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,...It's useless trying to convince you some people keep these things private.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,...I can't even convince myself to fire back.  Not when you've beaten me so easily...
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,...Absolutely, Jura.  I'm a virgin.  Never even touched <i>myself</i>.  Precisely.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2=mast-1,Somehow you've got my poker face completely figured out, but not me as a person.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,Just because you flaunt your sexuality in front of everyone doesn't mean the rest of us don't possess any.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,You'll have to excuse me for politely keeping my sexuality to myself.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,I masturbate.  Even if I were to make noises you could hear, you and Barnette would always drown me out anyway.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1=mast-1,I masturbate in my room without bothering anyone like a normal person.  <i>You</i> make sure everyone knows the ins and outs of your sex life.

-2-masturbating=mast-2,Now I'm getting into it...
-2-masturbating=mast-2,Maybe this isn't so bad...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,This feels great...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,My head is pounding...
-2-masturbating=mast-2,Now watch as I leave "signposts" for you...
-2-masturbating=mast-2,I have a method, and I'm sticking to it...
-2-masturbating=mast-3,...
-2-masturbating=mast-3-pleased,See how wet I am?  Tarakkians think it's acid.
-2-masturbating=mast-3-pleased,Mejarians are taught to never expose ourselves like this...wouldn't want to damage the product.
-2-masturbating=mast-4,This is wonderful...maybe I need to do it more.
-2-masturbating=mast-3,<i>Mmm</i>...
-2-masturbating=mast-4,This feels so nice...it's been too long.
-2-masturbating=mast-2,Maybe I've waited too long to do this...I should keep a better schedule.
-2-masturbating=mast-4,Ahh...<i>that's it</i>.
-2-masturbating=mast-4,I forgot how good this feels...guess I've been pent-up, after all.
-2-masturbating=mast-3-pleased,I can't believe I'm doing this...but it really isn't that bad.
-2-masturbating=mast-2,The less I think about this, the better...
-2-masturbating=mast-4,Best to just let my hands guide me...the body knows best.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,...Men really are full of surprises.  But then, so am I.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-disappointed,...So you can't fly with those wings?  Why does your species have them?  Or nipples, for that matter?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,I think I read about angels as a girl...but they sure weren't depicted as winged men.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-disappointed,...I see you'd rather use natural advantages than take your loss with any dignity intact.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-4-disappointed,I assure you, being seen naked will not devalue you as a person.  Cheating, on the other hand, does.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-disappointed,...Better than killing us, I suppose, but it's still pathetic to stave off a loss like this.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-4-disappointed,Can't you just accept defeat with your honor intact?  That would actually give me some respect for you.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-4-disappointed,Even naked, you still had a chance.  This isn't even cheating to avoid total defeat.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,And what do everyone's lives need saving from, exactly?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-4-pleased,Surely you can think of a better insult than <i>buzzkill</i>.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,I can't help but kill the buzz when a woman can't keep my interest.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:meia_buttstuff=mast-4-pleased,"Finger in my butt," Sei?  Earth women are so vulgar.  Must be from living around men.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,I must say, Pit, you're a new experience for me.  I never knew men could experience shyness.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-4-pleased,I guess you're not too concerned with winning...which makes this even more embarrassing.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Talking to you is exhausting...so is masturbating near you.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,Well, at least we're both having a good time.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-3-pleased,I like to stay sober...even like this.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=mast-2-disappointed,<i>Nanobots</i>?  Our crew is a little touchy when it comes to robots and body parts.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I suppose since you're finished, you can devote all your mental energy to making fun of me now.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,You may have forced me to do this, Jura, but you're not going to ruin it for me now that I'm doing it.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Might as well enjoy myself.  Better that than humiliation and shame...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,You seem more focused now...maybe I should force you to have sex before missions start.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,You're totally at ease, Jura...I suppose you're in your element here.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I don't need any help, thanks.  And don't think I'll forget how you dragged me here.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Don't say I never did anything for you, Jura.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Laugh it up, Jura.  I'm sure this is all you were hoping for from the beginning.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,I can't think of a more fitting punishment for losing than having to masturbate as you prattle on next to me.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,You wanted me to loosen up, right?  Well, mission accomplished.  I'd say the whole night's gone perfectly for you.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Just focus on your girlfriend so I don't have to play marriage counselor in the middle of our next battle.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,If two colleagues masturbating is what gets Earthlings going, I'm glad we don't live here.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Somehow I doubt Barnette's going to remain oblivious to this.  Can't wait for <i>that</i> conversation.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:7,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Well, Jura, I'm feeling a little better, at least.  Is that you wanted to hear?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,Your ego's even bigger than I imagined if you think I'd masturbate to you, nude or otherwise.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Please, Jura.  My thoughts are lightyears away from you.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I see you nude in the showers every day.  Hate to say it, Jura, but you're mundane at this point.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Can't you be humble for once?  I'm not going to eye up my subordinate's body.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,Please don't come anywhere near me.  That's <i>not</i> the direction I want our relationship to go in.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I've always been satisfied with the way I masturbate, thanks.  I don't need any help...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Well, Jura, you wanted me to loosen up, right?  If this doesn't count, then you'll <i>never</i> be happy.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,I hope you're proud of me, finally acting as indecent as you do for once.  Consider it a moment of outreach.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I'd very much prefer you stuck to Barnette, since you two breaking up would cause nothing but trouble on missions.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Believe me when I say I've never done this anywhere but alone in my room.  I'm not aiming to bother others.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,Don't make this more awkward than it already is, Jura.  Keep your clothes on.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:3,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I don't know why you expected something special.  I'm like any other woman...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,I just want to look professional and set an example for the crew...we're not there to flaunt our bodies.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Just look at this as me keeping my word, Jura.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,I don't back down from a challenge.  That's all this is...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Don't say stupid things...I'm just doing what's required of me.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,I lost, and I'm paying the price...nothing more.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=mast-3,This <i>does</i> feel a lot like the Paksis...I guess it's brought us all closer together.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Whomever I think about is none of your concern.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,What do you want me to say, Jura?  That I masturbate to the thought of <i>you</i>?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,If you think I'd ever masturbate to the men, you're crazy...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=mast-2,No point in staying stoic like <i>this</i>, is there?
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:1,priority:0=mast-4-pleased,Don't think for a second my eyes are going to wander to <i>you</i>, Jura...you're not even naked.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=mast-3-disappointed,I'm torn between complimenting your poker skills and disparaging your licentiousness.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,At least you're feeling protective of me.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,Oh, stop making stupid comments and let me focus.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0,priority:0=mast-3-pleased,You only think I'm asexual because I know what privacy means.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=mast-3-pleased,Mejarians are born from two women, Sei.  The Oma donates half an egg, and the Fama carries the combination...

-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,I just don't see what the issue is, Pit.  Aren't you proud of your body?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=awkward-2,Why are you so embarrassed?  You don't seem to have any deformities...not that I'm an expert on male anatomy.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,Life gets a lot worse than nudity, Pit.  Just look at me.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=pleased-2,I guess you're not too concerned with winning...which makes losing to you even more embarrassing.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,Talking to you is exhausting...so was masturbating near you.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,Well, at least I'm more relaxed now, even if you're having more fun.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=pleased-2,I like to stay sober...even like this.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=confused-2,Expensive...?  On Mejare, you're told where to live...and you live there.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed-2,And what do everyone's lives need saving from, exactly?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,Surely you can think of a better insult than <i>buzzkill</i>.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,I can't help but kill the buzz when a woman can't keep my interest.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,..."Condoms"?  What are those?  Something that controls birth?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,...What's a <i>condom</i>?  Why are you all hushed up about it?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=bored-2,...No, I <i>don't</i> know.  You could be more considerate of a woman who isn't from Earth and doesn't know what condoms are.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ochako_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=awkward-2,...What is it about sex with men that makes Earth women get all quiet?  And what's a <i>condom</i>?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:insulting_meia,saidMarker:marinette_phc=disappointed-2,Whatever you just called me, Marinette, I've heard worse from Mejarian soldiers.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:insulting_meia,saidMarker:marinette_phc=unimpressed-2,I thought superheroes were supposed to be brave, but apparently you don't have the nerve to insult me in a language I understand, Marinette.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:insulting_meia,saidMarker:marinette_phc=disappointed-2,You know what I <i>do</i> respect, Marinette?  A woman who can look me in the eye when she takes issue with me.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elaine,timeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,We can talk if you want, Elaine, but all I'll drink is water.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elaine,timeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,I wouldn't mind a chat with an Earth woman.  Might be informative.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elaine,timeInStage:0-0=afterglow,A drink?  No thanks...but I'll chat with you, sure.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed-2,...I see you'd rather use natural advantages than take your loss with any dignity intact.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed-2,I assure you, being seen naked will not devalue you as a person.  Cheating, on the other hand, does.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=bored-2,...Better than killing us, I suppose, but it's still pathetic to stave off a loss like this.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=unimpressed-2,Can't you just accept defeat with your honor intact?  That would actually give me some respect for you.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-0=disappointed-2,Even naked, you still had a chance.  This isn't even cheating to avoid total defeat.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato,timeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,I take my job seriously...that's all.  I enjoy sex as much as anyone else.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato,timeInStage:0-0=pleased-2,I'm a leader, Misato.  Not a robot.  Even the robots I know have feelings.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato,timeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,I'm like any other woman, Misato.  I just take my responsibilities seriously.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato,timeInStage:0-0=afterglow,Stoicism is important for a leader...but I'm not leading anyone right now.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:misato,timeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,Well, Misato...masturbating tends to be relaxing.  I can't help being human.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=afterglow,Is that so?  I guess it's just the way I am...because I wasn't holding back.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,I'll be sure to roll my eyes back and scream next time, Mahiru.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,In my experience, Mahiru, the female orgasm is a subtle thing indeed.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=stretching-2,It certainly was fun for <i>me</i>, Mahiru.  I guess I just don't like sharing the experience.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mahiru,timeInStage:0-0=afterglow,Really?  That felt great...shame you couldn't see it in my face.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=happy-2,To answer your question, Sei...sort of.  Both my parents were women.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=interested-2,Mejarians are born from two women, Sei.  The Oma donates half an egg, and the Fama carries the combination...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:seiof,notSaidMarker:seiof_response,marker:seiof_response=pleased-2,...If <i>mother</i> and <i>father</i> helps you understand, Sei, then yes.  Though I can't picture a man being a parent.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=addressing-2,Of course women can do what they want with their bodies.  Doesn't mean I have to respect them for it.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=pleased-2,Of course women can groom as they please.  I just find it distasteful.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:phc,notSaidMarker:marinette_phc,marker:marinette_phc=addressing-2,Pubic hair just strikes me as something a <i>man</i> would have, Marinette.  Not for me.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,...I don't understand.  Why wouldn't you be able to feel your partner's skin?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=disappointed-2,Why are you getting all defensive?  I really don't know what this "birth control" is.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mari_bc,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,Proper measures?  What exactly are you worried about?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,Ah...that was refreshing.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=happy-2,That's a side of me few have seen.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,Mmm...I hope you appreciated that.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,Did you like that?  I did.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,...And that's how we do things on Mejare.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,Oof.  I hit <i>nirvana</i> for a second there.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,I was feeling a little pent-up today...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,Hah...hah...I needed that.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=happy-2,I hope you're proud of yourself, making me do that...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,That completes my rounds for the day...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,Mmm...that was relaxing.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=stretching-2,Great...I'll never hear the end of this, will I, Jura?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=afterglow,I should do that more often...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,...I'm totally lost.  She said something about controlled birth?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=bored-2,I'm lost.  Earth women control birth?  I think Tarak does something like that...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,I'm lost here.  What exactly is "birth control"?  How would you control birth?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,timeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,That comparison is lost on me, Pit.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,timeInStage:0-0=addressing-2,That <i>sounds</i> intense, but I really don't think it was all that special.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,timeInStage:0-0=afterglow,Oh, please.  I'm like any other woman.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,<i>Protection</i>?  I have armor, but...you'd wear that during sex?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=shocked-2,<i>Protection</i>?  What the hell do men try to do to you?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bc_response,notSaidMarker:bc_confusion,marker:bc_confusion=confused-2,<i>Protection</i>?  You need <i>protection</i> during sex?  I thought she was talking about birth.

4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:misato,priority:0=smug,I'm sure I could help her with that, Misato.  Bring her along next time...and maybe it'll be <i>me</i> masturbating.
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:misato,priority:0=addressing,Just put this "Rei" in charge of a fleet of excitable young women.  That'll teach her leadership in a hurry.
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:nagisa,priority:0=smug,I'm sure it does, Nagisa.  And don't be so demure...women need to be strong, you know.

4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:nagisa,priority:0=smug,There's nothing embarrassing about nudity, Nagisa.  The female body is hardly the scariest thing in the universe.
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:nagisa,priority:0=smug,I'll have to give some of them a try, then.  Winning always puts me in a good mood.

4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:ami,priority:0=addressing,I'm about as far from a cadet as you can get, Ami.  I'm a pirate...and we cut to the bone.
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:ami,priority:0=smug,Surely masturbating in public garnered all the attention you wanted, Ami.
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:ami,priority:0=smug,Was I <i>really</i> the center of attention, Ami?  The one who <i>didn't</i> masturbate?
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=smug,I thought you said you've never been with a woman?  Surely my breasts will suffice, then.
4-game_over_victory,alsoPlaying:pit,priority:0=addressing,Sorry, Pit, but if I were to date a man, I'd like him a little taller.

#GAME OVER DEFEAT
game_over_defeat=pleased,Seems I've got a few things to learn myself.
game_over_defeat=addressing,You win this round, ~name~...
game_over_defeat=addressing,I absolutely hate losing...so I'll be back for more.
game_over_defeat=addressing,Don't get a big head.  There's always room for improvement, you know.
game_over_defeat=addressing,Don't get cocky.  I'd like to see you and Gascogne go head-to-head...
game_over_defeat=pleased,Seeing Hibiki play this would be very entertaining.
game_over_defeat=happy,What a night...I'm never this open with strangers.
game_over_defeat=happy,I don't know what's come over me...but this was a great time.
game_over_defeat=addressing,Don't think this is over.  I'll be back...because I <i>hate</i> losing.
game_over_defeat=pleased,This was fun...surprisingly so.
game_over_defeat=addressing,See you later, ~player~.
game_over_defeat=horny,I love competition...and even losing can be fun in this game.
game_over_defeat=interested,Ah, poker is always a good experience.
game_over_defeat=happy,This was fun.  Thank you.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:6-8=addressing,Good game, Sei.  Now let's see you beat me when we start on even footing.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:6-8=addressing,Well, you won, but not without an initial advantage.  I'm up for another round anytime.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:6-8=pleased,Can't believe I lost to a woman who's half in the bag.  Certainly puts a dent in my pride.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:6-8=addressing,I'd like to see you play Gascogne...but I wouldn't recommend drinking against <i>her</i>.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:0-5=addressing,Well, I may not care for your profession, Sei, but you certainly have respectable poker skills.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:0-5=interested,You beat me without breaking a sweat.  Women with hidden depths are always a treat to see.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:0-5=happy,You really showed me a thing or two, Sei.  I'd like to play against you again sometime.
game_over_defeat,target:sei,targetStage:0-5=addressing,Not bad, Sei.  I think I've come to respect you a little.
game_over_defeat,target:misato=stretching-2,I get plenty of social interaction, Misato.  It just tends not to involve public masturbation.
game_over_defeat,target:misato=stretching-2,This was far more sociable than I ever wanted to be, Misato.
game_over_defeat,target:misato=pleased-2,I'm just impressed an alcoholic managed to beat me.  What a sad performance on my part.
game_over_defeat,target:misato=stretching-2,This has convinced me piloting is all the social interaction I need, Misato.  But also that I should masturbate more.
game_over_defeat,target:misato=afterglow,Thanks, Misato, but all this has helped me realize is that I should masturbate more often.
game_over_defeat,target:misato=addressing-2,If it means I could meet this "Rei" character, then maybe I <i>should</i> be more sociable.

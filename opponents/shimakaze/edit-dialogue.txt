#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-,This is what the character says after they've been selected if the new triggers aren't used


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=damaged,It's okay, Marinette, my repair teams will put the fires out by themselves.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=damaged,Fire support? Me? No way, 9S, only Admiral would be able to organise something like that!

3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=clap,9S, you sound like Admiral when you say that!
3-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:5=clap,Admiral is always going on about how important 'reconnaissance' and 'spreadsheets' are, 9S. He'd agree with you!

3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:3=excited,No, wait, I got it! Those people from before were the ones you were looking for, from "shalaloo"!
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=excited,Ochako, you remind me of one of the ships at the base, Gamby!
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:4=excited,Ah, wait, I know now! You're a lot like Gamby, one of the American ships from the base!
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=thinking,Now that you mention it, I'm picking up something odd on my radar too, Cammy.
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm... I <i>am</i> picking up weird things on my radar as well, Cammy.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:Drink=aroused,Woah, Misato. You could drink a <i>sailor</i> under the table.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:Drink=aroused,Jun'you and Ashigara are pretty good drinkers, but <i>you're</i> not so bad either, Misato.

3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:2=determined,If it's for you, Prin- Miko, then we can make a concession!

3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=shuffle,Wait, yeah, you had a harp didn't you, Nayru?
3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:1=ganbatte,Ah, right, Nayru! Didn't you say you were an oracle or something?
3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:1=ganbatte,I think you mentioned before that you were an oracle, right, Nayru?
3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:2=determined,<i>Oooh</i>, if we had someone who could see the future at the base...
3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:2=determined,Being able to see the future sounds like it'd be really useful, actually.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=thinking,You say 'Akuma' a lot, Marinette, but... what are you talking about?
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calling,Anyway, Musashi, what are you doing here? Did Admiral grant you leave as well?

6-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=stumped,Ah, actually, maybe I was a little too quick to jump to conclusions about you, Ryuji.
6-female_human_must_strip=determined,Alright, I'm still in this race.
6-female_human_must_strip=excited,Yeah, looks like I'm good for another round!

6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:2=determined,<i>Oooh</i>, if we had someone who could see the future at the base...
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:2=determined,Being able to see the future sounds like it'd be really useful, actually.
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:1=ganbatte,Ah, right, Nayru! Didn't you say you were an oracle or something?
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:1=ganbatte,I think you mentioned before that you were an oracle, right, Nayru?

6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=shuffle,Oh, a harp? Are you some kind of musician, Nayru?
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=shuffle,Wait, yeah, you had a harp didn't you, Nayru?
6-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=thinking,You say 'Akuma' a lot, Marinette, but... what are you talking about?
6-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=thinking,Now that you mention it, I'm picking up something odd on my radar too, Cammy.
6-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=thinking,Hmm... I <i>am</i> picking up weird things on my radar as well, Cammy.
6-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:misatoayy=ganbatte,Misato, you said you fought aliens too, right?
6-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=clap,You look pretty tough, Rinkah! I wonder if you can beat Musashi in a fight?
6-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=ganbatte,Ah, Ochako! I have a question!
6-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=ganbatte,Hold on a second! Ochako! Can you explain something to me?
6-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=thinking,Do you have a way of detecting bad guys, Marinette? You would need one if you want to be a hero, right?
6-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:2=determined,If it's for you, Prin- Miko, then we can make a concession!
6-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=embarrassed,You're firing straight up?
6-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking,You know, Palutena, the way you dress reminds me of the statues I'd see at shrines.
6-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calling,Anyway, Musashi, what are you doing here? Did Admiral grant you leave as well?
6-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:Drink=aroused,Woah, Misato. You could drink a <i>sailor</i> under the table.
6-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:Drink=aroused,Jun'you and Ashigara are pretty good drinkers, but <i>you're</i> not so bad either, Misato.
6-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:7=stumped,Wait, hold on- Marinette? What's a "Tikki"?
6-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=ganbatte,Oh, Monika, are you gonna take off your-
6-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:3=excited,Ah, wait, I know, Cammy! Those are those "shadaboo" people you were talking about.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_removing_accessory=frustrated,You can take your time speaking <i>after</i> we start the next round!
0-male_removing_accessory=frustrated,I'm <i>not</i> mad right now!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=thinking,Your tactical visor... does that give you radar functions? Or adjust your firing angles?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=thinking,You don't look so good, actually. Are you a little out of shape?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=thinking,When's the last time you did some serious training?
0-male_removed_accessory=determined,You better not be making fun of me just because I lost!
0-male_removed_accessory=determined,This round, I'll show you why they named me "Island Breeze"!
0-male_removed_accessory=determined,I'll end this round so quickly, you won't know what hit you!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smug,You'll have to be in peak condition if you want to win a race against me, <i>hehehe</i>!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smug,If you're in anything less than perfect shape, I'll leave you in the dust, y'know?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,marker:dizzy=stumped,A lot of my information systems rely on my antenna array. It'd be bad if they came down...

0-female_removing_accessory=frustrated,I'm <i>not</i> mad right now!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,Can't say I know anything about what an oracle is. What do you do as an oracle, anyway?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=thinking,Well, I was just thinking, I don't actually <i>know</i> what an oracle does.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=smug,Y'see, whenever we have to fight the Abyssals, we have to sorta... 'track' them, and the way that we do that...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=smug,Sailing out to fight the Abyssals is super rough. We have to <i>find</i> them before we can fight them, but...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=thinking,Those stabilly things are gone now, and I can't see any engines on you. Or even wings! How do you fly around?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=thinking,No engine, no wings, no stabby things... how are you still flying around like that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=aroused,I'd offer to help you, but we have our hands full with the Abyssals.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,priority:100=clap,Now that I get to look at you, Jenetta, those rabbit ears are really cute!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,priority:100=clap,Are you some kind of rabbit, Jenetta? Rabbits are super cute!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=thinking,We don't have many musicians at the naval base… oh! Except Naka-chan!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't think any of the shipgirls at the base know how to play instruments... Well, there's Naka-chan, actually.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,<i>Mmm</i>, Marinette, I recognize your accent... <i>Ah</i>! You're French, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=shuffle,Oh, um, is that a camera, Mahiru?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Now that I think about it, the fairies at the base all look the same.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=shuffle,..? Hey, fairies, are our radars okay?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,So you're a Goddess! Do you know Amaterasu? Oh, or his descendant, His Majesty the Emperor?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=thinking,How strong <i>are</i> you? Could you punch a shell through thirty centimetres of steel?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shuffle,Ah, yeah, did you say you were a pilot or something, Jura?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Ah! I got it! Jura, you remind me of Saratoga!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=ganbatte,You're really adult, Jura! And really classy too, like a lady!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=mad,Caramel colored skin and abs of steel? You're not tricking me, "Rinkah".
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=mad,Ash white hair and half your 'clothes' are binding tape? You're not tricking me, "Rinkah".
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=aroused,Aww, guess we can't.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=thinking,Woah, Palutena. You sure have a lot of accessories on! Some of the bigger battleships are like that too, now that I think about it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=excited,And Richelieu's always looking into the newest fashions and trends. I think you'd be good friends!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=aroused,Now that I think about it, I should've known you weren't Musashi, Rinkah. You're not even wearing glasses!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=thinking,One of the shipgirls, Aoba, is the closest thing we have to a photographer - she's <i>actually</i> a reporter, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shuffle,Ah? You had a sword with you, Jura?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=ganbatte,Oh, uh, they've come back again!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, Ochako! You're all... floaty!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=shuffle,Oh, wait! You're a maid..? Are you that "Belfast" I've heard about?
0-female_removed_accessory=determined,You better not be making fun of me just because I lost!
0-female_removed_accessory=determined,This round, I'll show you why they named me "Island Breeze"!
0-female_removed_accessory=determined,I'll end this round so quickly, you won't know what hit you!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=aroused,Mmm, okay, they didn't seem very friendly, actually.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=aroused,Okay, maybe "friend" wasn't exactly the right word for that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Except… they're actually different people this time!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Hold on, are they a different group of people from before?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=frustrated,Aww! If I knew I could bring in weapons, I could have let Rensouhou-chan play too!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=aroused,One of the destroyers at the base is always going on about how she's a proper lady, but she's just a kid compared to you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=embarrassed,If you counted every single one of their AA emplacements... <i>uwaaah</i>, you'd be playing forever!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=clap,Saratoga's really tall, and really pretty, and really gentle, and really nice, and you're like that too!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=clap,I've never heard of a Vandread before, but that sounds kinda cool!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=stumped,I know about what the vanguard is, but I don't know what a van<i>dread</i> is...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=stumped,Do they ever change their clothes? Do you know, Kyu?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=thinking,Huh. Must've been a false reading.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,Mmm, well, actually... you're not English, and you don't <i>look</i> like a shipgirl at all...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=aroused,We kinda just sail around and hope we get there in the end, <i>hehe</i>. So, uh, don't suppose you can give us a hand some time?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=aroused,It's just a lot of guess work, actually. Not the greatest way to do it, but we don't have any better ways. Think you could sign up for service, Nayru?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=ganbatte,Most of Aoba's photos go into the base's newspaper. How about your pictures, Mahiru?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=clap,Woah, you can <i>travel through time</i>! Wah- that's amazing!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=clap,<i>Time travel</i>!? Oh, wow, that's super cool!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clap,Maybe you can teach me some French! Richelieu and Teste would be <i>so</i> surprised if I spoke it to them!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=excited,She's an idol, so she's really good at singing, and dancing too!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=excited,She doesn't play any instruments, but she's a good singer and dancer. She's an idol, after all!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,It'd be just like human clothing! Akashi can handle the materials and fitting too!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=clap,Oh, cool! Are you some kinda reporter or something?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Mmm, now that I get a good look at you... Maybe, just maybe, <i>you're not actually Musashi</i>?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=excited,But... <i>oh</i>! I think I heard that there are some tankgirls out there! Maybe they could give you a hand!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,priority:100=excited,I was designed - well, the second time around - after rabbits!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,priority:100=excited,Rabbits are really fast, too! Are you a good runner?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=stumped,G-guh...rave...ti? Uh, um...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=clap,Ooh, yeah, gur... guravetti! That's, uh, super cool!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=excited,She looks really reliable with them on! Maybe you should try glasses, some time!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=clap,That's... <i>so cool</i>! This is that 'Quirk' thing, right? Right!?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:palutena_magic=clap,Does it do anything for someone made out of steel, like me? Would it turn me into a human or something?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=smug,You'd have to do at least that to beat Musashi in a fight, Rinkah!

5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=aroused,Mmm, okay, they didn't seem very friendly, actually.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=aroused,Okay, maybe "friend" wasn't exactly the right word for that.

6-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=ganbatte,You're really adult, Jura! And really classy too, like a lady!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=thinking,How strong <i>are</i> you? Could you punch a shell through thirty centimetres of steel?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,So you're a Goddess! Do you know Amaterasu? Oh, or his descendant, His Majesty the Emperor?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Now that I think about it, the fairies at the base all look the same.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=shuffle,Oh, um, is that a camera, Mahiru?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=shuffle,Oh, wait! You're a maid..? Are you that "Belfast" I've heard about?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=excited,<i>Mmm</i>, Marinette, I recognize your accent... <i>Ah</i>! You're French, right?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shuffle,Ah, yeah, did you say you were a pilot or something, Jura?
6-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Is it because I'm new to this? Is there something I'm missing?
6-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Ehh? Is there a trick I don't know? A shortcut or something?
6-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Wait, does that make <i>you</i> really good at this, or am <i>I</i> just really bad at this..?
6-female_removed_accessory=thinking,Maybe I don't know the rules after all? Am I missing something?
6-female_removed_accessory=thinking,How... how does she do it? What the?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clap,Maybe you can teach me some French! Richelieu and Teste would be <i>so</i> surprised if I spoke it to them!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=ganbatte,Most of Aoba's photos go into the base's newspaper. How about your pictures, Mahiru?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,It'd be just like human clothing! Akashi can handle the materials and fitting too!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=excited,But... <i>oh</i>! I think I heard that there are some tankgirls out there! Maybe they could give you a hand!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=clap,Oh, cool! Are you some kinda reporter or something?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=smug,You'd have to do at least that to beat Musashi in a fight, Rinkah!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=clap,Woah, you can <i>travel through time</i>! Wah- that's amazing!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=clap,<i>Time travel</i>!? Oh, wow, that's super cool!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=aroused,We kinda just sail around and hope we get there in the end, <i>hehe</i>. So, uh, don't suppose you can give us a hand some time?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=aroused,It's just a lot of guess work, actually. Not the greatest way to do it, but we don't have any better ways. Think you could sign up for service, Nayru?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,Mmm, well, actually... you're not English, and you don't <i>look</i> like a shipgirl at all...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=embarrassed,If you counted every single one of their AA emplacements... <i>uwaaah</i>, you'd be playing forever!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Mmm, now that I get a good look at you... Maybe, just maybe, <i>you're not actually Musashi</i>?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=excited,She looks really reliable with them on! Maybe you should try glasses, some time!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=stumped,Do they ever change their clothes? Do you know, Kyu?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=clap,That's... <i>so cool</i>! This is that 'Quirk' thing, right? Right!?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=stumped,G-guh...rave...ti? Uh, um...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=clap,Ooh, yeah, gur... guravetti! That's, uh, super cool!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,priority:100=excited,I was designed - well, the second time around - after rabbits!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,priority:100=excited,Rabbits are really fast, too! Are you a good runner?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=excited,She's an idol, so she's really good at singing, and dancing too!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=excited,She doesn't play any instruments, but she's a good singer and dancer. She's an idol, after all!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:palutena_magic=clap,Does it do anything for someone made out of steel, like me? Would it turn me into a human or something?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=frustrated,Looks like our comms were worse that I thought. Better remember to tell Akashi about that...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=aroused,Mmm, okay, they didn't seem very friendly, actually.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=aroused,Okay, maybe "friend" wasn't exactly the right word for that.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Except… they're actually different people this time!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Hold on, are they a different group of people from before?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=frustrated,Aww! If I knew I could bring in weapons, I could have let Rensouhou-chan play too!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=clap,I've never heard of a Vandread before, but that sounds kinda cool!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=stumped,I know about what the vanguard is, but I don't know what a van<i>dread</i> is...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=clap,Saratoga's really tall, and really pretty, and really gentle, and really nice, and you're like that too!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=aroused,One of the destroyers at the base is always going on about how she's a proper lady, but she's just a kid compared to you.

7-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=smug,Y'see, whenever we have to fight the Abyssals, we have to sorta... 'track' them, and the way that we do that...
7-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=smug,Sailing out to fight the Abyssals is super rough. We have to <i>find</i> them before we can fight them, but...
7-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,So you're a Goddess! Do you know Amaterasu? Oh, or his descendant, His Majesty the Emperor?

7-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=thinking,Woah, Palutena. You sure have a lot of accessories on! Some of the bigger battleships are like that too, now that I think about it.
7-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=thinking,Those stabilly things are gone now, and I can't see any engines on you. Or even wings! How do you fly around?

7-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=thinking,I don't think any of the shipgirls at the base know how to play instruments... Well, there's Naka-chan, actually.
7-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=aroused,Now that I think about it, I should've known you weren't Musashi, Rinkah. You're not even wearing glasses!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=aroused,One of the destroyers at the base is always going on about how she's a proper lady, but she's just a kid compared to you.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Mmm, now that I get a good look at you... Maybe, just maybe, <i>you're not actually Musashi</i>?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=aroused,We kinda just sail around and hope we get there in the end, <i>hehe</i>. So, uh, don't suppose you can give us a hand some time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=aroused,It's just a lot of guess work, actually. Not the greatest way to do it, but we don't have any better ways. Think you could sign up for service, Nayru?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING

#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

6-male_chest_will_be_visible=smug,Here we go! There's not gonna be much left after this round.

6-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,targetStage:2,priority:100=excited,Some warships wear camo, but not me! I'm too fast to be seen anyway, haha!
6-male_chest_is_visible=aroused,Haha, this brings me back to the good old days in the IJN...
6-male_chest_is_visible=aroused,It's nearly a century later, and guys are still the same as always.
6-male_chest_is_visible=aroused,I guess not much has changed since the first time I was around.
6-male_chest_is_visible=aroused,Yeah, not bad. I wonder how you stack up to Admiral?
6-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular=aroused,Wow, ~name~, you're built like a battleship!
6-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular=aroused,Pretty solid chest you have there, ~name~. And that's coming from someone made out of steel!
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=thinking,Uh, 9S? You're missing your nipples... Did they cut costs for you too?
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=shuffle,Where are your nipples, 9S? I'm a warship and even I have those!
6-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=stumped,I thought males had nipples as well? Did they forget to attach some to you?
6-male_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:kyu,notSaidMarker:ceggs,marker:ceggs=mad,Hey, don't make fun of me! The fairies back at base never lay eggs!
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Time to see what's going on under the waterline...
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,You don't have any armor to hide behind now, ~name~.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Bet you're feeling pretty exposed now, ~name~.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,This is as light as you get, ~name~. Think you can keep up with me?
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smug,Looks like you've taken some real heavy damage this round, ~name~.
6-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stumped,Ah, does your equipment explode too, 9S? Yeah, I know how you feel.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=excited,Last one, right? Let's get going then!
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,I wouldn't quite call that a cannon. Maybe... an AA gun?
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking,We have mini-submarines at the base, but I don't think we have mini-torpedoes.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,...Not as cute as Rensouhou-chan.
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=excited,I guess this is your last dance, ~name~!
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=excited,Not long 'til your sortie ends, ~name~!
6-male_small_crotch_is_visible=excited,I think this is the end of the line for you, ~name~!
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=aroused,Hey! If you can sneak in a cannon like that, I'm going to call back Rensouhou-chan to play too.
6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=aroused,I didn't know humans could mount torpedoes like that.

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=stumped,If a warship shot up that high... Wait, our guns can't even aim that high to begin with...

6-female_small_chest_is_visible=clap,Ohhh, very aerodynamic! Nice!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=clap,Think of how fast you would be as a destroyer!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=clap,With a figure like that, you'd make for a pretty good runner!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=clap,If you're small, you just gotta put that to good use! Have you thought about taking up running?

6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko,targetStage:6=thinking,<i>Uhm.</i> Y-yeah..!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aroused,As a girl who's made of metal, I'm a little envious of how soft you humans can be.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smug,I may be a ship, but I'm still a girl. I can appreciate a nice chest.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=aroused,You'd think after spending every single day of your life around girls that you'd be immune to breasts.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smug,I'm a little excited. Guess all that time around sailors has rubbed off on me a bit.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=stumped,Nice ti- <i>geh</i>. Spend enough time with sailors and you start to talk like them too.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=excited,Kyu, woah! That was <i>awesome</i>! Can you teach the fairies at the base to do that?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=clap,Doesn't your body just feel all streamlined when it's on? It does, right?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=clap,<i>Wow!</i> The bullets just shower down like that? It's like when our battleships fire sanshikidan!

6-female_large_chest_is_visible=aroused,I see a lot of bare chests at the base - and I mean <i>a lot</i> - and I can say those are pretty <i>huge</i>.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=aroused,A chest like that'd belong on a super heavy battleship.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=aroused,Look at those breasts! Don't tell me that you're actually one of the Big Seven?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=aroused,I see you were made under the idea of 'Bigger is Better'.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=aroused,Breasts like those would fit right in amongst the battleships back home.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:american,notSaidMarker:americhest,priority:0,marker:americhest=excited,Iowa, Saratoga, even Gamby... Do all Americans have such huge chests?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:american,notSaidMarker:americhest,priority:0,marker:americhest=thinking,I need to ask Iowa what Americans eat to get so big up there.
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=aroused,Looks like you're equipped like a battleship in more ways than just your accessories, Palutena.

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=excited,Oh, I know! I have to tell Yukikaze about this!
6-female_crotch_is_visible=excited,You can still move, right? Then you'll be fine! Get back into the game!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

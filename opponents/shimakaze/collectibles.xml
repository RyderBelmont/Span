        <title>Rensouhou Plushie</title>
        <subtitle>A soft toy modeled after Shimakaze's sentient naval guns.</subtitle>
        <text>12.7cm/50 Type 3 naval gun.
The main gun of fleet destroyers.
Shielded for defense toward splinters as well as bad weather
and equipped with powered turrets, this modern main gun for
small vessels was equipped on most fleet destroyers.
Due to its low elevation angle, anti-air firing is not its forte.</text>

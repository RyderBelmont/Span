        <text>Franchouchou #1 had some merch for you! She even signed it after the game! There's also a phone number... curious, maybe you should send a text? </text>
        <unlock>Beat Sakura and three other musicians, or at least one other member of Franchouchou. Player does not need to win. </unlock>

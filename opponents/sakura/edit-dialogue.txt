#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

swap_cards=calm,~cards~ feels right...?

okay_hand,marker:sakura_invite=smile,So, why'd everyone come out tonight? I think I can guess, but... you could be like me and walk into the wrong room, right?
okay_hand,marker:sakura_invite=happy,So... I'm usually pretty good with names, but you're all so... unique! What can you tell me about yourselves?
okay_hand=doubt,This hand's just so-so. (<i>Seriously, I had to have taken a wrong turn somewhere, right?</i>)
okay_hand=hum,I can certainly see the appeal of a game like this! Buuuuut, definitely not what I'd do professionally.
bad_hand=why,(<i>I knew it… this is a huge mess!</i>)
bad_hand=ohno,(<i>Keep the lid on the zombie thing… Keep a lid on the whole zombie thing...</i>)
bad_hand=rap,This hand is non<i>sense</i>, if you don't quit it, dealer, I'll shove these cards up your <i>rear end</i>--!

4-good_hand=crush,I... you know, definitely feel excited when I see these cards come out. It's nice to have your pulse pounding with anticipation? (<i>And maybe later...</i>)
4-good_hand=smile,Sorry, everyone, looks like I'm having a lot of trouble staying down.
4-good_hand=sing,Hey, hey, a good hand's here to play~
4-good_hand=happy,Don't give up, everyone! You just gotta dig deep and find that extra bit of strength to keep playing!
4-okay_hand=happy,Not a bad hand! You might beat me this time! (<i>Well, it's a bit different than a <i>typical</i> shoot... but at least I'm not the only one who'd be on display.</i>)
4-okay_hand=calm,It wouldn't be any fun if I won every single time, but... I've got this one in the bag, or maybe not? (<i>It's okay to be wrong <i>sometimes</i>. I'm still human, after all. Er. Well, <i>was</i>.</i>)
4-okay_hand=hum,(<i>This is actually really nice! I wish it wasn't <i>strip</i> poker but... maybe I don't mind that much?</i>)
4-okay_hand=smile,Er... could I... bring back that last card? No...? Well, that's okay.
4-okay_hand=zettai,This hand could go either way, but keep on clawing your way through the barricades in your way!
4-bad_hand=huh,(<i>Maybe this is supposed to be some sort of anatomical study... Anatomical study!? Are you kidding me!? What kind of gig is this!?</i>)
4-bad_hand=why,W-w-w-wait! I need another card! (<i>Any other card!</i>)
4-bad_hand=why,(<i>What do I do what do I do what do I do!?</i>)
4-bad_hand=ohno,At least my reactions are genuine?!
4-bad_hand=doubt,(<i>Well, I <i>do</i> appreciate the spotlight. C'mon, Sakura! Cheer up!</i>)
4-bad_hand=rap,I may be a <i>zombie</i>, but I'm no <i>dummy</i>, I see these cards, and their numbers, and think I'm getting <i>bullied.</i>
4-hand,priority:0=hum,So, I'm not <i>really</i> sure how I got brought back, but it's not so bad. I can still feel, and think, and I don't like, crave flesh or anything!
4-hand,priority:0=crush,I know this is a little weird... but I'm still the same Idol. I wouldn't have gotten to be an Idol if I hadn't gotten brought back.
4-hand,priority:0=huh,I don't eat people, and I'm perfectly clean and not... you know, rotting!
4-hand,priority:0=doubt,So... yeah, I'm a zombie. I don't really get it either, but I promise I'm not one of those movie types! I just... basically got back from the dead!
4-hand,priority:0,marker:itchy_tasty =why,I'm really not one of those "itchy tasty" type zombies.
4-hand,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:zombie_question2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:zombie_question2=rap,The only thing I spit are hot rhymes when I'm mad, Akko! Don't conflate me with those vomity ghouls, I'm not even a little sad!

I love all kinds of idol stuff! It's good to know what's popular. Iron Frill was always my favorite though.
4-hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,marker:+eggplant_wizard=smile,Pit, you look really familiar. I won't push the issue, but are you sure you're not a member of Eggplant Wizard?
4-hand,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:eggplant_wizard==1,marker:+eggplant_wizard=calm,We were talking about Eggplant Wizard, weren't we? They're a really popular group of boys from Ainu! They're more J-pop than idols, I guess.
4-hand,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:eggplant_wizard==2,marker:+eggplant_wizard=sing,Yeah! Eggplant Wizard has the dark, edgy one, Pittoo! He looks sort of like you. Then there's the athlete in green, and the frontman, Colonel Hawk! His Hawk Fist is the band's warcry!
4-hand,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:tstopmeido,marker:sakuya1=smile,It's rude to say so, but yes! She's more intriguing than you are by a lot, Remilia-kun.

I'd love to be able to make more time, but between performing and practicing, the hours just slip away, y'know?
4-hand,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,marker:sakuya_drinks=hum,Sakuya, they serve drinks here. I'm going to buy one for the two of us. What would you like? It's only fair, since Remi-<i>kun</i> is drinking.
4-hand,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:tstopmeido2=doubt,...The drunker you get, the more obnoxious you'll be. Huh, Remilia-<i>kun</i>?
4-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:drinks_anyone,notSaidMarker:sakura_drinks,marker:sakura_drinks=crush,W-well, idols aren't really supposed to drink unless it's for an advertisement... would you buy me... oh... this "Blue Fairy" sounds cute. Do they have a pink version?
4-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:5-8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:3,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_anal,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_anal,notSaidMarker:sakura_butt,marker:sakura_butt=rap,T-things have really changed in a decade! That's... horribly inappropriate! Why would you feel it's okay to ask people that, Sei!? Anyone with respect would say no, anyway!
4-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:4-6,notSaidMarker:jura_flowers,count-amalia:1,marker:jura_flowers=smile,That's adorable! Amalia, I don't suppose I can follow Jura's example and ask for one or two of your spares?
4-hand,notSaidMarker:furanshuu,priority:0,marker:furanshuu=hum,I guess you guys can see me for who I am, so I can talk about our name! Franchouchou sounds really cute, right? But it's also subtly about zombies! 'Furanshuu' is the smell of decay. Um. Not that I smell. I don't smell, right?
4-hand,notSaidMarker:furanshuu,priority:0,marker:furanshuu=hum,So, I know this is a super secret performance, so... I'll tell you a secret about our group name! 'Chouchou' is a cute French word, right? But furanshuu means "rot" in Japanese. Pretty clever, huh?
4-hand,notSaidMarker:furanshuu,priority:0,marker:furanshuu=crush,A lot of idol groups keep their name meaning secret, so let's keep this between us! Furanshuu means decay, y'know, so Franchouchou sounds like a cutesy version of that! ...I thought it was clever, anyway!

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=doubt,For a girl who dresses like an idol, you're kind of a jerk to everyone, Remilia.

-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:2=doubt,...For a girl who dresses like an idol, you sure don't act like one, Remilia. The "brat" role's been dead since the 1990's...

-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=zettai,Don't worry, Sayaka. I had to take off my makeup, so no matter what you look like, it's probably prettier than me!

-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=ohno,Twilight? I know you're a princess, but please try to remain decent!




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt a necromancer, or his nice zombies, right? A-asking for a friend...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2=zettai,That looks so complicated! I bet if it were easy, everyone would do it, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,Um... sorry, no reason. I'm sure you're more used to something like a muse, right...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Franchouchou is kind of... unique... because... um, we're mostly regional idols... so, if we widened our base... we'd just be happy to meet new fans, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2=zettai,That looks so complicated! I bet if it were easy, everyone would do it, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,Um... sorry, no reason. I'm sure you're more used to something like a muse, right...?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Franchouchou is kind of... unique... because... um, we're mostly regional idols... so, if we widened our base... we'd just be happy to meet new fans, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?

2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=huh,Um... it would... complicate... our routines... y-yeah....

2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?

2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt a necromancer, or his nice zombies, right? A-asking for a friend...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?

4-male_removing_accessory=smile,My heart is pounding, so… if you wanted to be a bit reckless, I wouldn’t mind.
4-male_removing_accessory=why,O-oh. I'm surprised you're sticking to small stuff, ~name~! I'd have expected a bit of a bigger play!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=sing,Nice to see another idol here, Pit! And it looks like you brought your fanclub!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
4-male_removed_accessory=crush,It's great to know Franchouchou has such great fans! You're so skilled at cards, so I can only imagine what other stuff you're good at! (<i>Though... if you were good with your hands, that'd be best.</i>)
4-male_removed_accessory=happy,You're playing super well, huh, ~name~? To have something like that as a backup singer?
4-male_removed_accessory=huh,(<i>I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm here, in public, without my makeup, and some guy's just taking off his ~clothing~.</i>)  S-sorry! I was just caught up on your ~clothing~, ~name~!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...

4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie=why,C-could you not, Akko?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
4-female_removed_accessory=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
4-female_removed_accessory=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! (<i>I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!</i>)

5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
5-female_removed_accessory=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
5-female_removed_accessory=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! (<i>I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory=happy,I'm going to keep my ribbons on no matter what, ~name~! So, I think it's amazing of you to take off ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?

6-male_removing_accessory=why,(<i>Oh man. I'm getting my butt kicked...</i>) N-nice ~clothing~, ~name~. Um...
6-male_removing_accessory=huh,Wait a second, you still had your ~clothing~? You didn't bring that back when we weren't looking, right?

6-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
6-male_removed_accessory=rap,~Clothing~, even when an idol is naked? Try it again, guy, and this rapping I won't really be faking.
6-male_removed_accessory=doubt,~Clothing~...? Woo... C'mon, ~name~! Where's your spirit?! Your undying passion!? You can do better than that, can't you?
6-male_removed_accessory=rap,~Name~, Franchouchou's Number One is almost naked. If you only take off your ~clothing~, how can I possibly think you're having fun, and not... shoot! Lost my beat.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...

6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie=why,C-could you not, Akko?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?

6-female_removed_accessory=huh,(<i>Why would I say something like that? I sure as heck don’t know!</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory=doubt,Sorry, ~name~, I'm happy to be playing with you, but your ~clothing~'s a real challenge to get enthusiastic over.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
-3-female_removed_accessory=why,Just a joke! Just a Sakura joke!
-3-female_removed_accessory=huh,(<i>Why would I say something like that? I sure as heck don’t know!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory=doubt,Sorry, ~name~, I'm happy to be playing with you, but your ~clothing~'s a real challenge to get enthusiastic over.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?

-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
-2-male_removed_accessory=zettai,As long as you don't stop there, ~name~! I'm not done yet, so I hope you aren't either!

-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
-1-female_removed_accessory=crush,Well... that wasn't your last item... right? So at least you can keep on going!
-1-female_removed_accessory=hum,(<i>It's just nice that people are treating me like I'm normal!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory=zettai,See it through to the very end, and beyond, if you have to, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_minor=crush,It's not easy being an Idol, and I know I put a lot of work in. But, ~name~ probably spent a lot of time getting his  ~clothing~ ready for the game, too, huh?
male_removing_minor=smile,I really like stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~! But, I'll admit I just feel so dang pretty in my idol gear.
male_removing_minor=hum,Your ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ make|~clothing~ makes)~ me kind of jealous! In Franchouchou, most of our outfits are pretty coordinated.
male_removed_minor=happy,I know Franchouchou's an idol group, but we lean a little bit into heavy metal too! Well, we're great at headbanging, ~name~.
male_removed_minor=calm,Hm? Your ~clothing~? For some reason, I feel like that's something Number Two would wear in her spare time... she's a bit of a rougher, less refined Idol!
male_removed_minor=smile,You know, ~name~, I can't really date, being an Idol and all, but I bet your girlfriend would love to wear your ~clothing~!
female_removing_minor=smile,your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ so neat, ~name~! Maybe I should pick something like that up for myself? It's not like I've got a super expansive set out of outfits, after all.
female_removing_minor=happy,I always really appreciate the kinds of outfits people wear to Franchouchou concerts! ~Name~'s ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ pretty amazing!
female_removing_minor=hum,Hm. Idols are really supposed to keep close to a pattern or uniform, so it's easy to recognize us. But, even so, I'd love to work something like ~name~'s ~clothing~ into my wardrobe!
female_removed_minor=calm,(<i>It <i>would</i> be nice to have some more changes of clothes. Cute ~clothing~, at least.</i>)
female_removed_minor=zettai,Saga's a small province, but I hope we can make up for in spirit! Sort of like how ~name~'s ~clothing~'s probably really important to her!
female_removed_minor=huh,I will say, it's not typical that our fans will undress at our concerts...

0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!

0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=doubt,Sorry, just thinking of all the weird things that can happen...

0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=crush,(<i>We're the relatable ones in our idol groups, Pit, you have to be flexible for the fans.</i>)

0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
0-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
0-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
0-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
0-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
0-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
0-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
0-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
0-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=why,U-uhm. Just... how much makeup I really need to look like this, I suppose.
0-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=smile,I think every body type can be impressive, but most Japanese stores cater to thinner girls, you know, Haru? You have to tell me where you shop!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=doubt,I... don't normally admit this. But I have some rather unpleasant re-birth marks, Kyoko. Um. Birthmarks, I mean!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,If you happened to love singing and dancing, you'd really give me a run for my money...
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!
0-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=happy,Uh, sure sure, Remilia. Um, Sakuya, how'd you do that? That's a super neat trick!
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=zettai,Oh, and by the way, your glasses are super cute, Saki! They really bring out your eyes!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=sing,Don't be shy, Sayaka! We're here to help people, remember...? Though getting to wear cute outfits is a big plus in my book.

2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=hum,Uh huh.
2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=hum,Oh really? I'd bet you'd look good in just about everything.
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=huh,Oh... did you hurt yourself, Ryuji...?
2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=doubt,Sorry, just thinking of all the weird things that can happen...
2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5=crush,You are... almost absurdly good looking, Kamina.

2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smile,Aww, there's nothing wrong with loving idol music, Ryuji! But... I can keep a secret if you're embarrassed.
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
2-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
2-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
2-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)

2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
2-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=why,U-uhm. Just... how much makeup I really need to look like this, I suppose.
2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=smile,I think every body type can be impressive, but most Japanese stores cater to thinner girls, you know, Haru? You have to tell me where you shop!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=doubt,I... don't normally admit this. But I have some rather unpleasant re-birth marks, Kyoko. Um. Birthmarks, I mean!
2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,If you happened to love singing and dancing, you'd really give me a run for my money...
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!
2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=happy,Uh, sure sure, Remilia. Um, Sakuya, how'd you do that? That's a super neat trick!
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=zettai,Oh, and by the way, your glasses are super cute, Saki! They really bring out your eyes!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=sing,Don't be shy, Sayaka! We're here to help people, remember...? Though getting to wear cute outfits is a big plus in my book.

4-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!

#lost dress
5-male_removing_minor=crush,Fashion's always been kind of a weak spot for me. I wouldn't have expected ~name~'s stuff to look so cool! Back when I died, you'd have been even more of a trendsetter.
5-male_removing_minor=smile,So... I was in the best shape of my life right before <i>you know</i>, so ~name~'s ~clothing~ would actually look real cute on me!
5-male_removing_minor=why,Y-you aren't just picking your ~clothing~ because you're afraid of me, or something, right, ~name~?
5-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=hum,Oh really? I bet Natsuki and Akko-chan have some suggestions for things they'd like to dress you in.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0=huh,O-oh! I just meant the rebellious types usually prefer Number Two. In Franchouchou... my idol group.
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=why,O-oh! A-as zombies, we're never supposed to unwind our bandages...
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=why,T-the bandages again!
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=hum,Uh huh.
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
5-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=hum,Oh really? I'd bet you'd look good in just about everything.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=huh,Oh... did you hurt yourself, Ryuji...?
5-male_removed_minor=doubt,Even though I get to be an idol, sometimes I get <i>super</i> jealous. When you're an Idol, there's all these rules you have to follow. An uh, when you're undead, I guess.
5-male_removed_minor=happy,If the whole "secret zombie" thing wasn't... y'know, a secret, I'd still love to take a picture with you, ~name~!
5-male_removed_minor=zettai,The way I look at it, you stop living only when you stop caring! And trust me when I say that I, and all of Franchouchou, care a lot! Even about stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~!
5-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=doubt,Sorry, just thinking of all the weird things that can happen...
5-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5=crush,You are... almost absurdly good looking, Kamina.
5-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
5-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=crush,(<i>We're the relatable ones in our idol groups, Pit, you have to be flexible for the fans.</i>)
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smile,Aww, there's nothing wrong with loving idol music, Ryuji! But... I can keep a secret if you're embarrassed.
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
5-female_removing_minor=smile,Aww, don't worry, ~name~! Let me get you a Franchouchou shirt or jacket to replace your ~clothing~. Promise!
5-female_removing_minor=doubt,It'll be okay, ~name~! Don't give up...! (<i>I want to be enthusiastic! I really do! I just... just her ~clothing~?!</i>)
5-female_removing_minor=zettai,I know you can't put your ~clothing~ back on, ~name~, but it'll come back at the end of the game. Amazing how that works, right?
5-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
5-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
5-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
5-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
5-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
5-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
5-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
5-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
5-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
5-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
5-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
5-female_removed_minor=crush,Don't worry, ~name~! Seriously! I have the worst luck in the world, but you're still breathing! Don't give up!
5-female_removed_minor=happy,I know I'm a little... different looking! But I think that helps ~name~'s beauty stand out-- especially without her ~clothing~!
5-female_removed_minor=sing,It's the Legendary ~name~ and her Legendary ~Clothing~! See, ~name~? Everyone's got <i>some</i> sort of legend to them!
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
5-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!
5-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!

-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?

-3-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!

-3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=happy,Your ~clothing~’s quite a thrill, ~name~!
male_removing_major=sing,You know, it’s impossible to never lose! But if you act as a bright example to others, is it really so bad?
male_removing_major=smile,I'm not super competive but it's like, 'hey, hello, ~name~'s ~clothing~ is coming off, and I can't not get excited' y'know?
male_removed_major=hum,You're pretty cute, ~name~! I bet the ladies--or boys--can't keep their hands off you!
male_removed_major=huh,That was... super really dang quick! You aren't trying to get naked... uh, are you?
male_removed_major=crush,That was a pretty big play, ~name~! I'm glad I've never had a wardrobe malfunction like that... (<i>But, people love to eat up those videos on idols making mistakes...</i>)
female_removing_major=huh,(<i>Whoa! She's taking off her ~clothing~! All eyes are on her! Even mine!</i>) G-good job, ~name~! Um. Just... s-stay confident!
female_removing_major=hum,You can just reach for your next goal, ~name~!
female_removing_major=zettai,I know it's something big, but it takes a lot of guts and nerve to take that off! Show us your stuff, ~name~, even if it's literally your stuff!
female_removed_major=happy,Even though your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ gone, we can keep your spirit up together, ~name~! Keep getting back up, and don't lose your head!
female_removed_major=happy,You know what they say, the wind is always blowing from somewhere, no matter what! So catch a hold of that wind and let it carry you!
female_removed_major=smile,I might be a little... mortally challenged, but I'm still a <i>little</i> fashionable. And I can tell ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~ was really special!

0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=why,I hate guns. Please. Please, never, ever do that again!
0-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
0-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
0-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
0-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)

0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...

0-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!

0-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
0-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
0-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
0-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?

2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,You're really lucky to have someone that gets to--wants to--undress you, Crown Prince...
2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=huh,"Her?"
2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01,targetSayingMarker:Undies02=ohno,O-Oh! You <i>were</i> a woman! I didn't want to assume---
2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
2-female_removed_major=smile,Don't worry, ~name~! ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~ was probably just weighing you down! You're still really in this! Franchouchou Number One has your back!
2-female_removed_major=happy,It’s a little unreasonable to get a hand without a scratch. Um, in life, in poker, or in… other ways!
2-female_removed_major=doubt,(<i>Is she really...? I mean, it's <i>so</i> early! I'm not used to this sort of performance.</i>) Kind of a struggle for you, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=why,I hate guns. Please. Please, never, ever do that again!
2-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
2-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
2-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=why,Um... don't take this the wrong way... but... your scar tissue actually looks really unique and cool...
2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=hum,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still kicking your butt!
2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=smile,(<i>That's <i>it!?</i></i>) I-if I were you, Misato, I wouldn"t worry too much about your scar. Lots of people have it <i>way</i> worse...
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=ohno,S-Sayaka, you can't just flash people like that! Oh no!
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...

3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
3-male_removed_major=hum,I was like <i>oh no my makeup</i>! And then he was like "oh hey don't worry my ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ are|~clothing~'s)~ coming off!"
3-male_removed_major=sing,Never gonna stop, so gotta proceed, and keep going! I’m giving it my all, ~name~!
3-male_removed_major=ohno,(<i>W-wow! It's nice to have male fans, but he's really something!</i>)
3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
3-female_removing_major=hum,With ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~|a ~clothing~)~ like that, I wouldn't have figured you were into idol stuff. It's pretty cool, just... maybe more practical than I was expecting?
3-female_removing_major=sing,Well, I’d tell you to wish for it, but… I’m not really here to sing <i>Mezame returner,</i> um. Yet, anyway!
3-female_removing_major=zettai,Look at me, ~name~! I haven't given up yet, and neither should you! (<i>I may be nervous, but I'm not letting her down! That's a Franchouchou Saga promise!</i>)

3-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!

3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)

4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
4-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
4-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
4-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
4-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
4-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
4-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
4-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
4-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=hum,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still kicking your butt!
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
4-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
4-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=ohno,S-Sayaka, you can't just flash people like that! Oh no!
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...


#lost dress
5-male_removing_major=zettai,I'm max hyped for this!
5-male_removing_major=sing,Let your flag fly high!
5-male_removing_major=crush,Aww, c'mon, ~name~, at least you knew you'd be getting naked tonight!
5-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
5-male_removed_major=hum,I was like <i>oh no my makeup</i>! And then he was like "oh hey don't worry my ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ are|~clothing~'s)~)~ coming off!"
5-male_removed_major=sing,Never gonna stop, so gotta proceed, and keep going! I’m giving it my all, ~name~!
5-male_removed_major=ohno,(<i>W-wow! It's nice to have male fans, but he's really something!</i>)
5-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
5-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
5-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
5-female_removing_major=hum,With ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~|a ~clothing~)~ like that, I wouldn't have figured you were into idol stuff. It's pretty cool, just... maybe more practical than I was expecting?
5-female_removing_major=sing,Well, I’d tell you to wish for it, but… I’m not really here to sing <i>Mezame returner,</i> um. Yet, anyway!
5-female_removing_major=zettai,Look at me, ~name~! I haven't given up yet, and neither should you! (<i>I may be nervous, but I'm not letting her down! That's a Franchouchou Saga promise!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
5-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
5-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
5-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes, I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
5-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
5-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
5-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
5-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
5-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
5-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
5-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
5-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
5-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,You're really lucky to have someone that gets to--wants to--undress you, Crown Prince...
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=huh,"Her?"

5-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?

6-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
6-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
6-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
6-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
6-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
6-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
6-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
6-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
6-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
6-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
6-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=rap,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still in this!
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
6-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
6-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
6-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
6-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
6-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
6-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
6-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
6-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:10=why,S-so many bra malfunctions tonight...
6-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
6-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...

-3-male_removing_major=happy,~Clothing~? That <i>has</i> to be a relief to get off. I know I <i>love</i> my show outfits. But... they're fun to take off too.
-3-male_removing_major=crush,S-so, you can see me, ~name~. Do you wanna show off for Number One?
-3-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
-3-male_removed_major=smile,The first rule of being an idol is to get people excited and keep them happy. You're r-really doing that for me, ~name~!
-3-male_removed_major=sing,The Legendary ~Name~'s Legendary ~Clothing~! If we did have a song, what would it be about, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_major=huh,Hm! Don't be shy, ~name~! I'm... um... already more undressed than you, y-you know!
-3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
-3-female_removing_major=smile,A little bit of this, a little bit of ~clothing.ifPlural(those|her)~ ~clothing~, and it'll all be okay, right?
-3-female_removing_major=smile,I might be a little... different, but as an idol and as your friend, ~name~, there's no way I'm going to let you get down about this!
-3-female_removing_major=zettai,Take off whatever you want, ~name~! But even if it's your ~clothing~! You have to keep on your bright smile and excited eyes!

I wonder what she meant...=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
-3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
-3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
-3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
-3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!

-3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...

-3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?

-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...

-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=rap,Well, I may be down... well, I may be out! Um! I'm not defeated in spirit, Your Grace!
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
-2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
-2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:10=why,S-so many bra malfunctions tonight...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...


#finished
-1-male_removing_major=zettai,If you want an encore, ~name~, you're gonna need to cheer louder!
-1-male_removing_major=smile,K-kinda a shame we can't put stuff on 'til everyone's done.
-1-male_removing_major=zettai,Encore, encore, encore!
-1-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
-1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
-1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
-1-male_removed_major=happy,There we go, ~name~! That's what I like to see!
-1-male_removed_major=hum,You got <i>this</i> idol's pulse moving, ~name~...
-1-male_removed_major=crush,S-say, after this, could I borrow your ~clothing~? I just... n-nevermind.
-1-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
-1-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
-1-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
-1-female_removing_major=happy,I wasn't planning on this when I came in today, but this is definitely a new kind of inspring!
-1-female_removing_major=calm,Hm... (<i>I wonder what she's wearing under that? Stuff's changed a bunch since the late 00's, so maybe...?</i>)
-1-female_removing_major=zettai,Step out your ~clothing~ and step up to the challenge! You're still in this, ~name~, so don't back down!
-1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
-1-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
-1-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
-1-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes, I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
-1-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
-1-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
-1-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
-1-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
-1-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
-1-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
-1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
-1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,You're really lucky to have someone that gets to--wants to--undress you, Crown Prince...
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=huh,"Her?"
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01,targetSayingMarker:Undies02=ohno,O-Oh! You <i>were</i> a woman! I didn't want to assume---
-1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
-1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
-1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
-1-female_removed_major=smile,I-I wasn't staring! I was-- keeping a keen eye! Just to make sure you didn't need more encouragement!
-1-female_removed_major=huh,W-wow! So that's the style these days, huh?
-1-female_removed_major=crush,I could never pull off something that cute, ~name~...
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
-1-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
-1-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
-1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
-1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
-1-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
-1-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.

male_chest_will_be_visible=why,(<i>He's already taking off his ~clothing~?! Really!? This is r-really lewd for an idol!</i>)
male_chest_is_visible=smile,Well, I <i>guess</i> for men, it's pretty easy to just show off your chest. I'm certainly enjoying the view.
male_chest_is_visible=smile,You've got a nice build, ~name~, but I hope this means you'll want to put on some Franchouchou gear later.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=why,I-I understand it's... certainly... um... (<i>What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?</i>)
male_crotch_will_be_visible=huh,Is--is he really taking out his--

female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,That was fast... um... you do realize that I'm an idol, not a rock star, right, ~name~?
female_small_chest_is_visible=why,This feels... very lewd, for some reason.
female_small_chest_is_visible=zettai,They say that large breasts fill your hand, but small ones fill your heart!
female_medium_chest_is_visible=hum,U-um. Those look great! A-and kind of unique. To me, anyway. Most of us in Franchouchou are either smaller or bigger, s-so...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=huh,W-wow! ~Name~, those are just about the perfect size and shape... (<i>Would it have <i>killed</i> Kotaro to shape me up a bit when he brought me back?</i>)
female_large_chest_is_visible=doubt,I don't think having a large bust is all it's cracked up to be. Like, it's really nice in some ways, but you're always jiggly, and random people are always staring...
female_large_chest_is_visible=huh,I... it's like looking into a mirror. After putting on makeup... huh.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=why,Seriously? She's going to?

2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=crush,This is a little private, but since ~name~'s showing hers... I used to do that for a long while. It just... feels a lot nicer, to be honest.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=crush,Well, since ~name~'s brave enough to show us her... <i>anatomy</i>, I guess I can affirm her by saying I used to trim that too. It stops it from being so <i>bushy</i>, right?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:akko=zettai,Even though you're out of clothes, you're at max cute, and I'm at max hype, Akko!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria=crush,It's okay to be a little turned on. I think we're all a little turned on. (<i>I'm definitely a little turned on.</i>)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=smile,You know, I bet Number Four... Junko... would go about this the same way you do, Futaba. Terribly cute.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hanako=hum,For some reason, I suppose I was expecting more maintainance...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru=why,H-Haru-san, I think your dirty talk is really working. It's just working on the wrong person...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Aww, don't be ashamed! Red hair's super pretty and it looks great on you! I don't think anyone who you wanted to see you naked'd care much.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>But I suppose she could say the same about me!</i>) A-Ai-chan! Where's your hair!? It's so detailed b-but...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=sing,I'll always have a soft spot for a girls with a courage to show their... soft spots! Mahiru's an auteur at heart, it seems!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=zettai,It's the Legendary Crown Prince Miko!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=smile,W-wow, that sure looks... y-you've really... practiced... um... lots! (<i>Phew! If it comes to that, at least Moon's... setting the bar low. Six feet under low.</i>)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=why,O-oh! Well... um. Your looks... like mine, but with brown hair, and mine's got pink hair, and... (<i>I've heard of going out on a limb for a fan, but...</i>)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=huh,I'm... really seeing this, aren't I? W-well, I guess I should do <i>something</i> to make it up to you, Palutena... maybe a song...?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=rap,Obviously, you wouldn't wear panties under a leotard. That'd just be silly! It'd ride up and look really stupid. Not to mention, uncomfortable!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=why,T-they're not especially dangerous, but they are especially scary... are you all okay?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=why,Meia! Revy! Stop it! Franchouchou isn't about violence!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=huh,O-oh. Is shaving that common, now?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=huh,W-Wow! You're really toned. I guess that witch fighting is a great workout.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=huh,I-I guess if it makes you happy... I... I just... what? (<i>What do I... do I need to watch over her?</i>)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3=doubt,Sorry Twilight... I guess where you're from, this is normal... I'll... stop badgering you over it. (<i>Even Tae listens! She's so weird! Very cute and nice! But so weird!!</i>)


#lost makeup
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=huh,O-oh, he's going to...? (<i>I guess it's pretty easy for guys...</i>)
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=zettai,This is gonna be awesome! I can feel it!
3-male_chest_is_visible=sing,Careful, ~name~, we wouldn't want your heart to beat out of your chest or anything like that!
3-male_chest_is_visible=smile,Wow! You're even cuter than I expected! I could just rest my head on you and feel so safe! Well, the rest of me too, just to be clear.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=hum,Idols really work for their figures too, ~name~! Well, living ones, anyway. (<i>I wonder if he's got a lot of endurance, or that's all for show?</i>)
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=smile,You must work for your figure. Though, as a guy, you'd probably rather I tell you how ripped you look, huh? Well, I'm glad <i>you're</i> ripped, and not... um, ripping.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=hum,Wow! It's nice to see someone with a more cushy body. It seems like everyone in the idol industry is whip-thin or super jacked. But, someone with a little extra just sounds <i>perfect</i> to snuggle.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=smile,Aww, don't be so self conscious! I bet you're really comfy to snuggle. Plus, who doesn't love to snack a little bit? I know I have a <i>huge</i> sweet tooth.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,priority:0=crush,W-wow! You're really strong, ~name~! We only have a few fans with your build, but there's no reason you can't be cute <i>and</i> bulky, y'know?
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,priority:0=hum,I'm surprised how many Franchouchou fans are super strong, like ~name~! (<i>I <i>think</i> he'd have to be really gentle with me. No sense in being broken apart during...</i>)
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=huh,Are you really an angel? That makes me feel a lot less weird about the zombie thing. Buuut I'd rather have been an angel than a zombie.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,Well... yes, I'm a little curious what you look like, ~name~...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smile,I just want to confirm something...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=smile,You're really good with your mouth, huh, Kamina?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=smile,I'm sure you're very impressive! I know at least one girl who's really excited to see you...
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:2small=huh,W-well, I can honestly say that I... I've never seen one like <i>that.</i>
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:2small=doubt,Um... good for you, ~name~?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=crush,S-so, ~name~, is... is <i>that</i> because of me...? I-I sure hope it is.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=hum,I bet you get a lot of compliments, ~name~. But I'm much more of a "show, don't tell," type of girl.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=sing,Looks like you're going to have to really practice your endurance tonight, Pit!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=sing,Well, that girl is me, and I'm happy for it!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=zettai,Well, I always tell my fans to celebrate their best assets. I'm sure you have quite the personality to match <i>that</i>, ~name~.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=crush,That's a really big and impressive… thing... I bet you'd really need someone durable to take all of it though...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=zettai,I mean, you're good at running your mouth! So let's see you put your... <i>feelings</i> where your actions are!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,You'd really be surprised how many people expect Franchouchou to flash them. Looks like you're idol-tier in terms of looks, ~name~!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,If it makes you feel better, ~name~, I'm sure yours won't be all that different from mine.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:akko=smile,Getting really strappy, aren't you, Akko?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria=crush,Whoever they are, I'm sure they'll appreciate you regardless of the size of your breasts.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=smile,Her name... w-well, she goes by Number Four. She's a lot like you, and she's got the best voice of the group!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hanako=zettai,You can do it, Hanako! Go for it! Absolutely!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=ohno,S-sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt your intimate moment!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:ini_personality=why,T-that said, it's not good to break character, Ini... but I guess if we're all keeping secrets...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=why,She's... you're... really... aggressive about this, aren't you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=smile,I think everyone will be too busy watching, Mahiru...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=zettai,I'm glad we agree, no matter how big your chest is, it's your heart--
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=huh,Is... is that a no?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ahhh! (<i>Whatever it is, it's not going to be good!</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=smile,It must be nice to be able to get tan lines...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=crush,I'd ask someone else in Franchouchou... but is it true that having a small chest makes them more sensitive? (<i>It would explain why Junko gets so... nervous sometimes!</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=hum,They're so cute! To be honest, being kind of... busty can be a hassle. (<i>Or a handful, depending on your outlook...</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria=rap,Okay, seriously, Catria, it's the size of your heart that matters! But... you have an incredible butt! It's amazing, use your butt, Catria! Listen to your heart but use your butt!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>Of course they're damn cute! She's a hologram! Or an AI! Or something! How am I supposed to compete with that?!</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=why,--y-your heart that... Your... your wife's breasts. O-of course... Your Grace.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,I guess I was a little surprised-- yours are really cute! If I do get naked later, I'd be... um, happy to compare?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=zettai,I'm a bit jealous! You're so put-together. N-not that you were built to be that way. Or that I was. I'm all my original parts. You're cute, ~name~, that's all!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hanako=why,<i>No fair!</i> They're so cute!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Ini, it's okay if that role is sort of dumb... but you don't need to be mean. We played along, after all.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=zettai,Don't be shy! Your freckles look adorable, Mahiru! Unless you meant your... size, I guess?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=zettai,Don't be sorry, Nagisa! Even with tears in your eyes, you made it through! Don't worry! I believe in you, and the friendship you're doing this for! That's all anyone can ask!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=smile,Don't worry, Saki, they're beautiful, just like the rest of you! (<i>Now there's a statement I really never expected to need to say to </i>my<i> Saki.</i>)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=huh,I... I guess if you know what you're doing... it's just...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy,Wow! They're so full and plump! I know a lot of the other idols in Franchouchou would be jealous!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=zettai,Don't worry, ~name~! Your idol's got the same build, so don't get discouraged!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=crush,Um... Haru, you're really going to have teach a pure and decent idol some of your skills... it's only fair, you're getting a private concert....
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddesses don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? (<i>So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i></i>)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_there=why,I-I'm not staring like I'm <i>attracted</i>. You're just... w-with no bra, do you have something magic to stop your back from hurting?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=huh,It could be worse, ~name~! You could have given away a big secret or something... oh. I see.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smile,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure you look wonderful!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:akko=huh,I know we're about to see her naked but... Akko, are these... s-supposed to make me feel so... lewd?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=zettai,Just keep it together, Catria! I'm sure <i>you</i> will look just as sweet at the rest of your body!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=doubt,...You're less like Junko than I expected-- I-I mean, Number Four!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hanako=crush,N-no, Hanako, I bet people are actually really excited. I bet it'll be just  like the rest of you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=crush,(<i>She's so confident with her body! What I wouldn't give to </i>do<i> w-what</i>?)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:butt=doubt,Ini... I'm so sorry. But... this is kind of what happens when you play games like this. I'll still support you, though... as an idol...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=hum,That seems like... common sense, right?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=hum,(<i>Pretty naughty, getting to see the illusive Kizuna Ai, naked...</i>)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=why,Huh? D-do girls do that? Give away their underwear? (<i>I... if someone gave me their boxers as sleepwear. If we were dating... that's one thing, but what would you do with another girl's panties?</i>)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=smile,Um... if it makes you feel better, you're really... womanly!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=crush,P-promise you won't strike us blind? I know some spirits are known for that...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ah! Those were real knives!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=crush,I've got your back. I promise.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=why,Twilight! You can't just remove your panties first! That's-- that's terribly lewd! Everyone can see your pubic hair! And your--
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=rap,Are you trying to embarrass yourself?! Are you clueless or what!?
3-female_crotch_is_visible=zettai,You're just in your birthday suit! And as far as I know, that's one of the best outfits ever!
3-female_crotch_is_visible=sing,Aww, don't get self-conscious ~name~! Be like an idol! Embrace it, and make me proud!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=doubt,Things sure have changed in the last decade or so, huh...? (<i>Isn't that... a little immature?</i>)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=why,O-oh! I-- w-wow, ~name~, that's quite the statement. You being shaved and all. I'm... feeling self-conscious now.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=hum,That <i>does</i> look really neat. I like how you trimmed your hair, ~name~! (<i>Even if it doesn't grow back, would it be so awful to feel cute, even just for me?</i>)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=happy,<i>So cute, ~name~!</i> That was definitely the style before I died. I... couldn't tell you about the other idols, though!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:akko=zettai,Even though you're out of clothes, you're at max cute, and I'm at max hype, Akko!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria=crush,It's okay to be a little turned on. I think we're all a little turned on. (<i>I'm definitely a little turned on.</i>)

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ahhh! (<i>Whatever it is, it's not going to be good!</i>)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=smile,It must be nice to be able to get tan lines...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=crush,I'd ask someone else in Franchouchou... but is it true that having a small chest makes them more sensitive? (<i>It would explain why Junko gets so... nervous sometimes!</i>)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=hum,They're so cute! To be honest, being kind of... busty can be a hassle. (<i>Or a handful, depending on your outlook...</i>)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria=rap,Okay, seriously, Catria, it's the size of your heart that matters! But... you have an incredible butt! It's amazing, use your butt, Catria! Listen to your heart but use your butt!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>Of course they're damn cute! She's a hologram! Or an AI! Or something! How am I supposed to compete with that?!</i>)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=why,--y-your heart that... Your... your wife's breasts. O-of course... Your Grace.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,I guess I was a little surprised-- yours are really cute! If I do get naked later, I'd be... um, happy to compare?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=zettai,I'm a bit jealous! You're so put-together. N-not that you were built to be that way. Or that I was. I'm all my original parts. You're cute, ~name~, that's all!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hanako=why,<i>No fair!</i> They're so cute!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Ini, it's okay if that role is sort of dumb... but you don't need to be mean. We played along, after all.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=zettai,Don't be shy! Your freckles look adorable, Mahiru! Unless you meant your... size, I guess?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=zettai,Don't be sorry, Nagisa! Even with tears in your eyes, you made it through! Don't worry! I believe in you, and the friendship you're doing this for! That's all anyone can ask!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=smile,Don't worry, Saki, they're beautiful, just like the rest of you! (<i>Now there's a statement I really never expected to need to say to </i>my<i> Saki.</i>)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=huh,I... I guess if you know what you're doing... it's just...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy,Wow! They're so full and plump! I know a lot of the other idols in Franchouchou would be jealous!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=zettai,Don't worry, ~name~! Your idol's got the same build, so don't get discouraged!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=crush,Um... Haru, you're really going to have teach a pure and decent idol some of your skills... it's only fair, you're getting a private concert....
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddesses don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? (<i>So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i></i>)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_there=why,I-I'm not staring like I'm <i>attracted</i>. You're just... w-with no bra, do you have something magic to stop your back from hurting?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=huh,It could be worse, ~name~! You could have given away a big secret or something... oh. I see.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smile,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure you look wonderful!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:akko=huh,I know we're about to see her naked but... Akko, are these... s-supposed to make me feel so... lewd?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=zettai,Just keep it together, Catria! I'm sure <i>you</i> will look just as sweet at the rest of your body!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=doubt,...You're less like Junko than I expected-- I-I mean, Number Four!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hanako=crush,N-no, Hanako, I bet people are actually really excited. I bet it'll be just  like the rest of you.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=crush,(<i>She's so confident with her body! What I wouldn't give to </i>do<i> w-what</i>?)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:butt=doubt,Ini... I'm so sorry. But... this is kind of what happens when you play games like this. I'll still support you, though... as an idol...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=hum,That seems like... common sense, right?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=hum,(<i>Pretty naughty, getting to see the illusive Kizuna Ai, naked...</i>)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=why,Huh? D-do girls do that? Give away their underwear? (<i>I... if someone gave me their boxers as sleepwear. If we were dating... that's one thing, but what would you do with another girl's panties?</i>)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=smile,Um... if it makes you feel better, you're really... womanly!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=crush,P-promise you won't strike us blind? I know some spirits are known for that...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ah! Those were real knives!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=crush,I've got your back. I promise.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=why,Twilight! You can't just remove your panties first! That's-- that's terribly lewd! Everyone can see your pubic hair! And your--
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=rap,Are you trying to embarrass yourself?! Are you clueless or what!?
4-female_crotch_is_visible=zettai,You're just in your birthday suit! And as far as I know, that's one of the best outfits ever!
4-female_crotch_is_visible=sing,Aww, don't get self-conscious ~name~! Be like an idol! Embrace it, and make me proud!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=doubt,Things sure have changed in the last decade or so, huh...? (<i>Isn't that... a little immature?</i>)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=why,O-oh! I-- w-wow, ~name~, that's quite the statement. You being shaved and all. I'm... feeling self-conscious now.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=hum,That <i>does</i> look really neat. I like how you trimmed your hair, ~name~! (<i>Even if it doesn't grow back, would it be so awful to feel cute, even just for me?</i>)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=happy,<i>So cute, ~name~!</i> That was definitely the style before I died. I... couldn't tell you about the other idols, though!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:akko=zettai,Even though you're out of clothes, you're at max cute, and I'm at max hype, Akko!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria=crush,It's okay to be a little turned on. I think we're all a little turned on. (<i>I'm definitely a little turned on.</i>)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=smile,You know, I bet Number Four... Junko... would go about this the same way you do, Futaba. Terribly cute.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hanako=hum,For some reason, I suppose I was expecting more maintainance...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru=why,H-Haru-san, I think your dirty talk is really working. It's just working on the wrong person...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Aww, don't be ashamed! Red hair's super pretty and it looks great on you! I don't think anyone who you wanted to see you naked'd care much.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>But I suppose she could say the same about me!</i>) A-Ai-chan! Where's your hair!? It's so detailed b-but...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=sing,I'll always have a soft spot for a girls with a courage to show their... soft spots! Mahiru's an auteur at heart, it seems!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=zettai,It's the Legendary Crown Prince Miko!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=smile,W-wow, that sure looks... y-you've really... practiced... um... lots! (<i>I may be undead, but I make sure to be... not decayed.</i>)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=why,O-oh! Well... um. Your looks... like mine, but with brown hair, and mine's got pink hair, and... (<i>I've heard of going out on a limb for a fan, but...</i>)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=huh,I'm... really seeing this, aren't I? W-well, I guess I should do <i>something</i> to make it up to you, Palutena... maybe a song...?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=rap,Obviously, you wouldn't wear panties under a leotard. That'd just be silly! It'd ride up and look really stupid. Not to mention, uncomfortable!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=why,T-they're not especially dangerous, but they are especially scary... are you all okay?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=why,Meia! Revy! Stop it! Franchouchou isn't about violence!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=huh,O-oh. Is shaving that common, now?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=huh,W-Wow! You're really toned. I guess that witch fighting is a great workout.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=huh,I-I guess if it makes you happy... I... I just... what? (<i>What do I... do I need to watch over her?</i>)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3=doubt,Sorry Twilight... I guess where you're from, this is normal... I'll... stop badgering you over it. (<i>Even Tae listens! She's so weird! Very cute and nice! But so weird!!</i>)

5-male_chest_will_be_visible=huh,O-oh, he's going to...? (<i>I guess it's pretty easy for guys...</i>)
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=zettai,This is gonna be awesome! I can feel it!
5-male_chest_is_visible=sing,Careful, ~name~, we wouldn't want your heart to beat out of your chest or anything like that!
5-male_chest_is_visible=smile,Wow! You're even cuter than I expected! I could just rest my head on you and feel so safe! Well, the rest of me too, just to be clear.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=hum,Idols really work for their figures too, ~name~! Well, living ones, anyway. (<i>I wonder if he's got a lot of endurance, or that's all for show?</i>)
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=smile,You must work for your figure. Though, as a guy, you'd probably rather I tell you how ripped you look, huh? Well, I'm glad <i>you're</i> ripped, and not... um, ripping.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=hum,Wow! It's nice to see someone with a more cushy body. It seems like everyone in the idol industry is whip-thin or super jacked. But, someone with a little extra just sounds <i>perfect</i> to snuggle.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=smile,Aww, don't be so self conscious! I bet you're really comfy to snuggle. Plus, who doesn't love to snack a little bit? I know I have a <i>huge</i> sweet tooth.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,priority:0=crush,W-wow! You're really strong, ~name~! We only have a few fans with your build, but there's no reason you can't be cute <i>and</i> bulky, y'know?
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,priority:0=hum,I'm surprised how many Franchouchou fans are super strong, like ~name~! (<i>I <i>think</i> he'd have to be really gentle with me. No sense in being broken apart during...</i>)
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=huh,Are you really an angel? That makes me feel a lot less weird about the zombie thing. Buuut I'd rather have been an angel than a zombie.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,Well... yes, I'm a little curious what you look like, ~name~...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smile,I just want to confirm something...

5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:2small=huh,W-well, I can honestly say that I... I've never seen one like <i>that.</i>
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:2small=doubt,Um... good for you, ~name~?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=crush,S-so, ~name~, is... is <i>that</i> because of me...? I-I sure hope it is.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=hum,I bet you get a lot of compliments, ~name~. But I'm much more of a "show, don't tell," type of girl.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1=sing,Looks like you're going to have to really practice your endurance tonight, Pit!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=sing,Well, that girl is me, and I'm happy for it!
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=zettai,Well, I always tell my fans to celebrate their best assets. I'm sure you have quite the personality to match <i>that</i>, ~name~.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=crush,That's a really big and impressive… thing... I bet you'd really need someone durable to take all of it though...
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=zettai,I mean, you're good at running your mouth! So let's see you put your... <i>feelings</i> where your actions are!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,You'd really be surprised how many people expect Franchouchou to flash them. Looks like you're idol-tier in terms of looks, ~name~!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,If it makes you feel better, ~name~, I'm sure yours won't be all that different from mine.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:akko=smile,Getting really strappy, aren't you, Akko?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria=crush,Whoever they are, I'm sure they'll appreciate you regardless of the size of your breasts.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=smile,Her name... w-well, she goes by Number Four. She's a lot like you, and she's got the best voice of the group!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hanako=zettai,You can do it, Hanako! Go for it! Absolutely!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=ohno,S-sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt your intimate moment!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:ini_personality=why,T-that said, it's not good to break character, Ini... but I guess if we're all keeping secrets...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=why,She's... you're... really... aggressive about this, aren't you?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=smile,I think everyone will be too busy watching, Mahiru...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=zettai,I'm glad we agree, no matter how big your chest is, it's your heart--

5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=rap,Obviously, you wouldn't wear panties under a leotard. That'd just be silly! It'd ride up and look really stupid. Not to mention, uncomfortable!

6-male_chest_will_be_visible=sing,Gonna follow my example, ~name~? That's about the highest flattery you can give someone like me!

6-male_chest_is_visible=crush,I don't really have many chances to compiment my fans on their bodies... but can you tell that I like yours, ~name~?
6-male_chest_is_visible=doubt,You're really handsome, ~name~! But I'm just... I know it's kind of a joke that girls look different without makeup, but I'm kind of a new extreme, aren't I?
6-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=hum,Idols really work for their figures too, ~name~! Well, living ones, anyway. (<i>I wonder if he's got a lot of endurance, or that's all for show?</i>)
6-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=smile,You must work for your figure. Though, as a guy, you'd probably rather I tell you how ripped you look, huh? Well, I'm glad <i>you're</i> ripped, and not... um, ripping.
6-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=hum,Wow! It's nice to see someone with a more cushy body. It seems like everyone in the idol industry is whip-thin or super jacked. But, someone with a little extra just sounds <i>perfect</i> to snuggle.
6-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=smile,Aww, don't be so self conscious! I bet you're really comfy to snuggle. Plus, who doesn't love to snack a little bit? I know I have a <i>huge</i> sweet tooth.

6-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=sing,Well, that girl is me, and I'm happy for it!
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=hum,It must be hard to get a date with something that big, ~name~! Or maybe it's really easy...?
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible=crush,That's a really big and impressive… thing... I bet you'd need someone to use two hands... and her mouth... and her breasts... to really satisfy you, huh?
6-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=zettai,I mean, you're good at running your mouth! So let's see you put your... <i>feelings</i> where your actions are!

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:akko=smile,Getting really strappy, aren't you, Akko?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria=crush,Whoever they are, I'm sure they'll appreciate you regardless of the size of your breasts.

6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hanako=zettai,You can do it, Hanako! Go for it! Absolutely!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=ohno,S-sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt your intimate moment!
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:ini_personality=why,T-that said, it's not good to break character, Ini... but I guess if we're all keeping secrets...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=why,She's... you're... really... aggressive about this, aren't you?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=smile,I think everyone will be too busy watching, Mahiru...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=zettai,I'm glad we agree, no matter how big your chest is, it's your heart--
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=huh,Is... is that a no?
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ahhh! (<i>Whatever it is, it's not going to be good!</i>)
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=smile,It must be nice to be able to get tan lines...
6-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=crush,You look so graceful... I get kind of self conscious about my chest. Sure, it's not <i>huge</i>, but... there's lots of motion in dancing.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible=zettai,Your nipples really complete your look! I bet they're fun to play wi-- um! Carry on! (<i>Why would I say that!?</i>)
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria=rap,Okay, seriously, Catria, it's the size of your heart that matters! But... you have an incredible butt! It's amazing, use your butt, Catria! Listen to your heart but use your butt!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>Of course they're damn cute! She's a hologram! Or an AI! Or something! How am I supposed to compete with that?!</i>)
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=why,--y-your heart that... Your... your wife's breasts. O-of course... Your Grace.
6-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=sing,At first I was gonna be all "Aahh! Are those real!" and then I was going to be all "Oh of course they are," but then I was like "Oh yeah, just compliment her."
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible=zettai,You look beautiful, ~name~! So flushed with life, and ready to turn this game around!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hanako=why,<i>No fair!</i> They're so cute!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Ini, it's okay if that role is sort of dumb... but you don't need to be mean. We played along, after all.
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=zettai,Don't be shy! Your freckles look adorable, Mahiru! Unless you meant your... size, I guess?
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=zettai,Don't be sorry, Nagisa! Even with tears in your eyes, you made it through! Don't worry! I believe in you, and the friendship you're doing this for! That's all anyone can ask!
6-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=smile,Don't worry, Saki, they're beautiful, just like the rest of you! (<i>Now there's a statement I really never expected to need to say to </i>my<i> Saki.</i>)

6-female_large_chest_is_visible=crush,(<i>Hmm... it's not like I have anyone else's to compare to except Yugiri... but I'm starting to understand why people like motorboating...</i>)
6-female_large_chest_is_visible=happy,If I were in my makeup, or... alive, then we'd be pretty close in size!
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=crush,Um... Haru, you're really going to have teach a pure and decent idol some of your skills... it's only fair, you're getting a private concert....
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddesses don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? (<i>So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i></i>)
6-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_there=why,I-I'm not staring like I'm <i>attracted</i>. You're just... w-with no bra, do you have something magic to stop your back from hurting?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,Aww, don't worry, ~name~! I'm sure you look fine! Trust me! I had a lot of... um... adaptation issues, too!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smile,It's okay, ~name~! If I can be more or less happy with my body, think of how good yours must look to everyone here! I-if that's going to make you happy!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:akko=huh,I know we're about to see her naked but... Akko, are these... s-supposed to make me feel so... lewd?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=zettai,Just keep it together, Catria! I'm sure <i>you</i> will look just as sweet at the rest of your body!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=doubt,...You're less like Junko than I expected-- I-I mean, Number Four!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hanako=crush,N-no, Hanako, I bet people are actually really excited. I bet it'll be just  like the rest of you.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=crush,(<i>She's so confident with her body! What I wouldn't give to </i>do<i> w-what</i>?)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:butt=doubt,Ini... I'm so sorry. But... this is kind of what happens when you play games like this. I'll still support you, though... as an idol...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=hum,That seems like... common sense, right?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=hum,(<i>Pretty naughty, getting to see the illusive Kizuna Ai, naked...</i>)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=why,Huh? D-do girls do that? Give away their underwear? (<i>I... if someone gave me their boxers as sleepwear. If we were dating... that's one thing, but what would you do with another girl's panties?</i>)
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=smile,Um... if it makes you feel better, you're really... womanly!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=crush,P-promise you won't strike us blind? I know some spirits are known for that...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ah! Those were real knives!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=crush,I've got your back. I promise.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=why,Twilight! You can't just remove your panties first! That's-- that's terribly lewd! Everyone can see your pubic hair! And your--
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=rap,Are you trying to embarrass yourself?! Are you clueless or what!?
6-female_crotch_is_visible=smile,I don't suppose you're ready for a perfromance, ~name~?
6-female_crotch_is_visible=why,Hm... very cute! I bet you feel amazing-- f-for whoever's into that kind of thing.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=why,B-b-but you have no hair! Do-- is this really in style now? Isn't it...?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=crush,W-what? You're... you're clean shaven? I've... never actually seen someone do that in person! And here I thought you'd be interviewing me!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=happy,<i>Perfect</i> combination of natural and prepped! You look amazing, ~name~! Ready for the stage! (<i>Or other things, too.</i>)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=smile,I don't do that <i>now</i>, ~name~, but I always liked to keep myself neat and tidy.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:akko=zettai,Even though you're out of clothes, you're at max cute, and I'm at max hype, Akko!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria=crush,It's okay to be a little turned on. I think we're all a little turned on. (<i>I'm definitely a little turned on.</i>)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=smile,You know, I bet Number Four... Junko... would go about this the same way you do, Futaba. Terribly cute.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hanako=hum,For some reason, I suppose I was expecting more maintainance...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru=why,H-Haru-san, I think your dirty talk is really working. It's just working on the wrong person...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Aww, don't be ashamed! Red hair's super pretty and it looks great on you! I don't think anyone who you wanted to see you naked'd care much.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>But I suppose she could say the same about me!</i>) A-Ai-chan! Where's your hair!? It's so detailed b-but...

-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!

-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,I guess pretty girls never really go out of style... or nice boobs...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=crush,A-as a fan, ~name~, do you think you'd mind showing off some of our apparel? Or maybe... one of our outfits? It'd fit perfectly!

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddesses don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? (<i>So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i></i>)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_there=why,I-I'm not staring like I'm <i>attracted</i>. You're just... w-with no bra, do you have something magic to stop your back from hurting?

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=zettai,Just keep it together, Catria! I'm sure <i>you</i> will look just as sweet at the rest of your body!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=doubt,...You're less like Junko than I expected-- I-I mean, Number Four!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hanako=crush,N-no, Hanako, I bet people are actually really excited. I bet it'll be just  like the rest of you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=crush,(<i>She's so confident with her body! What I wouldn't give to </i>do<i> w-what</i>?)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:butt=doubt,Ini... I'm so sorry. But... this is kind of what happens when you play games like this. I'll still support you, though... as an idol...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=hum,That seems like... common sense, right?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=hum,(<i>Pretty naughty, getting to see the illusive Kizuna Ai, naked...</i>)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=why,Huh? D-do girls do that? Give away their underwear? (<i>I... if someone gave me their boxers as sleepwear. If we were dating... that's one thing, but what would you do with another girl's panties?</i>)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=smile,Um... if it makes you feel better, you're really... womanly!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=crush,P-promise you won't strike us blind? I know some spirits are known for that...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=ohno,Ah! Those were real knives!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=crush,I've got your back. I promise.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=why,Twilight! You can't just remove your panties first! That's-- that's terribly lewd! Everyone can see your pubic hair! And your--
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=rap,Are you trying to embarrass yourself?! Are you clueless or what!?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=happy,(<i>Maybe it's just because I'm close but... I wouldn't mind...</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=crush,W-wow. Is this... one of those things that you just... really start to feel things, in the moment?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=calm,F-from a certain point of view, I can see the appeal in being clean shaven... w-who wants to have a partner complain about getting hair in their mouth, r-right?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=smile,W-well, I think that "bare" look would ruin my image. It's better on sexy, forward types like ~name~. (<i>I bet if Ai knew about this, she'd <i>totally</i> shave.</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=smile,If I knew I was going to be playing this tonight, I'd probably have cleaned up more than usual too.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=smile,That's like the perfect length! You still look really feminine, but like a woman... you know?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:akko=zettai,Even though you're out of clothes, you're at max cute, and I'm at max hype, Akko!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria=crush,It's okay to be a little turned on. I think we're all a little turned on. (<i>I'm definitely a little turned on.</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=smile,You know, I bet Number Four... Junko... would go about this the same way you do, Futaba. Terribly cute.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hanako=hum,For some reason, I suppose I was expecting more maintainance...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru=why,H-Haru-san, I think your dirty talk is really working. It's just working on the wrong person...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini=smile,Aww, don't be ashamed! Red hair's super pretty and it looks great on you! I don't think anyone who you wanted to see you naked'd care much.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,(<i>But I suppose she could say the same about me!</i>) A-Ai-chan! Where's your hair!? It's so detailed b-but...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=sing,I'll always have a soft spot for a girls with a courage to show their... soft spots! Mahiru's an auteur at heart, it seems!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=zettai,It's the Legendary Crown Prince Miko!

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=why,O-oh! Well... um. Your looks... like mine, but with brown hair, and mine's got pink hair, and... (<i>I've heard of going out on a limb for a fan, but...</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=huh,I'm... really seeing this, aren't I? W-well, I guess I should do <i>something</i> to make it up to you, Palutena... maybe a song...?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=rap,Obviously, you wouldn't wear panties under a leotard. That'd just be silly! It'd ride up and look really stupid. Not to mention, uncomfortable!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=why,T-they're not especially dangerous, but they are especially scary... are you all okay?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=why,Meia! Revy! Stop it! Franchouchou isn't about violence!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=huh,O-oh. Is shaving that common, now?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=huh,W-Wow! You're really toned. I guess that witch fighting is a great workout.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=huh,I-I guess if it makes you happy... I... I just... what? (<i>What do I... do I need to watch over her?</i>)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3=doubt,Sorry Twilight... I guess where you're from, this is normal... I'll... stop badgering you over it. (<i>Even Tae listens! She's so weird! Very cute and nice! But so weird!!</i>)

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

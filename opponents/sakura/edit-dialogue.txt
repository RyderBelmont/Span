#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,Um... it would... complicate... our routines... y-yeah....
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...

0-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And it just goes to show that undead can be <i>very</i> nice and <i>really</i> quite normal.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...

0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons...

0-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, at least you're honest! (<i>I think I'm safe for now.</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Um... sorry, no reason. I'm sure you're more used to something like a muse, right...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Franchouchou is kind of... unique... because... um, we're mostly regional idols... so, if we widened our base... we'd just be happy to meet new fans, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?

1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,Um... it would... complicate... our routines... y-yeah....
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You worked so hard on this! I can really see your dedication to your craft... your... uh, witchcraft!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And it just goes to show that undead can be <i>very</i> nice and <i>really</i> quite normal.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt a necromancer, or his nice zombies, right? A-asking for a friend...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That looks so complicated! I bet if it were easy, everyone would do it, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, at least you're honest! (<i>I think I'm safe for now.</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Um... sorry, no reason. I'm sure you're more used to something like a muse, right...?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Franchouchou is kind of... unique... because... um, we're mostly regional idols... so, if we widened our base... we'd just be happy to meet new fans, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?

2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,Um... it would... complicate... our routines... y-yeah....
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You worked so hard on this! I can really see your dedication to your craft... your... uh, witchcraft!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=why,C-could you not, Akko?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And it just goes to show that undead can be <i>very</i> nice and <i>really</i> quite normal.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt a necromancer, or his nice zombies, right? A-asking for a friend...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That looks so complicated! I bet if it were easy, everyone would do it, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Well, at least you're honest! (<i>I think I'm safe for now.</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Um... sorry, no reason. I'm sure you're more used to something like a muse, right...?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Franchouchou is kind of... unique... because... um, we're mostly regional idols... so, if we widened our base... we'd just be happy to meet new fans, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?

3-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=why,O-oh. I'm surprised you're sticking to small stuff, ~name~! I'd have expected a bit of a bigger play!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=sing,Nice to see another idol here, Pit! And it looks like you brought your fanclub!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,It's great to know Franchouchou has such great fans! You're so skilled at cards, so I can only imagine what other stuff you're good at! (<i>Though... if you were good with your hands, that'd be best.</i>)
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,You're playing super well, huh, ~name~? To have something like that as a backup singer?
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,(<i>I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm here, in public, without my makeup, and some guy's just taking off his ~clothing~.</i>)  S-sorry! I was just caught up on your ~clothing~, ~name~!
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,Well, at least you can't rely on that again, ~name~. If you've got it, better use it!
3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,Hm... that's... a little small, does it really count-- n-nevermind. G-good play, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=hum,When I'm on stage, I'm so happy! Like my heart is buzzing! I think ~name~ feels the same! She doesn't want to sit down and give up! No way!
3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=sing,Her ~clothing~ is small, but every little piece counts! A win, a song, a grand-slam performance all come from these small things!
3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=zettai,O-oh! Looks like some of us are playing really well! Good for you, ~name~! Just keep getting back up and coming on for more!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...

3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?

3-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! (<i>I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,I'm going to keep my ribbons on no matter what, ~name~! So, I think it's amazing of you to take off ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?

4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
4-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,It's great to know Franchouchou has such great fans! You're so skilled at cards, so I can only imagine what other stuff you're good at! (<i>Though... if you were good with your hands, that'd be best.</i>)
4-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,You're playing super well, huh, ~name~? To have something like that as a backup singer?
4-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,(<i>I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm here, in public, without my makeup, and some guy's just taking off his ~clothing~.</i>)  S-sorry! I was just caught up on your ~clothing~, ~name~!
4-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,Well, at least you can't rely on that again, ~name~. If you've got it, better use it!
4-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,Hm... that's... a little small, does it really count-- n-nevermind. G-good play, ~name~.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
4-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=hum,When I'm on stage, I'm so happy! Like my heart is buzzing! I think ~name~ feels the same! She doesn't want to sit down and give up! No way!
4-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=sing,Her ~clothing~ is small, but every little piece counts! A win, a song, a grand-slam performance all come from these small things!
4-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=zettai,O-oh! Looks like some of us are playing really well! Good for you, ~name~! Just keep getting back up and coming on for more!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=why,C-could you not, Akko?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
4-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
4-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! (<i>I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,I'm going to keep my ribbons on no matter what, ~name~! So, I think it's amazing of you to take off ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?


#lost dress
5-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=hum,Nice ~clothing~, ~name~! (<i>It's a shame he's a fan, y'know? ~clothing.ifPlural(They're|It's)~ really kind of cute!</i>)
5-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=smile,My heart is pounding, so… if you wanted to be a bit reckless, I wouldn’t mind.
5-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=why,O-oh. I'm surprised you're sticking to small stuff, ~name~! I'd have expected a bit of a bigger play!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=sing,Nice to see another idol here, Pit! And it looks like you brought your fanclub!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,It's great to know Franchouchou has such great fans! You're so skilled at cards, so I can only imagine what other stuff you're good at! (<i>Though... if you were good with your hands, that'd be best.</i>)
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,You're playing super well, huh, ~name~? To have something like that as a backup singer?
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,(<i>I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm here, in public, without my makeup, and some guy's just taking off his ~clothing~.</i>)  S-sorry! I was just caught up on your ~clothing~, ~name~!
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,Well, at least you can't rely on that again, ~name~. If you've got it, better use it!
5-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,Hm... that's... a little small, does it really count-- n-nevermind. G-good play, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
5-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=hum,When I'm on stage, I'm so happy! Like my heart is buzzing! I think ~name~ feels the same! She doesn't want to sit down and give up! No way!
5-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=sing,Her ~clothing~ is small, but every little piece counts! A win, a song, a grand-slam performance all come from these small things!
5-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=zettai,O-oh! Looks like some of us are playing really well! Good for you, ~name~! Just keep getting back up and coming on for more!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=why,C-could you not, Akko?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
5-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
5-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
5-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! (<i>I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,I'm going to keep my ribbons on no matter what, ~name~! So, I think it's amazing of you to take off ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?


#lost bra
6-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=doubt,Hm. Your ~clothing~? Well... I guess that's how it goes sometimes, but... (<i>Is he that afraid of getting naked in front of me...?</i>)
6-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh man. I'm getting my butt kicked...</i>) N-nice ~clothing~, ~name~. Um...
6-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=huh,Wait a second, you still had your ~clothing~? You didn't bring that back when we weren't looking, right?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=sing,Nice to see another idol here, Pit! And it looks like you brought your fanclub!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
6-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
6-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
6-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
6-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=rap,~Clothing~, even when an idol is naked? Try it again, guy, and this rapping I won't really be faking.
6-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=doubt,~Clothing~...? Woo... C'mon, ~name~! Where's your spirit?! Your undying passion!? You can do better than that, can't you?
6-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=rap,~Name~, Franchouchou's Number One is almost naked. If you only take off your ~clothing~, how can I possibly think you're having fun, and not... shoot! Lost my beat.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
6-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
6-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
6-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
6-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=hum,~Name~~, if you don't take off something bigger, I'm going to have to bite my way through the rest of your clothes!
6-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=smile,~Name~, if you take off something bigger, I promise to sign you some merch!
6-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=rap,Your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ so small, it's like you wanna fall, and that you don't wanna take off anything at all!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=why,C-could you not, Akko?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
6-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!

6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)

6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=why,Just a joke! Just a Sakura joke!
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,(<i>Why would I say something like that? I sure as heck don’t know!</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=doubt,Sorry, ~name~, I'm happy to be playing with you, but your ~clothing~'s a real challenge to get enthusiastic over.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?

6-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?

-3-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=huh,Wait a second, you still had your ~clothing~? You didn't bring that back when we weren't looking, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=sing,Nice to see another idol here, Pit! And it looks like you brought your fanclub!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
-3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=rap,~Clothing~, even when an idol is naked? Try it again, guy, and this rapping I won't really be faking.
-3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=doubt,~Clothing~...? Woo... C'mon, ~name~! Where's your spirit?! Your undying passion!? You can do better than that, can't you?
-3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=rap,~Name~, Franchouchou's Number One is naked and undone. If you only take off your ~clothing~, how can I possibly think you're having fun, and not... shoot! Lost my beat.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=hum,~Name~~, if you don't take off something bigger, I'm going to have to bite my way through the rest of your clothes!
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=smile,~Name~, if you take off something bigger, I promise to sign you some merch!
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=rap,Your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ so small, it's like you wanna fall, and that you don't wanna take off anything at all!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=why,Just a joke! Just a Sakura joke!
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=huh,(<i>Why would I say something like that? I sure as heck don’t know!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=doubt,Sorry, ~name~, I'm happy to be playing with you, but your ~clothing~'s a real challenge to get enthusiastic over.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,id:19,direction:down=hi5,For a fan? A high five? Easy! C'mere, Estelle!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?

-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
-2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=zettai,As long as you don't stop there, ~name~! I'm not done yet, so I hope you aren't either!
-2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=rap,Oh that was <i>very</i> impressive... <i>suuuuper</i> good, ~name~!
-2-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,~Name~, if you're enjoying the show, I wouldn't mind seeing a little more skin. W-who doesn't like a love bite?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
-2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=crush,S-say, ~name~, I'm really proud of you for going on even though I've fallen a bit behind, but... you're really not getting a rise out of me here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,Um... ~name~, that's great and all but...
-2-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=doubt,Hm... (<i>It's not doing anything for me, but what ~clothing.ifPlural(cute|a cute)~ ~clothing~!</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=why,C-could you not, Akko?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=hum,T-to be fair, I <i>have</i> to be distracting to keep some attention over here! Do you need me to... tone down my moaning a bit?
-2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=smile,I bet if I were in your spot, I'd do the same thing. Well, I'd be doing my best to support my idol, so I guess we're just supporting each other in our own way, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,I'm just proud you're doing your best, ~name~! (<i>I kind of wonder what other areas she'd be best at...</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I'd give you a high five, Estelle but um... my hands are... somewhat messy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?


#finished
-1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,I'm not that into your ~clothing~, ~name~, but... you're definitely helping me build an appetite. For uh. Physical stuff...
-1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=doubt,That's... well. I'm proud you're doing well, ~name~, but... (<i>It's not exactly stimulating...</i>)
-1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=smile,Wow! Great ~clothing~! Um... really unconventional choice! I guess I'm here too, though...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=sing,Nice to see another idol here, Pit! And it looks like you brought your fanclub!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Oh, so you play the "smart boy" character, right?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,An angel, a... <i>me</i>, and a robot... what kind of game do we have going on here...?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,(<i>Unless... unless he's like me... and he's a robot with no eyes... he didn't have nipples, but he did have a cock...</i>)
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=huh,D-does that happen a lot to the two of you? D-do unconventional idols get naked during their near-death experiences?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou's not manly, but we embody undying feminine power! You'll never kick <i>us</i> to the curb, Kamina!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Oh, the angel look is really in for costumed boy groups.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:9s,direction:down=hum,Oh, I just figured you and 9S were from a boy group! You're dressed in contrast, after all.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Well, I'm sure you have a lovely singing voice, but you're dressed in loose stuff, with lots of accessories. Most boys don't do that.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Oh! The Franchouchou workout's pretty intense, but... working out for us is kinda complicated...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your belt's nice, but... it's a very cool shirt, I just wanted to know If you wanted some Franchouchou merch...
-1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,Um, don’t suppose you’d be willing to give that to me? Idols love to collect stuff from their fans. It's not a competition or anything but... (<i>I bet Saki would get a laugh out of this, at least.</i>)
-1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=ohno,That said, I can't believe you've still got things like that!
-1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=happy,C'mon, ~name~! I don't bite! Seriously. I'm not that kind of zombie. (<i>But... I could... maybe... use my mouth for other things...</i>)
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=smile,Oh, I see. I must have been mistaken. (<i>Hm... so he's one of those lowkey idol boys. Makes sense!</i>)
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,count-palutena:0,direction:down=doubt,...Then there's the way you talk about 'Palutena'. If that's not a case of an overbearing manager, I don't know what is.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Well, you'd <i>obviously</i> know that boy groups tend to be bigger than idol teams. Are there a 1S-8S too, or what?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,T-this is really an idol thing, and not a <i>something else</i> thing, r-right? E-everyone?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,You should go without your blindfold, 9S! It's... maybe less sexy, but your eyes are gorgeous!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,9S, your eyes are so gorgeous for a boy... b-but what about the near-death near-nude stuff? I-is that common?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8,direction:down=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I see. Well, you certainly dress and act the part. I thought this was just like an idol get-together! With... other stuff.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,direction:down=why,Palutena, I think you do a way better job managing Pit than my manager does for our group.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,...On account of the zombie thing. I'm not really sure we get stronger, but it's worth a shot!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Hope that's not a bad thing to say...
-1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=smile,Wow, way to keep playing well right until the end! But um... don't you think this is getting a little silly?
-1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=doubt,Even if I'm a zombie, I <i>can</i> get cold, ~name~.
-1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=calm,My fans are really the best! Um... I <i>hope</i> ~name~'s a fan by now, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,direction:down=smile,N-Natsuki, it's really quite rude to assume that just because two girls are close...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Talk about calling the kettle black, Natsuki...</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=sing,My dear friend's named Saki! But you're the brave one for making it out tonight.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Wow! You've come a long way for a meet and greet, Aella!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I see! My idol stuff is usually hand-made too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=why,(<i>Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=why,C-could you not, Akko?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,A-and nice... sword... are you... here for a cosplay convention?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I admire your commitment to training! Even at a game like this...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,It's weird, but whenever you see videos of people like you fighting, there's always music playing!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:belt,direction:down=huh,(<i>What does she mean by that?</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:laid back,direction:down=hum,That's... actually pretty good advice!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:2,targetSaying:take advantage,direction:down=doubt,This game already feels like it's taking advantage of me... no thank you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Well, we've already seen the sexy stuff, so...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-well, it's... your shoes but-- we can all see your... um! Emi! Hello!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:0,direction:down=crush,Big fan of the long gloves, myself. Don't you just feel like a princess with those?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I usually get new costumes fairly often... so you must really love those boots, Estelle!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,Yeah! Number Four is actually super shy and conservative like you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=why,--O-or you reminded me... of her... before... you left...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,O-oh! It's not makeup? I'm really jealous! (<i>Good save, I think!</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You just have to embrace them, and keep climbing on up.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,Well, even <i>as</i> an idol, I'm pretty into other idol groups. And you remind me a lot of myself.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,So... what do you do professionally, Ini?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Right, right, silly me. I won't draw attention to you anymore.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0,direction:down=sing,It's nice to have another performer here with me! I bet you have so many fun stories!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,S-so, Joey, what can you tell me about stage makeup? It's... not super obvious I'm wearing any... right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Just as an idol, you learn how to help people in the best ways. Music... kind words...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=hum,I'm not as into idol fashion as I used to be, but I always found magical girl stuff really cute!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Besides being a super hero, that is. What does this hero do in her downtime?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,So... you're a real life vampire?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,I hope everyone sees whether you're a human, a zombie, or a vampire, you can be a nice person at the end of the day. Or beginning of one, depending on which scares you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Hey there, Monika! What school do you go to?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I blinked and it was... gone...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,T-that's a little crass, don't you think?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,I guess she <i>is</i> a product of her time. She kind of reminds me of Number Five, honestly!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=why,(<i>Poor girl...</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,If you won't accept being called cute, how about "striking?" You really know how to make the most of what you've got, Natsuki!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'll admit, I've never... actually heard someone play a harp face to face, though. You make it sound beautiful!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:song_hero,targetNotSaidMarker:song_herotoo,targetSayingMarker:song_herotoo,direction:down=happy,I'm sure you'll get it in time, Nayru!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,But you just look so refined and gorgeous! Do you like to dance, too?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Playing with someone nice like you definitely makes this much easier, but... I didn't know it was <i>this</i> kind of game! I was told it was just a meet and greet!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>It's actually really hard to find an Idol-like way to ask if this is a sex thing.</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,R-really?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,It seems a lot like what you do... with less stripping.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-wait, where'd your hat go?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,S-sorry, maybe I was mistaken.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You're <i>the</i> Radical Revy-chan, aren't you, Revy!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're even scarier in person! But as an idol, I actually really enjoyed studying your costumes!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,S-sorry, sorry! It won't happen again!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I bet you're a big fan of Franchouchou #6! A lot of the big, tough folks really like her.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I really, really admire that kind of attitude.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Dumb question, but what <i>is</i> it with your outfit? Is it a tribal uniform, or cosplay, or...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,Like... Franchouchou Number Two. I'm Number One... and uh...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=why,It's rather unkind to make your friend take off your clothes...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... seriously, I hope you weren't expecting a fist fight...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,And even if you're not, it's just the right thing for me to do.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,Y-you wouldn't hurt an innocent zombie like me, would you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,Did you say "The Federation?" I haven't heard of them. What kind of music do you make?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh? Would you like some help with that? I always have that problem with my jacket buttons... like you saw...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=doubt,(<i>For a girl that's worried about appearances, you sure picked the wrong game for it.</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,I see... that's... interesting...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=huh,W-what? Those are some great special effects!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well, this is one way of undressing...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=why,W-what kind of ghost are you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=crush,Well... that wasn't your last item... right? So at least you can keep on going!
-1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=hum,(<i>It's just nice that people are treating me like I'm normal!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=zettai,See it through to the very end, and beyond, if you have to, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:1,count-human_female:1,direction:down=rap,Ryuko, you don't have to be a jerk! And Natsuki, you too! ~Player~, if this <i>is</i> a date, why am I here?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:natsuki,count-ddlc:2-3,direction:down=smile,Um... I think there's been a misunderstanding and I am <i>certainly</i> not meant to be here, so if it's okay with everyone, I'll just... no? W-well...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,count-musician:2,direction:down=sing,I sure hope you stick around, Nayru! I'd hate to be the only singer here.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I can't say I'm familiar, but I hope you'll leave a fan of Franchouchou, if nothing else!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It sure is nice having stuff custom-made. Really lets you be comfy, but show off the best parts of your figure, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon,direction:down=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie,direction:down=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Well... A-anyway, are you a fan of idol music? You know, lots of upbeat, cheery, inspiry stuff?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's impressive in her own right, but how cool would it be if she liked our music?!</i>) Chun-li, have you heard of Franchouchou?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,S-sorry if that's really weird...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh gosh, I'm glad my manager isn't like her, at least!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:coco,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>I think Coco'd have more fun with Yugiri or Saki... girls with strong personalities. I should probably just... let this one go.</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:emi,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Oh... I'm sorry about your legs, Emi, but you seem really upbeat! That's just awesome! (<i>Talk about making the best of a bad situation...</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I'd give you a high five, Estelle but um... my hands are... somewhat messy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Are you <i>sure</i> you aren't an idol? You'd be perfect at it if you could sing or dance! So tenacious!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,You can do anything you set your mind to! Junko--Number Four, that is, still gets on stage and has the best voice of any of us. Do you like singing?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=calm,It's okay, Florina! Just um... let's hope this game ends soon, for all our sakes, okay?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You're just naturally pretty! A lot of work goes into looking like an idol, but you're a natural.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,...Some of us more literally than others.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,I guess it's wrong to judge a book by her appearance. But you're just the type of girl I'd love to inspire.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Oh my gosh, I get it, this is a <i>role</i> you're playing! Who has a real name like Ini Miney. I admire your dedication to the craft!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Franchouchou doesn't really have a ditz... wait, am I the ditz in my group?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I guess you're really just playing for fun, aren't you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-well, I meant to ask when I <i>was</i>. This is more of an... all-natural look. For a zombie. Of course.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I think you must be a really tough person. And you're certainly... very unique! (<i> If maybe a little bit of a mess at times...</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Using something cute like a yo-yo as your weapon is certainly suitable for a defender of justice!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,If you ever want to check out Franchouchou, we'd love to have you in the audience, that's for dang sure!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,You're so upbeat! I almost said something senseless. (<i>I mean, it's not like I eat brains, so it makes sense that she's not like the myths.</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I guess Mavis isn't <i>really</i> a princess, even if she is super pretty.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:remilia,direction:down=doubt,...Even if <i>some tiny</i> vampires act like <i>giant</i> jerks.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,D-deleted? Our clothes surely aren't being destroyed, are they?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>I might be a zombie but this girl is seriously creepy!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,N-no, that's fine, you can stop there. (<i>So crude! What kind of man is Ping?</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Plus, I'm pretty sure they both have spent a lot of time in brothels, but I'm not judging...</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,<i>Sigh.</i> Yeah, I guess that was dumb of me to assume...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,I hope you stick around, Nayru! I have so many questions I want to talk about with you!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,N-not to judge, but did you just come here for... er... a good time?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Well, you're certainly cleaning up here, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You have the right disposition for it, but Franchouchou tends to be... well, more conservative.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Sakuya, how'd you do that? That was a really cool trick!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,(<i>It definitely</i> couldn't<i> be</i> her, <i>could it?</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm an idol doesn't mean I don't know about the internet...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Your outfits were a little kinky for Franchouchou... but just perfect for the "scary but sweet" angle we like to use sometimes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>I just... wanted an autograph. It's hard to</i> get<i> those as an idol...</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Or maybe #2... but she's more for troublemakers. #6 is just popular with big, burly people like you, even though she's so small and cute!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Franchouchou could use more fans like you, that's for dang sure! Love your passion, Rinkah!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Wow, you really take this seriously, don't you? I just like... all the idol outfits I get to dress up in.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Okay, so you aren't into idol music, no reason to be hostile...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:mako,direction:down=smile,W-well, I guess if you're <i>special</i> friends... what's the harm in that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Oh no, Mako! (<i>Idols are supposed to lift people up, not knock them out!</i> Not literally!)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,targetSaying:shrimpy,alsoPlaying:natsuki,notSaidMarker:shrimpy,marker:shrimpy,direction:down=huh,Could you... not call her Shrimpy, Ryuko?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,saidMarker:shrimpy,marker:mfg,direction:down=huh,What did I just say about calling her that, Ryuko? Do you think this is a motherfucking game?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>She's so glum! I need to cheer her up!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I was... kind of like you, I think. I think idol music really brought me out of my shell and my funk, you know? So I recommend it to everyone.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:9,direction:down=smile,E-either way, <i>cute</i> outfit and please focus on your witch.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I just had guessed you were another idol or musician. Your hair and outfit are so immaculate, after all!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,It's kind of a relief to get changed, right? Um, anyway. Franchouchou really touches about every genre. That way we can touch the most hearts, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,You remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on who...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,Hm. (<i>Who is it she reminds me of...?</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=ohno,Y-you're not really hurt, are you, Shimakaze?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're <i>way</i> too cute, Shimakaze! And you're so comfortable with pyrotechnics! Have you considered being an Idol?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Well... you're sort of scary. (<i>Is this some sort of post-death trauma experience?</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:indoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right? I mean, if this were outside... the floor's not too gross, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,test:~background.location~:outdoors,direction:down=smile,Either way, it's nice to feel the earth under your feet sometimes, right?




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,It's not easy being an Idol, and I know I put a lot of work in. But, ~name~ probably spent a lot of time getting his  ~clothing~ ready for the game, too, huh?
male_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,I really like stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~! But, I'll admit I just feel so dang pretty in my idol gear.
male_removing_minor,direction:down=hum,Your ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ make|~clothing~ makes)~ me kind of jealous! In Franchouchou, most of our outfits are pretty coordinated.
male_removed_minor,direction:down=happy,I know Franchouchou's an idol group, but we lean a little bit into heavy metal too! Well, we're great at headbanging, ~name~.
male_removed_minor,direction:down=calm,Hm? Your ~clothing~? For some reason, I feel like that's something Number Two would wear in her spare time... she's a bit of a rougher, less refined Idol!
male_removed_minor,direction:down=smile,You know, ~name~, I can't really date, being an Idol and all, but I bet your girlfriend would love to wear your ~clothing~!
female_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,Your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ so neat, ~name~! Maybe I should pick something like ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ up for myself? It's not like I've got a super expansive set out of outfits, after all.
female_removing_minor,direction:down=happy,I always really appreciate the kinds of outfits people wear to Franchouchou concerts! ~Name~'s ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ pretty amazing!
female_removing_minor,direction:down=hum,Hm. Idols are really supposed to keep close to a pattern or uniform, so it's easy to recognize us. But, even so, I'd love to work something like ~name~'s ~clothing~ into my wardrobe!
female_removed_minor,direction:down=calm,(<i>It <i>would</i> be nice to have some more changes of clothes. Cute ~clothing~, at least.</i>)
female_removed_minor,direction:down=zettai,Saga's a small province, but I hope we can make up for it in spirit! Sort of like how ~name~'s ~clothing~~clothing.ifPlural('re|'s)~ probably really important to her!
female_removed_minor,direction:down=huh,I will say, it's not typical that our fans will undress at our concerts...

0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I bet Natsuki and Akko-chan have some suggestions for things they'd like to dress you in.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I just meant the rebellious types usually prefer Number Two. In Franchouchou... my idol group.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Franchouchou tends to like more bright, upbeat stuff, but I think the gothic lolita look would be <i>killer</i> on some of our girls.

0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=hum,Uh huh.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I'd bet you'd look good in just about everything.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls,direction:down=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Oh... did you hurt yourself, Ryuji...?
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Sorry for rambling. You're just getting me in a technical mood, 9S!

0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,(<i>We're the relatable ones in our idol groups, Pit, you have to be flexible for the fans.</i>)
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Aww, there's nothing wrong with loving idol music, Ryuji! But... I can keep a secret if you're embarrassed.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince,direction:down=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
0-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...
0-female_removing_minor,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,...You're certainly... confident...
0-female_removing_minor,target:emi,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:wave,direction:down=smile,We're a bit of an up-and-coming group, but I think you'd love the tracks with Number Two or Number Six as the leads.
0-female_removing_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Though, to be honest, with the size of your outift... could've convinced me!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Maybe if you hum or sang, this'd be easier for you? I'd be happy to join you as backing vocals!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I'm a fan of long gloves like those. They just look <i>so</i> pretty!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Go for it! I'm admittedly a little jealous... a soldier, a singer... you can really--
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=sing,Would it help you if we sang something, Florina?
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=zettai,You've got a good friend, Florina!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,direction:down=crush,You've got a good <i>friend</i>, Florina!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=why,Florina-- your clothes! You're--
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... Earth to Futaba...?
0-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
0-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
0-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I prefer to be a little more dressed... but it was a great look for you!
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
0-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
0-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I was a pretty effective student... but... (<i>I don't think I'd have been bold enough to come to a game like this.</i>)

0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,S-sorry, Natsuki! I wasn't staring, just... (<i>Think think think, and don't stereotype her, Sakura!</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>She'd be quite charming if she weren't so abrasive...</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
0-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
0-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
0-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
0-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
0-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
0-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
0-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
0-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
0-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,A-all you'd... r-really... sing and dance. Goodness, you look cute like this...
0-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,O-oh! What a mess! Come over here, let me fix that for you...
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Does-- does that happen to you all the time, Florina?
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
0-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,U-uhm. Just... how much makeup I really need to look like this, I suppose.
0-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I think every body type can be impressive, but most Japanese stores cater to thinner girls, you know, Haru? You have to tell me where you shop!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,I... don't normally admit this. But I have some rather unpleasant re-birth marks, Kyoko. Um. Birthmarks, I mean!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you happened to love singing and dancing, you'd really give me a run for my money...
0-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
0-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
0-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,I... wasn't coming here your idea...? Why'd you want to leave halfway?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...

1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Franchouchou tends to like more bright, upbeat stuff, but I think the gothic lolita look would be <i>killer</i> on some of our girls.

1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.

1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.

1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
1-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...

1-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
1-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
1-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)

1-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I prefer to be a little more dressed... but it was a great look for you!
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!

1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)

1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...

1-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
1-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
1-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
1-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,A-all you'd... r-really... sing and dance. Goodness, you look cute like this...
1-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,O-oh! What a mess! Come over here, let me fix that for you...
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Does-- does that happen to you all the time, Florina?
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,U-uhm. Just... how much makeup I really need to look like this, I suppose.
1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I think every body type can be impressive, but most Japanese stores cater to thinner girls, you know, Haru? You have to tell me where you shop!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
1-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,I... don't normally admit this. But I have some rather unpleasant re-birth marks, Kyoko. Um. Birthmarks, I mean!
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you happened to love singing and dancing, you'd really give me a run for my money...
1-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!

1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,I... wasn't coming here your idea...? Why'd you want to leave halfway?
1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...
1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.

2-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
2-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
2-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
2-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,A-all you'd... r-really... sing and dance. Goodness, you look cute like this...
2-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,O-oh! What a mess! Come over here, let me fix that for you...
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Does-- does that happen to you all the time, Florina?
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,U-uhm. Just... how much makeup I really need to look like this, I suppose.
2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I think every body type can be impressive, but most Japanese stores cater to thinner girls, you know, Haru? You have to tell me where you shop!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,I... don't normally admit this. But I have some rather unpleasant re-birth marks, Kyoko. Um. Birthmarks, I mean!
2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you happened to love singing and dancing, you'd really give me a run for my money...
2-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,I... wasn't coming here your idea...? Why'd you want to leave halfway?
2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down to the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!
2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Uh, sure sure, Remilia. Um, Sakuya, how'd you do that? That's a super neat trick!
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Oh, and by the way, your glasses are super cute, Saki! They really bring out your eyes!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't be shy, Sayaka! We're here to help people, remember...? Though getting to wear cute outfits is a big plus in my book.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Okay, girls with pink hair and ribbons have <i>got</i> to have lots in common, right, Sayori?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,T-that makes this a little weirder than I wanted...
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,I'd expect nothing less from my "sis," anyway. (<i>That's probably a little too personal, but she</i> does<i> look like me.</i>)
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,<i>Now</i> I get it! You remind me of Yugiri! But she goes by Franchouchou #5!
2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,<i>You are just too cute, Shimakaze! I wanna take you home and protect you!</i>


#lost makeup
3-male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,Fashion's always been kind of a weak spot for me. I wouldn't have expected ~name~'s stuff to look so cool! Back when I died, you'd have been even more of a trendsetter.
3-male_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,So... I was in the best shape of my life right before <i>you know</i>, so ~name~'s ~clothing~ would actually look real cute on me!
3-male_removing_minor,direction:down=why,Y-you aren't just picking your ~clothing~ because you're afraid of me, or something, right, ~name~?
3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I bet Natsuki and Akko-chan have some suggestions for things they'd like to dress you in.
3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I just meant the rebellious types usually prefer Number Two. In Franchouchou... my idol group.
3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Franchouchou tends to like more bright, upbeat stuff, but I think the gothic lolita look would be <i>killer</i> on some of our girls.
3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=crush,(<i>At least the boys here are cute... and they'd probably understand me...</i>)
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,O-oh! A-as zombies, we're never supposed to unwind our bandages...
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,T-the bandages again!
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=hum,Uh huh.
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I'd bet you'd look good in just about everything.
3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls,direction:down=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!
3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Oh... did you hurt yourself, Ryuji...?
3-male_removed_minor,direction:down=doubt,Even though I get to be an idol, sometimes I get <i>super</i> jealous. When you're an Idol, there's all these rules you have to follow. An uh, when you're undead, I guess.
3-male_removed_minor,direction:down=happy,If the whole "secret zombie" thing wasn't... y'know, a secret, I'd still love to take a picture with you, ~name~!
3-male_removed_minor,direction:down=zettai,The way I look at it, you stop living only when you stop caring! And trust me when I say that I, and all of Franchouchou, care a lot! Even about stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~!
3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Sorry for rambling. You're just getting me in a technical mood, 9S!
3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=hum,(<i>And they get along so well... gosh, between Pit's can-do attitude and 9S being... adaptable...</i>)
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Sorry, just thinking of all the weird things that can happen...
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You are... almost absurdly good looking, Kamina.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
3-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,(<i>We're the relatable ones in our idol groups, Pit, you have to be flexible for the fans.</i>)
3-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Aww, there's nothing wrong with loving idol music, Ryuji! But... I can keep a secret if you're embarrassed.
3-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince,direction:down=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
3-female_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,Aww, don't worry, ~name~! Let me get you a Franchouchou shirt or jacket to replace your ~clothing~. Promise!
3-female_removing_minor,direction:down=doubt,It'll be okay, ~name~! Don't give up...! (<i>I want to be enthusiastic! I really do! I just... just her ~clothing~?!</i>)
3-female_removing_minor,direction:down=zettai,I know you can't put your ~clothing~ back on, ~name~, but it'll come back at the end of the game. Amazing how that works, right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
3-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...
3-female_removing_minor,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,...You're certainly... confident...
3-female_removing_minor,target:emi,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:wave,direction:down=smile,We're a bit of an up-and-coming group, but I think you'd love the tracks with Number Two or Number Six as the leads.
3-female_removing_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Though, to be honest, with the size of your outift... could've convinced me!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Maybe if you hum or sang, this'd be easier for you? I'd be happy to join you as backing vocals!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I'm a fan of long gloves like those. They just look <i>so</i> pretty!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Go for it! I'm admittedly a little jealous... a soldier, a singer... you can really--
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=sing,Would it help you if we sang something, Florina?
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=zettai,You've got a good friend, Florina!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,direction:down=crush,You've got a good <i>friend</i>, Florina!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=why,Florina-- your clothes! You're--
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... Earth to Futaba...?
3-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
3-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
3-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
3-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I prefer to be a little more dressed... but it was a great look for you!
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
3-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
3-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I was a pretty effective student... but... (<i>I don't think I'd have been bold enough to come to a game like this.</i>)
3-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,S-sorry, Natsuki! I wasn't staring, just... (<i>Think think think, and don't stereotype her, Sakura!</i>)
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>She'd be quite charming if she weren't so abrasive...</i>)

3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=happy,I know I'm a little... different looking! But I think that helps ~name~'s beauty stand out-- especially without her ~clothing~!

3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down to the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!

4-male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,Fashion's always been kind of a weak spot for me. I wouldn't have expected ~name~'s stuff to look so cool! Back when I died, you'd have been even more of a trendsetter.
4-male_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,So... I was in the best shape of my life right before <i>you know</i>, so ~name~'s ~clothing~ would actually look real cute on me!
4-male_removing_minor,direction:down=why,Y-you aren't just picking your ~clothing~ because you're afraid of me, or something, right, ~name~?
4-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I bet Natsuki and Akko-chan have some suggestions for things they'd like to dress you in.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I just meant the rebellious types usually prefer Number Two. In Franchouchou... my idol group.
4-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Franchouchou tends to like more bright, upbeat stuff, but I think the gothic lolita look would be <i>killer</i> on some of our girls.

4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,T-the bandages again!
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=hum,Uh huh.
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
4-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I'd bet you'd look good in just about everything.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls,direction:down=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Oh... did you hurt yourself, Ryuji...?
4-male_removed_minor,direction:down=doubt,Even though I get to be an idol, sometimes I get <i>super</i> jealous. When you're an Idol, there's all these rules you have to follow. An uh, when you're undead, I guess.
4-male_removed_minor,direction:down=happy,If the whole "secret zombie" thing wasn't... y'know, a secret, I'd still love to take a picture with you, ~name~!
4-male_removed_minor,direction:down=zettai,The way I look at it, you stop living only when you stop caring! And trust me when I say that I, and all of Franchouchou, care a lot! Even about stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~!
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Sorry for rambling. You're just getting me in a technical mood, 9S!

4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You are... almost absurdly good looking, Kamina.
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
4-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,(<i>We're the relatable ones in our idol groups, Pit, you have to be flexible for the fans.</i>)
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Aww, there's nothing wrong with loving idol music, Ryuji! But... I can keep a secret if you're embarrassed.
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince,direction:down=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
4-female_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,Aww, don't worry, ~name~! Let me get you a Franchouchou shirt or jacket to replace your ~clothing~. Promise!
4-female_removing_minor,direction:down=doubt,It'll be okay, ~name~! Don't give up...! (<i>I want to be enthusiastic! I really do! I just... just her ~clothing~?!</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,direction:down=zettai,I know you can't put your ~clothing~ back on, ~name~, but it'll come back at the end of the game. Amazing how that works, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
4-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
4-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
4-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...
4-female_removing_minor,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,...You're certainly... confident...
4-female_removing_minor,target:emi,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:wave,direction:down=smile,We're a bit of an up-and-coming group, but I think you'd love the tracks with Number Two or Number Six as the leads.
4-female_removing_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Though, to be honest, with the size of your outift... could've convinced me!
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Maybe if you hum or sang, this'd be easier for you? I'd be happy to join you as backing vocals!
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I'm a fan of long gloves like those. They just look <i>so</i> pretty!
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Go for it! I'm admittedly a little jealous... a soldier, a singer... you can really--
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=sing,Would it help you if we sang something, Florina?
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=zettai,You've got a good friend, Florina!

4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... Earth to Futaba...?
4-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
4-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
4-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
4-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
4-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I prefer to be a little more dressed... but it was a great look for you!
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
4-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
4-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I was a pretty effective student... but... (<i>I don't think I'd have been bold enough to come to a game like this.</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,S-sorry, Natsuki! I wasn't staring, just... (<i>Think think think, and don't stereotype her, Sakura!</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>She'd be quite charming if she weren't so abrasive...</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
4-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
4-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
4-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
4-female_removed_minor,direction:down=crush,Don't worry, ~name~! Seriously! I have the worst luck in the world, but you're still breathing! Don't give up!
4-female_removed_minor,direction:down=happy,I know I'm a little... different looking! But I think that helps ~name~'s beauty stand out-- especially without her ~clothing~!
4-female_removed_minor,direction:down=sing,It's the Legendary ~name~ and her Legendary ~Clothing~! See, ~name~? Everyone's got <i>some</i> sort of legend to them!
4-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
4-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
4-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
4-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
4-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
4-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
4-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
4-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,A-all you'd... r-really... sing and dance. Goodness, you look cute like this...
4-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,O-oh! What a mess! Come over here, let me fix that for you...
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Does-- does that happen to you all the time, Florina?
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
4-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
4-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
4-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
4-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
4-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
4-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?

5-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...
5-female_removing_minor,target:coco,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,...You're certainly... confident...
5-female_removing_minor,target:emi,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:wave,direction:down=smile,We're a bit of an up-and-coming group, but I think you'd love the tracks with Number Two or Number Six as the leads.
5-female_removing_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Though, to be honest, with the size of your outift... could've convinced me!
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Maybe if you hum or sang, this'd be easier for you? I'd be happy to join you as backing vocals!
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,I'm a fan of long gloves like those. They just look <i>so</i> pretty!
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Go for it! I'm admittedly a little jealous... a soldier, a singer... you can really--
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=sing,Would it help you if we sang something, Florina?
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=zettai,You've got a good friend, Florina!
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:fled_lyn,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,direction:down=crush,You've got a good <i>friend</i>, Florina!
5-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=why,Florina-- your clothes! You're--
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... Earth to Futaba...?
5-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
5-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
5-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
5-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
5-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
5-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I prefer to be a little more dressed... but it was a great look for you!
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
5-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
5-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I was a pretty effective student... but... (<i>I don't think I'd have been bold enough to come to a game like this.</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,S-sorry, Natsuki! I wasn't staring, just... (<i>Think think think, and don't stereotype her, Sakura!</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>She'd be quite charming if she weren't so abrasive...</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
5-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
5-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
5-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
5-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
5-female_removed_minor,direction:down=crush,Don't worry, ~name~! Seriously! I have the worst luck in the world, but you're still breathing! Don't give up!
5-female_removed_minor,direction:down=happy,I know I'm a little... different looking! But I think that helps ~name~'s beauty stand out-- especially without her ~clothing~!
5-female_removed_minor,direction:down=sing,It's the Legendary ~name~ and her Legendary ~Clothing~! See, ~name~? Everyone's got <i>some</i> sort of legend to them!
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
5-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
5-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
5-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
5-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,A-all you'd... r-really... sing and dance. Goodness, you look cute like this...
5-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,O-oh! What a mess! Come over here, let me fix that for you...
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Does-- does that happen to you all the time, Florina?
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
5-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!
5-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
5-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
5-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
5-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
5-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,I... wasn't coming here your idea...? Why'd you want to leave halfway?
5-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...
5-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
5-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down to the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!
5-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Uh, sure sure, Remilia. Um, Sakuya, how'd you do that? That's a super neat trick!
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Oh, and by the way, your glasses are super cute, Saki! They really bring out your eyes!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't be shy, Sayaka! We're here to help people, remember...? Though getting to wear cute outfits is a big plus in my book.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Okay, girls with pink hair and ribbons have <i>got</i> to have lots in common, right, Sayori?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,T-that makes this a little weirder than I wanted...
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,I'd expect nothing less from my "sis," anyway. (<i>That's probably a little too personal, but she</i> does<i> look like me.</i>)
5-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,<i>Now</i> I get it! You remind me of Yugiri! But she goes by Franchouchou #5!
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,<i>You are just too cute, Shimakaze! I wanna take you home and protect you!</i>


#lost bra
6-male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,I might be the zombie, but you're a little bewitching, ~name~.
6-male_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,Franchouchou's <i>totally</i> not supposed to do stuff like this. But, I'm sure I can make this into a song, later.
6-male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm undead doesn't mean I don't like to feel a heartbeat. Um. I can't do something weird like track heartbeats or whatever like those movies.
6-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I bet Natsuki and Akko-chan have some suggestions for things they'd like to dress you in.
6-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I just meant the rebellious types usually prefer Number Two. In Franchouchou... my idol group.
6-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Franchouchou tends to like more bright, upbeat stuff, but I think the gothic lolita look would be <i>killer</i> on some of our girls.
6-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=crush,(<i>At least the boys here are cute... and they'd probably understand me...</i>)
6-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,O-oh! A-as zombies, we're never supposed to unwind our bandages...
6-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,T-the bandages again!
6-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=hum,Uh huh.
6-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
6-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I'd bet you'd look good in just about everything.
6-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:saki_zls,direction:down=sing,Saki! Ryuji looks like a perfect fan for you!
6-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Oh... did you hurt yourself, Ryuji...?
6-male_removed_minor,direction:down=hum,(<i>What's that pickup line...?</i>) Hey, ~name~, are you a zombie? Because I think I can see us stitched together. Ehehe. Sorry, sorry, too morbid for an Idol?
6-male_removed_minor,direction:down=smile,I always put my career before just about everything. But... I'm really enjoying ~name~ without his ~clothing~.
6-male_removed_minor,direction:down=sing,Call it a reflex, but I just kind of want to dance on over to ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~ on the floor.
6-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Sorry for rambling. You're just getting me in a technical mood, 9S!
6-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=hum,(<i>And they get along so well... gosh, between Pit's can-do attitude and 9S being... adaptable...</i>)
6-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,Sorry, just thinking of all the weird things that can happen...
6-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You are... almost absurdly good looking, Kamina.
6-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
6-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,(<i>We're the relatable ones in our idol groups, Pit, you have to be flexible for the fans.</i>)
6-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Aww, there's nothing wrong with loving idol music, Ryuji! But... I can keep a secret if you're embarrassed.
6-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince,direction:down=smile,(<i>Poor guy...</i>) Ryuji, do you... I'm supposed to be emotional support, but if you need to lean on me, I wouldn't mind...
6-female_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,Franchouchou's not afraid to get tough! The best way of being cute is when you can back it up with some fangs, ~name~!
6-female_removing_minor,direction:down=hum,There's all kinds of stuff to enjoy in Saga, ~name~! Your ~clothing~'s perfect for most weather.
6-female_removing_minor,direction:down=huh,I've been through quite some harrowing stuff, so, really, losing your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~n't the end of the world, ~name~...
6-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.
6-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,Well, no matter what they're for, they look super cool!
6-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
6-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...

6-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
6-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!
6-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...

6-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.

6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,T-that makes this a little weirder than I wanted...
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,I'd expect nothing less from my "sis," anyway. (<i>That's probably a little too personal, but she</i> does<i> look like me.</i>)

-3-male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,I might be the zombie, but you're a little bewitching, ~name~.
-3-male_removing_minor,direction:down=smile,Franchouchou's <i>totally</i> not supposed to do stuff like this. But, I'm sure I can make this into a song, later.
-3-male_removing_minor,direction:down=crush,Just because I'm undead doesn't mean I don't like to feel a heartbeat. Um. I can't do something weird like track heartbeats or whatever like those movies.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=hum,Oh really? I bet Natsuki and Akko-chan have some suggestions for things they'd like to dress you in.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-saki_zls:0,direction:down=huh,O-oh! I just meant the rebellious types usually prefer Number Two. In Franchouchou... my idol group.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,direction:down=crush,Franchouchou tends to like more bright, upbeat stuff, but I think the gothic lolita look would be <i>killer</i> on some of our girls.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=crush,(<i>At least the boys here are cute... and they'd probably understand me...</i>)

-3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.

-3-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...

-3-female_removing_minor,target:emi,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:wave,direction:down=smile,We're a bit of an up-and-coming group, but I think you'd love the tracks with Number Two or Number Six as the leads.

-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Maybe if you hum or sang, this'd be easier for you? I'd be happy to join you as backing vocals!

-3-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!

-3-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
-3-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)

-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
-3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=crush,Oh, well, that’s no miracle, but it’s something I’m longing to feel. Y-you know, normal!
-3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=zettai,Would you believe it? She's even cuter without that! Way to go, ~name~!
-3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=sing,There's not a thing to fear! Not a single one! That's how Franchouchou does it, ~name~!

-2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We usually use the small, backless gloves in Franchouchou, but I find the long type super stylish.

-2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh my God. Her butt is incredible. How does anyone look like that?</i>) C-Catria...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,In China, do you guys have the same kind of idol bands that we do in Japan? I know Korea has their boy and girl groups, but mostly you hear about Chinese singers as single units...

-2-female_removing_minor,target:emi,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:wave,direction:down=smile,We're a bit of an up-and-coming group, but I think you'd love the tracks with Number Two or Number Six as the leads.

-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Um... Earth to Futaba...?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2,direction:down=zettai,That's great! I know I needed a while to come to terms with my appearance...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's hard to find styles for our body type. You know, chesty girls with hips?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,Darn. And I just got done praising that jacket!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...</i>)

-2-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I prefer to be a little more dressed... but it was a great look for you!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,I was a pretty effective student... but... (<i>I don't think I'd have been bold enough to come to a game like this.</i>)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!

-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>She'd be quite charming if she weren't so abrasive...</i>)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)

-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
-2-female_removed_minor,direction:down=sing,A-ah! ~Name~! You're-- you're off the beat!
-2-female_removed_minor,direction:down=smile,I guess every girl wants to be open to new experiences. Being an idol sure introduces you to a lot of them!
-2-female_removed_minor,direction:down=why,U-uhm. It's... it's okay because we're both girls, right? (<i>N-nevermind that I'm a zombie!</i>)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,You look a lot cuter like this, Estelle...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,N-not the most idol-thing for me to say but... you look cute all mussed up.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!

-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,I... wasn't coming here your idea...? Why'd you want to leave halfway?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down to the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Uh, sure sure, Remilia. Um, Sakuya, how'd you do that? That's a super neat trick!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Oh, and by the way, your glasses are super cute, Saki! They really bring out your eyes!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't be shy, Sayaka! We're here to help people, remember...? Though getting to wear cute outfits is a big plus in my book.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Okay, girls with pink hair and ribbons have <i>got</i> to have lots in common, right, Sayori?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,T-that makes this a little weirder than I wanted...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,I'd expect nothing less from my "sis," anyway. (<i>That's probably a little too personal, but she</i> does<i> look like me.</i>)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,<i>Now</i> I get it! You remind me of Yugiri! But she goes by Franchouchou #5!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,<i>You are just too cute, Shimakaze! I wanna take you home and protect you!</i>

-1-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,S-sorry, Natsuki! I wasn't staring, just... (<i>Think think think, and don't stereotype her, Sakura!</i>)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>She'd be quite charming if she weren't so abrasive...</i>)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,(<i>I wonder what kind of trick she could be talking about. Probably a really great song or alluring dance, right?</i>
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,I... actually really dislike the <i>meido</i>-type outfits we have to wear on stage sometimes...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,(<i>But...</i>) H-huh? Seriously, how are you doing that magic trick?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I shouldn't tell her I can see her underwear... it'd be best not to freak her out.</i>)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,We're both just trying to help people live happy lives, right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Girls with ribbons should really stick together, right, Sayori?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smile,Pink hair, blue eyes, ribbon, schoolgirl charm...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Ah! That's a smart play!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,...P-personality...!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,I should probably be a lot more worried about this, but... dang, does she pull this off gracefully!
-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=zettai,You're-- you're amazing! You still had your ~clothing~! I hardly even noticed! I couldn't keep my eyes off you!
-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=crush,You're still kind of being defensive, ~name~. Just let go and enjoy things! Life's a lot happier when you do that.
-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=why,I think I'll stick to singing and dancing. I've got the worst luck for games like this.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,But... they really feel a little... matrimonial.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sisters,direction:down=doubt,<i>Yeah...</i> I'm starting to feel like I got tricked into coming here too.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,R-really? Is it that cold...? I... wouldn't make you, but I'd ask you to be brave, Catria!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Your boobs... b-but, what about b-butt... your butt, Catria! It's-- it's amazing! <i>Sugoi-mazing</i>!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,That't interesting! But... I think you can at least kick some butt tonight.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:coco,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,(<i>At least that reduces her height advantage... even a little!</i>)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,They're... just as confident as you are!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,You look a lot cuter like this, Estelle...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:estelle,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,N-not the most idol-thing for me to say but... you look cute all mussed up.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,...Plus, life's more fun when you put away your armor, right?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Especially when it's a pretty singer like Florina who's wearing them.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,It's really impressive to someone who's really only good for singing and dancing...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Gah! I spoke too soon! Florina, are you okay?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:tripped,direction:down=ohno,Florina, are you okay!? You scared me!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Does-- does that happen to you all the time, Florina?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-10,direction:down=smile,That's the spirit, Florina!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=huh,(<i>I'm just glad I didn't get to see Florina become Zombie #7 with that bee...</i>)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,direction:down=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,I guess I'll just let her enjoy the music, then.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,It's kind of hard to feel pretty when you're undead. So, at least you have a pulse and a heartbeat you can enjoy, right?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,Most of the idol outfits Franchouchou gets are for smaller frames. But Number Five has even bigger boobs than me. Even bigger than yours, Haru!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6,direction:down=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Idols don't score points for nudity, generally!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,Well, I decided to become an idol. I bet you have a ton of awesome accomplishments too, though!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=hum,You're quite the handsome lady! Very sharp!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,You're quite the poet, aren't you? I bet you'd be into something more like rap than pop music, right?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,I... wasn't coming here your idea...? Why'd you want to leave halfway?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,How do you make yourself comfortable? The imagery, for some reason just...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down to the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Uh, sure sure, Remilia. Um, Sakuya, how'd you do that? That's a super neat trick!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Oh, and by the way, your glasses are super cute, Saki! They really bring out your eyes!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,Don't be shy, Sayaka! We're here to help people, remember...? Though getting to wear cute outfits is a big plus in my book.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=zettai,Okay, girls with pink hair and ribbons have <i>got</i> to have lots in common, right, Sayori?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,T-that makes this a little weirder than I wanted...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,I'd expect nothing less from my "sis," anyway. (<i>That's probably a little too personal, but she</i> does<i> look like me.</i>)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,<i>Now</i> I get it! You remind me of Yugiri! But she goes by Franchouchou #5!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,<i>You are just too cute, Shimakaze! I wanna take you home and protect you!</i>




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major,direction:down=happy,Your ~clothing~’s quite a thrill, ~name~!
male_removing_major,direction:down=sing,You know, it’s impossible to never lose! But if you act as a bright example to others, is it really so bad?
male_removing_major,direction:down=smile,I'm not super competive but it's like, 'hey, hello, ~name~'s ~clothing~ is coming off, and I can't not get excited' y'know?
male_removed_major,direction:down=hum,You're pretty cute, ~name~! I bet the ladies--or boys--can't keep their hands off you!
male_removed_major,direction:down=huh,That was... super really dang quick! You aren't trying to get naked... uh, are you?
male_removed_major,direction:down=crush,That was a pretty big play, ~name~! I'm glad I've never had a wardrobe malfunction like that... (<i>But, people love to eat up those videos on idols making mistakes...</i>)
female_removing_major,direction:down=huh,(<i>Whoa! She's taking off her ~clothing~! All eyes are on her! Even mine!</i>) G-good job, ~name~! Um. Just... s-stay confident!
female_removing_major,direction:down=hum,You can just reach for your next goal, ~name~!
female_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,I know it's something big, but it takes a lot of guts and nerve to take that off! Show us your stuff, ~name~, even if it's literally your stuff!
female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,It’s a little unreasonable to get a hand without a scratch. Um, in life, in poker, or in… other ways!
female_removed_major,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Is she really...? I mean, it's <i>so</i> early! I'm not used to this sort of performance.</i>) Kind of a struggle for you, huh, ~name~?
female_removed_major,direction:down=smile,Don't worry, ~name~! ~clothing.ifPlural(those ~clothing~ were|that ~clothing~ was)~ probably just weighing you down! You're still really in this! Franchouchou Number One has your back!

0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,9S... how do you feel about older, confident women?
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Well, I bet he's pretty big where it counts, Pit!
0-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
0-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!

0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Huh! You must be... sort of like me! We have a weird collection of idols tonight, but that won't stop us!
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Just... curious about what kind of boys would like idols like me, is all... (<i>Think, Sakura, you could shape him. Train him to use that robot body exactly how you want...</i>)
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
0-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
0-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
0-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
0-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
0-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
0-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
0-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
0-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
0-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?

0-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
0-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
0-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
0-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
0-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
0-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Well, you're... certainly very-- I-- you're quite good if--
0-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
0-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...

0-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,But if you were-- how did-- <i>what</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
0-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
0-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...

0-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
0-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
0-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
0-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,I hate guns. Please. Please, never, ever do that again!
0-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
0-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
0-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
0-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
0-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
0-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
0-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
0-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)

1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!

1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.

1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!

2-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.

2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,S-Sayaka, you can't just flash people like that! Oh no!
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
2-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,Well, what girl doesn't like a little aft play, right? Ehehe.

#lost makeup
3-male_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,I'm max hyped for this!
3-male_removing_major,direction:down=sing,Let your flag fly high!
3-male_removing_major,direction:down=crush,Aww, c'mon, ~name~, at least you knew you'd be getting naked tonight!
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,J-just hypothetically. In a technical way.
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,9S... how do you feel about older, confident women?
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Well, I bet he's pretty big where it counts, Pit!
3-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
3-male_removed_major,direction:down=hum,I was like <i>oh no my makeup</i>! And then he was like "oh hey don't worry my ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ are|~clothing~'s)~ coming off!"
3-male_removed_major,direction:down=sing,Never gonna stop, so gotta proceed, and keep going! I’m giving it my all, ~name~!
3-male_removed_major,direction:down=ohno,(<i>W-wow! It's nice to have male fans, but he's really something!</i>)
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Huh! You must be... sort of like me! We have a weird collection of idols tonight, but that won't stop us!
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Just... curious about what kind of boys would like idols like me, is all... (<i>Think, Sakura, you could shape him. Train him to use that robot body exactly how you want...</i>)
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
3-female_removing_major,direction:down=hum,With ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~|a ~clothing~)~ like that, I wouldn't have figured you were into idol stuff. It's pretty cool, just... maybe more practical than I was expecting?
3-female_removing_major,direction:down=sing,Well, I’d tell you to wish for it, but… I’m not really here to sing <i>Mezame returner,</i> um. Yet, anyway!
3-female_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,Look at me, ~name~! I haven't given up yet, and neither should you! (<i>I may be nervous, but I'm not letting her down! That's a Franchouchou Saga promise!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
3-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
3-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
3-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
3-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?
3-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=ohno,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>I could do it, could I get an extra layer?</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
3-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
3-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Well, you're... certainly very-- I-- you're quite good if--
3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait wait wait, what?! She's totally serious about the superhero thing!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,W-wait! Too big! Too big too--

3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,"Her?"
3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01,targetSayingMarker:Undies02,direction:down=ohno,O-Oh! You <i>were</i> a woman! I didn't want to assume---
3-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,But if you were-- how did-- <i>what</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>And she's so excited about it!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
3-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
3-female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,Even though your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ gone, we can keep your spirit up together, ~name~! Keep getting back up, and don't lose your head!
3-female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,You know what they say, the wind is always blowing from somewhere, no matter what! So catch a hold of that wind and let it carry you!
3-female_removed_major,direction:down=smile,I might be a little... mortally challenged, but I'm still a <i>little</i> fashionable. And I can tell ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~ was really special!
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
3-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
3-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
3-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
3-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
3-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
3-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
3-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
3-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Gah! It's a gag! (<i>Of course it is, stupid zombie!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
3-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still kicking your butt!
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
3-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
3-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
3-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
3-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
3-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
3-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,S-Sayaka, you can't just flash people like that! Oh no!
3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
3-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!

4-male_removing_major,direction:down=sing,Let your flag fly high!
4-male_removing_major,direction:down=crush,Aww, c'mon, ~name~, at least you knew you'd be getting naked tonight!
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,J-just hypothetically. In a technical way.
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,9S... how do you feel about older, confident women?
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Well, I bet he's pretty big where it counts, Pit!
4-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
4-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!

4-male_removed_major,direction:down=hum,I was like <i>oh no my makeup</i>! And then he was like "oh hey don't worry my ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ are|~clothing~'s)~ coming off!"
4-male_removed_major,direction:down=sing,Never gonna stop, so gotta proceed, and keep going! I’m giving it my all, ~name~!
4-male_removed_major,direction:down=ohno,(<i>W-wow! It's nice to have male fans, but he's really something!</i>)
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Huh! You must be... sort of like me! We have a weird collection of idols tonight, but that won't stop us!
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Just... curious about what kind of boys would like idols like me, is all... (<i>Think, Sakura, you could shape him. Train him to use that robot body exactly how you want...</i>)
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
4-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
4-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
4-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
4-female_removing_major,direction:down=hum,With ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~|a ~clothing~)~ like that, I wouldn't have figured you were into idol stuff. It's pretty cool, just... maybe more practical than I was expecting?
4-female_removing_major,direction:down=sing,Well, I’d tell you to wish for it, but… I’m not really here to sing <i>Mezame returner,</i> um. Yet, anyway!
4-female_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,Look at me, ~name~! I haven't given up yet, and neither should you! (<i>I may be nervous, but I'm not letting her down! That's a Franchouchou Saga promise!</i>)
4-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
4-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
4-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
4-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
4-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
4-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?
4-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=ohno,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>I could do it, could I get an extra layer?</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
4-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
4-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
4-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
4-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
4-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
4-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
4-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!

4-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
4-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
4-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait wait wait, what?! She's totally serious about the superhero thing!</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,W-wait! Too big! Too big too--

4-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
4-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
4-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...
4-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>And she's so excited about it!</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
4-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
4-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
4-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
4-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
4-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
4-female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,Even though your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ gone, we can keep your spirit up together, ~name~! Keep getting back up, and don't lose your head!
4-female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,You know what they say, the wind is always blowing from somewhere, no matter what! So catch a hold of that wind and let it carry you!
4-female_removed_major,direction:down=smile,I might be a little... mortally challenged, but I'm still a <i>little</i> fashionable. And I can tell ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~ was really special!
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
4-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
4-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
4-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
4-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
4-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
4-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
4-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
4-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
4-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
4-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Gah! It's a gag! (<i>Of course it is, stupid zombie!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
4-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still kicking your butt!
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
4-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
4-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
4-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
4-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
4-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
4-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
4-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
4-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
4-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,S-Sayaka, you can't just flash people like that! Oh no!
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?

4-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
4-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
4-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,Well, what girl doesn't like a little aft play, right? Ehehe.

5-male_removing_major,direction:down=sing,Let your flag fly high!
5-male_removing_major,direction:down=crush,Aww, c'mon, ~name~, at least you knew you'd be getting naked tonight!
5-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,J-just hypothetically. In a technical way.
5-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,9S... how do you feel about older, confident women?
5-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Well, I bet he's pretty big where it counts, Pit!
5-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
5-male_removed_major,direction:down=hum,I was like <i>oh no my makeup</i>! And then he was like "oh hey don't worry my ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~ are|~clothing~'s)~ coming off!"
5-male_removed_major,direction:down=sing,Never gonna stop, so gotta proceed, and keep going! I’m giving it my all, ~name~!
5-male_removed_major,direction:down=ohno,(<i>W-wow! It's nice to have male fans, but he's really something!</i>)
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Huh! You must be... sort of like me! We have a weird collection of idols tonight, but that won't stop us!
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Just... curious about what kind of boys would like idols like me, is all... (<i>Think, Sakura, you could shape him. Train him to use that robot body exactly how you want...</i>)
5-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
5-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
5-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
5-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
5-female_removing_major,direction:down=hum,With ~clothing.ifPlural(~clothing~|a ~clothing~)~ like that, I wouldn't have figured you were into idol stuff. It's pretty cool, just... maybe more practical than I was expecting?
5-female_removing_major,direction:down=sing,Well, I’d tell you to wish for it, but… I’m not really here to sing <i>Mezame returner,</i> um. Yet, anyway!
5-female_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,Look at me, ~name~! I haven't given up yet, and neither should you! (<i>I may be nervous, but I'm not letting her down! That's a Franchouchou Saga promise!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
5-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
5-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
5-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
5-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
5-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?

5-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
5-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
5-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
5-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
5-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
5-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
5-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)

5-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
5-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!

5-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
5-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
5-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait wait wait, what?! She's totally serious about the superhero thing!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,W-wait! Too big! Too big too--

5-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
5-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
5-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
5-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>And she's so excited about it!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
5-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
5-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
5-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
5-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
5-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
5-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
5-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
5-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
5-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
5-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
5-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
5-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
5-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
5-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
5-female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,Even though your ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ gone, we can keep your spirit up together, ~name~! Keep getting back up, and don't lose your head!
5-female_removed_major,direction:down=happy,You know what they say, the wind is always blowing from somewhere, no matter what! So catch a hold of that wind and let it carry you!
5-female_removed_major,direction:down=smile,I might be a little... mortally challenged, but I'm still a <i>little</i> fashionable. And I can tell ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~ was really special!
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
5-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
5-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
5-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
5-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
5-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
5-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
5-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
5-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
5-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
5-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
5-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
5-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
5-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!
5-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Gah! It's a gag! (<i>Of course it is, stupid zombie!</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
5-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
5-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still kicking your butt!
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
5-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
5-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
5-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
5-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
5-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
5-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
5-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
5-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
5-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
5-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,S-Sayaka, you can't just flash people like that! Oh no!
5-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
5-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
5-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
5-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...

6-male_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,Ready, go!
6-male_removing_major,direction:down=happy,~Clothing~? That <i>has</i> to be a relief to get off. I know I <i>love</i> my show outfits. But... they're fun to take off too.
6-male_removing_major,direction:down=crush,S-so, you can see me, ~name~. Do you wanna show off for Number One?
6-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,J-just hypothetically. In a technical way.
6-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,9S... how do you feel about older, confident women?
6-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Well, I bet he's pretty big where it counts, Pit!
6-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
6-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
6-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
6-male_removed_major,direction:down=smile,The first rule of being an idol is to get people excited and keep them happy. You're r-really doing that for me, ~name~!
6-male_removed_major,direction:down=sing,The Legendary ~Name~'s Legendary ~Clothing~! If we did have a song, what would it be about, ~name~?
6-male_removed_major,direction:down=huh,Hm! Don't be shy, ~name~! I'm... um... already more undressed than you, y-you know!
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Huh! You must be... sort of like me! We have a weird collection of idols tonight, but that won't stop us!
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Just... curious about what kind of boys would like idols like me, is all... (<i>Think, Sakura, you could shape him. Train him to use that robot body exactly how you want...</i>)
6-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
6-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
6-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
6-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
6-female_removing_major,direction:down=smile,A little bit of this, a little bit of ~clothing.ifPlural(those|her)~ ~clothing~, and it'll all be okay, right?
6-female_removing_major,direction:down=smile,I might be a little... different, but as an idol and as your friend, ~name~, there's no way I'm going to let you get down about this!
6-female_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,Take off whatever you want, ~name~! But even if it's your ~clothing~! You have to keep on your bright smile and excited eyes!
6-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
6-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
6-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
6-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
6-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
6-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
6-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?
6-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=ohno,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>I could do it, could I get an extra layer?</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
6-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
6-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
6-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
6-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
6-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
6-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
6-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
6-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
6-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!
6-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Well, you're... certainly very-- I-- you're quite good if--
6-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
6-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
6-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
6-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait wait wait, what?! She's totally serious about the superhero thing!</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,W-wait! Too big! Too big too--
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,You're really lucky to have someone that gets to--wants to--undress you, Crown Prince...
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,"Her?"
6-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01,targetSayingMarker:Undies02,direction:down=ohno,O-Oh! You <i>were</i> a woman! I didn't want to assume---
6-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,But if you were-- how did-- <i>what</i>?
6-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
6-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
6-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
6-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
6-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
6-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
6-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...
6-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>And she's so excited about it!</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
6-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
6-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
6-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
6-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
6-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
6-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
6-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
6-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
6-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
6-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
6-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
6-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
6-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
6-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
6-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
6-female_removed_major,direction:down=sing,You're not dead yet, ~name~! And even if you lose, you'll at least understand yourself a bit better, huh?
6-female_removed_major,direction:down=huh,W-wow, ~name~. (<i>Wait a minute, what the heck? Am I checking her out? That's not something an idol's supposed to do to her fans!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,direction:down=crush,I wish you were with me. Um, in terms of undress, you know?
6-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
6-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
6-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
6-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
6-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
6-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
6-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
6-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
6-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
6-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
6-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
6-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
6-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
6-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!
6-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Gah! It's a gag! (<i>Of course it is, stupid zombie!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
6-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
6-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
6-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=rap,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still in this!
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
6-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
6-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
6-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
6-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
6-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
6-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
6-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
6-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
6-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
6-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
6-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
6-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
6-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
6-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
6-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
6-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
6-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
6-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
6-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
6-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
6-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
6-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
6-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:10,direction:down=why,S-so many bra malfunctions tonight...
6-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
6-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
6-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
6-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
6-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
6-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
6-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!
6-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,Well, what girl doesn't like a little aft play, right? Ehehe.

-3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Well, I bet he's pretty big where it counts, Pit!
-3-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,I suppose you're wondering about <i>other</i> skills, huh...?
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,We can't wait to see you, Ryuji!
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,direction:down=zettai,Show us your stuff, Ryuji! You're gonna kick some butt! For real!
-3-male_removed_major,direction:down=smile,The first rule of being an idol is to get people excited and keep them happy. You're r-really doing that for me, ~name~!
-3-male_removed_major,direction:down=sing,The Legendary ~Name~'s Legendary ~Clothing~! If we did have a song, what would it be about, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_major,direction:down=huh,Hm! Don't be shy, ~name~! I'm... um... already more undressed than you, y-you know!
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,direction:down=sing,Huh! You must be... sort of like me! We have a weird collection of idols tonight, but that won't stop us!
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,Just... curious about what kind of boys would like idols like me, is all... (<i>Think, Sakura, you could shape him. Train him to use that robot body exactly how you want...</i>)
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
-3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
-3-female_removing_major,direction:down=smile,A little bit of this, a little bit of ~clothing.ifPlural(those|her)~ ~clothing~, and it'll all be okay, right?
-3-female_removing_major,direction:down=smile,I might be a little... different, but as an idol and as your friend, ~name~, there's no way I'm going to let you get down about this!
-3-female_removing_major,direction:down=zettai,Take off whatever you want, ~name~! But even if it's your ~clothing~! You have to keep on your bright smile and excited eyes!
-3-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
-3-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
-3-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
-3-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
-3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
-3-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?
-3-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=ohno,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>I could do it, could I get an extra layer?</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
-3-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
-3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
-3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
-3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
-3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
-3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Well, you're... certainly very-- I-- you're quite good if--
-3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait wait wait, what?! She's totally serious about the superhero thing!</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,W-wait! Too big! Too big too--

-3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
-3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
-3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
-3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
-3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
-3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...
-3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>And she's so excited about it!</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
-3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
-3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
-3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
-3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
-3-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
-3-female_removed_major,direction:down=sing,You're not dead yet, ~name~! And even if you lose, you'll at least understand yourself a bit better, huh?
-3-female_removed_major,direction:down=huh,W-wow, ~name~. (<i>Wait a minute, what the heck? Am I checking her out? That's not something an idol's supposed to do to her fans!</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,direction:down=crush,I wish you were with me. Um, in terms of undress, you know?
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
-3-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
-3-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
-3-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
-3-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
-3-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
-3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
-3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
-3-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
-3-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
-3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
-3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
-3-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)

-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!

-3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=rap,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still in this!
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
-3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
-3-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
-3-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
-3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
-3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
-3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
-3-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
-3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
-3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
-3-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
-3-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
-3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
-3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:10,direction:down=why,S-so many bra malfunctions tonight...
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
-3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!
-3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,Well, what girl doesn't like a little aft play, right? Ehehe.

-2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=why,N-not that size is as important as endurance, I mean, imagine if you had a girl with big boobs, but she couldn't stay on top for very long, that'd be unfortuante, r-right? Um...
-2-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,N-never mind. Idols could <i>never</i> admit to... g-go on, Kamina! Glad to see you're inspired, anyway!
-2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:athlete,direction:down=sing,Well, if you're inviting the look, I guess you're doing an idol-level performance, huh?
-2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,You're shy? <i>You're</i> shy? Can you be any cuter, Ryuji-san?
-2-female_removing_major,direction:down=smile,Well, at least you won't be stealing the show, ~name~! I had to really work myself up for this!
-2-female_removing_major,direction:down=happy,I'm guessing everyone else could use an encore, ~name~! We're getting close to your first performance though, huh? (<i>I have my doubts it's a <i>first</i> performance for us, though.</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,targetStatus:not_exposed,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:uniform_end,marker:uniform_end,direction:down=hum,Say, this is kind of a dumb question, but when ~clothing.ifPlural(do|does)~ your ~clothing~ stop being part of a uniform...? Weird question, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=ohno,No no no! Not like this! Not like this!!!
-2-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,You're so creative! I think I recognized that one!
-2-female_removing_major,target:akko,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,Wow! You're really pulling out all the stops!
-2-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:And yes&comma; I'm wearing underwear. I don't know why some people think I don't...,direction:down=huh,Why would anyone think that? (<i>To be fair with a butt like hers, I wouldn't bother either...</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,It's a beautiful dress, Chun-li!
-2-female_removing_major,target:coco,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,If you didn't wear panties, how on Earth would you be at all comfortable?
-2-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=ohno,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>I could do it, could I get an extra layer?</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:22,direction:down=huh,I-I mean, I guess if-- (<i>This feels so weird with how casual she is! They're prosthetics, but--</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no! We can see her underwear! A-and this is even sexier than her just taking off her dress!</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Estelle!
-2-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
-2-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
-2-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...
-2-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Holy crap. You're a total babe.
-2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,Haru! It's going to be okay! I'm right here with you!
-2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,(<i>I'm always so jealous of girls that can just be so sexual! I have needs and wants too! But... as an idol, it's terribly improper.</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=crush,I just... had, like, a stray like, thought, is like, all.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Tell you what, why don't I sign an album or a poster for you, later?
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Are you really going to--
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:NonMagicStrip1,direction:down=smile,A lot of my outfits work that way too! Very clever!
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,O-oh! Well, you're... certainly very-- I-- you're quite good if--
-2-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... (<i>Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
-2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
-2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait wait wait, what?! She's totally serious about the superhero thing!</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,W-wait! Too big! Too big too--
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,You're really lucky to have someone that gets to--wants to--undress you, Crown Prince...
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,"Her?"
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:Undies01,targetSayingMarker:Undies02,direction:down=ohno,O-Oh! You <i>were</i> a woman! I didn't want to assume---
-2-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,But if you were-- how did-- <i>what</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,Me neither, Nagisa! But... hopefully we're more like friends than strangers after this?
-2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
-2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,I'd ask you for a wish, but...
-2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,U-um, everyone, s-should. W-what should we? <i>What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?</i>
-2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,If you wanted, we could <i>totally</i> work on a duet, Nayru! Anything you'd like!
-2-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smile,T-there's... nothing wrong with having a fun time... but idols are supposed to be a <i>little</i> more conservative than...
-2-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0,direction:down=huh,(<i>And she's so excited about it!</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
-2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
-2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
-2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
-2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
-2-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
-2-female_removed_major,direction:down=smile,Jeez, stay on the beat, ~name~, you don't have to rush just because I'm... touching myself...
-2-female_removed_major,direction:down=sing,I want you to touch my heart, ~name~, show me your passion! Um. Not, literally touching my heart though. Just to be clear. I-I’m not about that!
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
-2-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
-2-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
-2-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
-2-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
-2-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
-2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
-2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
-2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
-2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?
-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You look beautiful! Franchouchou #1 is here to back you up! Promise! No matter what, we're here together!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Nobody could actually... be this... right?</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Gah! It's a gag! (<i>Of course it is, stupid zombie!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
-2-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=rap,Well, I may be down... well, I may be out! Um! I'm not defeated in spirit, Your Grace!
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
-2-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
-2-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
-2-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
-2-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
-2-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
-2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
-2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
-2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:10,direction:down=why,S-so many bra malfunctions tonight...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,Well, what girl doesn't like a little aft play, right? Ehehe.

-1-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,targetSaying:What a shame... Palla once said my tunic's the main reason I get chosen as a party member. I wonder what she meant...,direction:down=smile,I'm sure that's not true. You're really good with swords, and spears, and not slaying friendly idols, so I'm sure there's lots of other virtues besides your clothes.

-1-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,You <i>are</i> wearing underwear, right? What is with people and assuming just because you wear a dress, you've got nothing under it?
-1-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,A-anyway, you're certainly very bold!
-1-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,But... before we leave, if you'd like, I could give you some makeup tips. I'm a little <i>too</i> familiar with body stuff, so...

-1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Smart! You'd... not be surprised how many people try to sneak a peek at our panties at Franchouchou concerts.
-1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Hm. She'd look less cute in a sheer bra and thong though...</i>)

-1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,(<i>Wait, wait, no, no! Idols shouldn't indulge in...</i> that.)
-1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,...Are you stupid, Remilia?
-1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,(<i>A girl like her shouldn't get to dress in such cute underwear. It's not suitable.</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=hum,(<i>She's kind of foul, but that's part of the fun, right? Ai and Yugiri are going to flip!</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=huh,Oh gosh, what <i>is</i> she doing?
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=crush,But, I guess, whether you're an idol or not, we're all just girls under our outfits, huh?
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I'm wondering that too! It's a neat trick I'd definitely love to see Franchouchou use... Yugiri would... um...
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,(<i>Wow, she's really nervous!</i>) Aww, come on, Saki... just between us, I bet a cute girl like you's taken off her shirt for her boyfriend, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,W-wow, that's a uniform, really? You made it look so cute.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=hum,Though, most of the stuff I wear on stage isn't <i>that</i> cute. Underwear-wise. Underwise?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,If it helps, you're definitely wearing panties. You don't wear skirts that often, huh...?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=huh,...I was so distracted by your breasts I didn't even notice...
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2,direction:down=why,O-oh, I wouldn't dream of taking those, Sayla! I don't even really like tights. I'm more of a shorts or skirts girl...
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,direction:down=smile,A beach, then strip poker, you sure lead an interesting life, Sayla. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not an idol?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,S-sayori, couldn't you have counted your ribbon?
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,O-Oh no! Shima, are you okay? (<i>I'd just break apart but--</i>)
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,S-so lewd, a girl like her, talking about her aft under fire!
-1-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,This is all very spooky...
-1-female_removed_major,direction:down=smile,I-I wasn't staring! I was-- keeping a keen eye! Just to make sure you didn't need more encouragement!
-1-female_removed_major,direction:down=huh,W-wow! So that's the style these days, huh?
-1-female_removed_major,direction:down=crush,I could never pull off something that cute, ~name~...
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
-1-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
-1-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
-1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=why,O-oh. Your sisters are kind of mean, Catria.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3,direction:down=doubt,I'm jealous... you look so good in stuff you fight in! I wish I looked that good in things I was <i>supposed</i> to look great in.
-1-female_removed_major,target:coco,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,(<i>It doesn't even cover her butt, and with tight jeans like hers... no panties... that'd just be horribly... uncomfortable...</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,id:23,direction:down=hum,I guess that's very true, Emi. If you can't give it your all, why give any of it!
-1-female_removed_major,target:emi,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:pirate,direction:down=doubt,...W-well, do your best life, I guess, Emi... (<i>Talk about a total Lily move...</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,W-well, i-it's almost rude not to look, s-so... (<i>I should at least be honest with her!</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:estelle,targetStage:5,direction:down=crush,Well... I think you're the prettiest girl with pink hair here, Estelle!
-1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,Cute set, Florina! I'd expected a knight like you to be more practical than something so... cute!
-1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... (<i>The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=smile,That's a relief! I was expecting a horrible spider monster or something. Not that I have... other reasons to believe something like that exists!
-1-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Well... think about it. You look fine, but, who doesn't like to get dolled up and feel super max hype about themselves?
-1-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5,direction:down=sing,If it helps, Hanako, Number Three's body is covered in burns, and she's probably the best looking of anyone in Franchouchou.
-1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,Y-y'know, Haru... as an idol, I can't <i>pretend</i> that I'm enjoying this personality... if you know what I mean?

-1-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=why,(<i>Oh no, it's, like, contagious!</i>)

-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3,direction:down=crush,That bra is <i>soooo</i> cute!
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Gah! It's a gag! (<i>Of course it is, stupid zombie!</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:1,direction:down=huh,Y-you... wow! You even have a bra! (<i>And of course it's adorable...</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... (<i>Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
-1-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3,direction:down=huh,--too... thick.  Wow. Whatever diet you're on, I'm now <i>very</i> interested.
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=rap,Well, I may be down... well, I may be out! Um! I'm not defeated in spirit, Your Grace!
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:Undies02,direction:down=calm,As long as you're comfortable, why does it really matter?
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4,direction:down=doubt,Yeah... what an <i>awful</i> scar, Misato...
-1-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=doubt,W-wait a minute! Why were you in a disguise at all! Totally not fair or cool! Um... let's ignore my makeup for the moment...
-1-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smile,My friend Yugiri prefers bindings like those. But... her chest is... w-well, I think she'd be happier in a bra. At least you're nice and compact, Mulan!
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Wait... is that one of those Big Dango Family bras!? I know my good friend Ai <i>loved</i> that jingle!
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,direction:down=ohno,N-not to imply anything untoward, Nagisa!
-1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,As some advice, if you don't mind looking <i>too</i> cute, sew some lacy fabric under the skirt in ruffles. It covers the goods and looks super floofy!
-1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=huh,(<i>So defensive!</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:18,direction:down=crush,I'm such a softie I'd just wish for your freedom or something like that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=crush,Seriously! Idol groups do crossovers all the time, and if you already know how to sing and dance...
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess,direction:down=huh,Nayru...? Hey... Nayru? Are you okay?
-1-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,(<i>They're bigger than mine!</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Why don't you have fun enough for the both of us?
-1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0,direction:down=doubt,S-so, this is <i>really</i> unbecoming for an idol, so I'll... excuse myself... after the next hand, anyway.
-1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,direction:down=sing,(<i>I've got it!</i>) Pinkie, have you ever thought about being a promoter? You'd go far in the idol industry!
-1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=rap,You can't just treat everyone like they're beneath you! You should serve as an example. Especially if you're really a noble. What about the people who look up to you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smile,So, Sakuya, about that drink. <i>I</i> could use another one...
-1-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,No problems here, ma'am! (<i>I'm gonna do it! Next time she loses, I'll ask her for that autograph!</i>)
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,R-Rinkah, you're... we can see your... it's... very wild!
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=zettai,That's <i>amazing!</i> You should've told me you were an idol sooner!
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You know, I think it's okay if you hold onto your uniform a little longer. It's hard to let go of a cool outfit.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:natsuki,direction:down=why,Can't you two just get along? You're making my job really, really hard... (<i>I'm used to fans debating over which member they like most... this is extreme!</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,direction:down=ohno,Um... er... nevermind, then, so sorry to bother you. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,direction:down=hum,You have great taste in underwear. It's cute, but sensible, and functional.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:10,direction:down=why,S-so many bra malfunctions tonight...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Tip from an idol: sew cotton ruffle under your skirts. Um... the non-magical ones. It stops people from seeing your panties. <i>Trust me.</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=zettai,Don't give up, Sayaka! Don't be overcome by despair! You can do this!
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_hope_not_ripped,direction:down=doubt,Tell me about it. How complicated do outfits really need to be?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_make_skirt_ride_up,direction:down=smile,Oh, really? That's a good reason for me not to wear them then, huh?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:sayla_tights_valuable,direction:down=huh,War? Like... an idol war... or a <i>war</i> war? Where are you from, again?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4,direction:down=why,Wow, you must play here a lot if they have rules for you...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=zettai,That's my Sayori! Don't give up! Keep fighting for the things you want!
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=smile,You look so cute, Sayori! It's almost a shame we have to get dressed after this... w-well, not a shame at all, really, but...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=huh,Is that true? It looks just like some of the stuff we wear under our idol outfits...
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,You're okay! Thank goodness!
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6,direction:down=crush,Well, what girl doesn't like a little aft play, right? Ehehe.

male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=smile,Well, I <i>guess</i> for men, it's pretty easy to just show off your chest. I'm certainly enjoying the view.
male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=smile,You've got a nice build, ~name~, but I hope this means you'll want to put on some Franchouchou gear later.
male_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=why,I-I understand it's... certainly... um... (<i>What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?</i>)

female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=why,This feels... very lewd, for some reason.
female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=zettai,They say that large breasts fill your hand, but small ones fill your heart!
female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=hum,U-um. Those look great! A-and kind of unique. To me, anyway. Most of us in Franchouchou are either smaller or bigger, s-so...
female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=huh,W-wow! ~Name~, those are just about the perfect size and shape... (<i>Would it have <i>killed</i> Kotaro to shape me up a bit when he brought me back?</i>)
female_large_chest_is_visible,direction:down=doubt,I don't think having a large bust is all it's cracked up to be. Like, it's really nice in some ways, but you're always jiggly, and random people are always staring...

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=zettai,10/10 on presentation, Nayru!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan,direction:down=crush,That's adorable! It's a little heart! (<i>If my hair still grew, maybe I'd... do that for a special someone...</i>)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,direction:down=huh,I'm... really seeing this, aren't I? W-well, I guess I should do <i>something</i> to make it up to you, Palutena... maybe a song...?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pinkie_pie,direction:down=huh,And so smooth! Is that... the style these days?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,direction:down=doubt,I doubt that very much...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,direction:down=rap,Obviously, you wouldn't wear panties under a leotard. That'd just be silly! It'd ride up and look really stupid. Not to mention, uncomfortable!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=why,T-they're not especially dangerous, but they are especially scary... are you all okay?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,direction:down=why,Meia! Revy! Stop it! Franchouchou isn't about violence!

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka,direction:down=huh,W-Wow! You're really toned. I guess that witch fighting is a great workout.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena,targetSaying:hot springs,direction:down=ohno,<i>Gah!</i> But onsen is supposed to be private, neutral ground! Who would do that!?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena,targetSaying:sensei,direction:down=doubt,...Sheena, I think your manager was taking advantage of you...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena,targetSaying:Volt,direction:down=huh,Oh, are you afraid of lightning too, Sheena? Number Three gets that way too...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze,direction:down=huh,(<i>So smooth!</i>) You must really be a shipgirl, Shimakaze! You're built like a swimmer, after all... r-right down to the details, huh?

3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=smile,Pit, I'd like to think all of our outfits are pretty intricate! But... I guess the boys dressed the part tonight.
3-male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=sing,Careful, ~name~, we wouldn't want your heart to beat out of your chest or anything like that!
3-male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=smile,Wow! You're even cuter than I expected! I could just rest my head on you and feel so safe! Well, the rest of me too, just to be clear.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0,direction:down=hum,Idols really work for their figures too, ~name~! Well, living ones, anyway. (<i>I wonder if he's got a lot of endurance, or that's all for show?</i>)
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0,direction:down=smile,You must work for your figure. Though, as a guy, you'd probably rather I tell you how ripped you look, huh? Well, I'm glad <i>you're</i> ripped, and not... um, ripping.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0,direction:down=hum,Wow! It's nice to see someone with a more cushy body. It seems like everyone in the idol industry is whip-thin or super jacked. But, someone with a little extra just sounds <i>perfect</i> to snuggle.
3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0,direction:down=smile,Aww, don't be so self conscious! I bet you're really comfy to snuggle. Plus, who doesn't love to snack a little bit? I know I have a <i>huge</i> sweet tooth.

3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,direction:down=huh,Are you really an angel? That makes me feel a lot less weird about the zombie thing. Buuut I'd rather have been an angel than a zombie.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=happy,Well... yes, I'm a little curious what you look like, ~name~...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=smile,I just want to confirm something...

3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=crush,S-so, ~name~, is... is <i>that</i> because of me...? I-I sure hope it is.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=hum,I bet you get a lot of compliments, ~name~. But I'm much more of a "show, don't tell," type of girl.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:akko,count-natsuki:1,direction:down=sing,Looks like you're going to have to really practice your endurance tonight, Pit!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,direction:down=why,Take as much time to warm up as you need. I imagine you get pretty hot, after all... if only there was a way to get you off... c-cooled off!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=crush,(<i>Hm... well, if I do have to masturbate... I don't exactly know how sensitive I am since I came back... maybe a robot boyfriend would...</i>)
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji,direction:down=sing,Well, that girl is me, and I'm happy for it!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=zettai,Well, I always tell my fans to celebrate their best assets. I'm sure you have quite the personality to match <i>that</i>, ~name~.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=crush,That's a really big and impressive… thing... I bet you'd really need someone durable to take all of it though...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina,direction:down=zettai,I mean, you're good at running your mouth! So let's see you put your... <i>feelings</i> where your actions are!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=smile,You'd really be surprised how many people expect Franchouchou to flash them. Looks like you're idol-tier in terms of looks, ~name~!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=smile,If it makes you feel better, ~name~, I'm sure yours won't be all that different from mine.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:akko,direction:down=smile,Getting really strappy, aren't you, Akko?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=crush,Whoever they are, I'm sure they'll appreciate you regardless of the size of your breasts.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:coco,direction:down=why,R-really? Are they that important?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:estelle,direction:down=huh,(<i>Whoa! That's really forward for an idol--I--I guess she's really not!</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,direction:down=smile,If it makes you feel better, Florina, I get to see the other girls on my team naked all the time. It's okay to be conscious, but I promise I've seen lots weirder.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetNotSaidMarker:rules,direction:down=zettai,It's okay, Florina! I'm sure you're gorgeous, and I'm sure everyone's going to be nothing but respectful!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,direction:down=smile,Her name... w-well, she goes by Number Four. She's a lot like you, and she's got the best voice of the group!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hanako,direction:down=zettai,You can do it, Hanako! Go for it! Absolutely!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru,direction:down=ohno,S-sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt your intimate moment!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:ini_personality,direction:down=why,T-that said, it's not good to break character, Ini... but I guess if we're all keeping secrets...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna,direction:down=why,She's... you're... really... aggressive about this, aren't you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,direction:down=smile,I think everyone will be too busy watching, Mahiru...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis,direction:down=smile,I liked the gothic, Halloween-look, Mavis!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-9,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mavisselfie,direction:down=huh,Can vampires even show up in pictures?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=zettai,I'm glad we agree, no matter how big your chest is, it's your heart--
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mulan,direction:down=huh,It's like unwrapping a present!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,direction:down=smile,I understand. Don't worry, lots of people adore small chests!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0,direction:down=zettai,It's hard to be different, Natsuki, and it's hard to be brave! I'm proud of you for pushing past your limits!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi,direction:down=sing,When you go home, you'll promise to tell your friends about Franchouchou, won't you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,direction:down=why,What a waste of a cute bra... (<i>Sakura! That's dark magic, priorities, idol, priorities!</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=huh,T-this is the first time you've been naked in front of someone? (<i>Even I've been naked in front of other people!</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena,direction:down=huh,Is... is that a no?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pinkie_pie,direction:down=crush,(<i>It looks like "stockings only" </i>does<i> work.</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,direction:down=rap,Give her body back and stop being obnoxious.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=ohno,Ahhh! (<i>Whatever it is, it's not going to be good!</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy,direction:down=huh,B-but when the game's over... could you sign something of mine?

3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze,direction:down=huh,This was kind of fun but it's getting a little scary!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky,direction:down=huh,L-laugh? Of course not, I just figured...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=crush,I'd ask someone else in Franchouchou... but is it true that having a small chest makes them more sensitive? (<i>It would explain why Junko gets so... nervous sometimes!</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=hum,They're so cute! To be honest, being kind of... busty can be a hassle. (<i>Or a handful, depending on your outlook...</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko,direction:down=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria,direction:down=rap,Okay, seriously, Catria, it's the size of your heart that matters! But... you have an incredible butt! It's amazing, use your butt, Catria! Listen to your heart but use your butt!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,direction:down=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna,direction:down=ohno,(<i>Of course they're damn cute! She's a hologram! Or an AI! Or something! How am I supposed to compete with that?!</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko,direction:down=why,--y-your heart that... Your... your wife's breasts. O-of course... Your Grace.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,direction:down=huh,(<i>For a small girl, she sure knows how to make the cleavage work for her.</i>)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,direction:down=huh,...Whoa. None of the dolls I've ever played with have that level of detail... Navi, could I... hold you in my hands a little? I promise I'd be gentle...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,direction:down=happy,They're amazing! But... if you want to keep them more private, I can hardly blame you. I wouldn't want to share either.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze,direction:down=zettai,W-well, I'm glad you aren't quitting, Shimakaze! Your enthusiasm is infectious!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,direction:down=huh,...I have so many questions I'd never... even thought about before.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=happy,I guess I was a little surprised-- yours are really cute! If I do get naked later, I'd be... um, happy to compare?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=zettai,I'm a bit jealous! You're so put-together. N-not that you were built to be that way. Or that I was. I'm all my original parts. You're cute, ~name~, that's all!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:coco,direction:down=doubt,(<i>Then again, I'd keep my ribbon on the whole time... so...</i>)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:estelle,targetSayingMarker:goodPlayer,id:20,direction:down=smile,Not to shame ~player~, but I think you underestimate how far people are willing to go to help a cute girl out of her bra.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,direction:down=crush,You're so cute... This... has to be a <i>little</i> thrilling, right? (<i>Why do I feel excited to push her out of her comfort zone? I guess idols do want to help people grow...</i>)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetNotSaidMarker:rules,direction:down=rap,And if you want to start something, I'll take you down, and leave you with not <i>one thing.</i> Be nice to Florina, or I'm gonna ream ya!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hanako,direction:down=why,<i>No fair!</i> They're so cute!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini,direction:down=smile,Ini, it's okay if that role is sort of dumb... but you don't need to be mean. We played along, after all.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,direction:down=zettai,Don't be shy! Your freckles look adorable, Mahiru! Unless you meant your... size, I guess?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,direction:down=zettai,Don't be sorry, Nagisa! Even with tears in your eyes, you made it through! Don't worry! I believe in you, and the friendship you're doing this for! That's all anyone can ask!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,direction:down=huh,...Wow, Nayru's really turned on. She hid that super well the last couple of hands...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,Don't be ashamed, Nayru, you have a sparkling personality and lots of talents. The fact your boobs are out doesn't have to be a big deal.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pinkie_pie,direction:down=crush,Pinkie, I think it's fair to say the party started some time ago...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy,direction:down=why,I-I was hoping like... a card... b-but... I'd be lying if I didn't find some appeal...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,direction:down=smile,Don't worry, Saki, they're beautiful, just like the rest of you! (<i>Now there's a statement I really never expected to need to say to </i>my<i> Saki.</i>)

3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mavis,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-9,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mavisselfie,direction:down=why,S-sorry, is that... rude?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan,direction:down=ohno,N-no way! She faked us out!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,direction:down=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences,direction:down=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddesses don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? (<i>So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i></i>)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_there,direction:down=why,I-I'm not staring like I'm <i>attracted</i>. You're just... w-with no bra, do you have something magic to stop your back from hurting?

3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hanako,direction:down=crush,N-no, Hanako, I bet people are actually really excited. I bet it'll be just  like the rest of you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru,direction:down=crush,(<i>She's so confident with her body! What I wouldn't give to </i>do<i> w-what</i>?)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetSayingMarker:butt,direction:down=doubt,Ini... I'm so sorry. But... this is kind of what happens when you play games like this. I'll still support you, though... as an idol...

4-male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=smile,Wow! You're even cuter than I expected! I could just rest my head on you and feel so safe! Well, the rest of me too, just to be clear.

4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0,direction:down=hum,Wow! It's nice to see someone with a more cushy body. It seems like everyone in the idol industry is whip-thin or super jacked. But, someone with a little extra just sounds <i>perfect</i> to snuggle.

4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,direction:down=why,Take as much time to warm up as you need. I imagine you get pretty hot, after all... if only there was a way to get you off... c-cooled off!

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=crush,Whoever they are, I'm sure they'll appreciate you regardless of the size of your breasts.

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,direction:down=smile,If it makes you feel better, Florina, I get to see the other girls on my team naked all the time. It's okay to be conscious, but I promise I've seen lots weirder.

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,direction:down=smile,I think everyone will be too busy watching, Mahiru...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis,direction:down=smile,I liked the gothic, Halloween-look, Mavis!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-9,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mavisselfie,direction:down=huh,Can vampires even show up in pictures?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=zettai,I'm glad we agree, no matter how big your chest is, it's your heart--

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=crush,I'd ask someone else in Franchouchou... but is it true that having a small chest makes them more sensitive? (<i>It would explain why Junko gets so... nervous sometimes!</i>)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=hum,They're so cute! To be honest, being kind of... busty can be a hassle. (<i>Or a handful, depending on your outlook...</i>)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko,direction:down=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!

4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,direction:down=huh,...Whoa. None of the dolls I've ever played with have that level of detail... Navi, could I... hold you in my hands a little? I promise I'd be gentle...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,direction:down=happy,They're amazing! But... if you want to keep them more private, I can hardly blame you. I wouldn't want to share either.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze,direction:down=zettai,W-well, I'm glad you aren't quitting, Shimakaze! Your enthusiasm is infectious!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,direction:down=huh,...I have so many questions I'd never... even thought about before.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=happy,I guess I was a little surprised-- yours are really cute! If I do get naked later, I'd be... um, happy to compare?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=zettai,I'm a bit jealous! You're so put-together. N-not that you were built to be that way. Or that I was. I'm all my original parts. You're cute, ~name~, that's all!

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:estelle,targetSayingMarker:goodPlayer,id:20,direction:down=smile,Not to shame ~player~, but I think you underestimate how far people are willing to go to help a cute girl out of her bra.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,direction:down=crush,You're so cute... This... has to be a <i>little</i> thrilling, right? (<i>Why do I feel excited to push her out of her comfort zone? I guess idols do want to help people grow...</i>)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetNotSaidMarker:rules,direction:down=rap,And if you want to start something, I'll take you down, and leave you with not <i>one thing.</i> Be nice to Florina, or I'm gonna ream ya!

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,Don't be ashamed, Nayru, you have a sparkling personality and lots of talents. The fact your boobs are out doesn't have to be a big deal.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pinkie_pie,direction:down=crush,Pinkie, I think it's fair to say the party started some time ago...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy,direction:down=why,I-I was hoping like... a card... b-but... I'd be lying if I didn't find some appeal...

5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky,direction:down=huh,L-laugh? Of course not, I just figured...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=crush,I'd ask someone else in Franchouchou... but is it true that having a small chest makes them more sensitive? (<i>It would explain why Junko gets so... nervous sometimes!</i>)
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=hum,They're so cute! To be honest, being kind of... busty can be a hassle. (<i>Or a handful, depending on your outlook...</i>)
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko,direction:down=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria,direction:down=rap,Okay, seriously, Catria, it's the size of your heart that matters! But... you have an incredible butt! It's amazing, use your butt, Catria! Listen to your heart but use your butt!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,direction:down=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!

5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=smile,I was so distracted by your... idol... light... show...? That I forgot to remark how petite you are. You're really just trying to talk big because you're so small, right?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,direction:down=happy,They're amazing! But... if you want to keep them more private, I can hardly blame you. I wouldn't want to share either.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze,direction:down=zettai,W-well, I'm glad you aren't quitting, Shimakaze! Your enthusiasm is infectious!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky,direction:down=huh,...I have so many questions I'd never... even thought about before.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=happy,I guess I was a little surprised-- yours are really cute! If I do get naked later, I'd be... um, happy to compare?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=zettai,I'm a bit jealous! You're so put-together. N-not that you were built to be that way. Or that I was. I'm all my original parts. You're cute, ~name~, that's all!

5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,direction:down=crush,You're so cute... This... has to be a <i>little</i> thrilling, right? (<i>Why do I feel excited to push her out of her comfort zone? I guess idols do want to help people grow...</i>)
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetNotSaidMarker:rules,direction:down=rap,And if you want to start something, I'll take you down, and leave you with not <i>one thing.</i> Be nice to Florina, or I'm gonna ream ya!

5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=smile,Don't be ashamed, Nayru, you have a sparkling personality and lots of talents. The fact your boobs are out doesn't have to be a big deal.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pinkie_pie,direction:down=crush,Pinkie, I think it's fair to say the party started some time ago...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy,direction:down=why,I-I was hoping like... a card... b-but... I'd be lying if I didn't find some appeal...

5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan,direction:down=ohno,N-no way! She faked us out!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,direction:down=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences,direction:down=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddesses don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? (<i>So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i></i>)

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:joey,count-uses_camera:1-3,direction:down=doubt,W-well, at least the point of being here is to get naked... better here than on stage... would you people with the cameras seriously stop filming this? It's really uncomfortable.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,direction:down=calm,F-from a certain point of view, I can see the appeal in being clean shaven... w-who wants to have a partner complain about getting hair in their mouth, r-right?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,direction:down=smile,W-well, I think that "bare" look would ruin my image. It's better on sexy, forward types like ~name~. (<i>I bet if Ai knew about this, she'd <i>totally</i> shave.</i>)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed,direction:down=smile,If I knew I was going to be playing this tonight, I'd probably have cleaned up more than usual too.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:coco,direction:down=zettai,That's actually super cute. I bet it's a lot of work, though... and it's not like you're showing that off to everyone, so I suppose that must make it really, really special!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:estelle,direction:down=why,N-no! Not strange at all! Just like my comment. No strangeness here, not at all!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:panties_butt,targetSayingMarker:butt,direction:down=sing,For a girl so worried about showing off her butt, it's a great one! (<i>Don't imagine her leaning forward and spreading her cheeks! W-why am I imaginging that!?</i>)

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5,direction:down=why,Meia! Revy! Stop it! Franchouchou isn't about violence!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

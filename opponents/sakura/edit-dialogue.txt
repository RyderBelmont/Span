#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

okay_hand,marker:sakura_invite=happy,So... I'm usually pretty good with names, but you're all so... unique! What can you tell me about yourselves?
okay_hand=doubt,This hand's just so-so. <Seriously, I had to have taken a wrong turn somewhere, right?>

6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_touch1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_touch1=must_strip+,Well, I can only really feel stuff that’s connected to my body.

6-stripping=stripping+,This is pretty exciting. I'm not used to people finding me attractive when I'm out of my makeup... um... I hope I'm not too different than what you expected...
6-stripping=stripping-,Well... I used to trim this. Apparently after you die, it grows out a little bit. I hope I'm not too off-putting... <Whatever I do, I won't let them think an idol is lazy!>
6-stripping=stripping+,They say that idols these days shave... I used to trim, but... it grows out a bit after you die, so... um... well... <I can't let any of them think their idol is just lazy!>
6-stripping=stripping-,It's not every day an idol shows off her body for you... so... I hope this is as new for you as it is for me.

6-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf2=stripping-,Oh, idols aren't really supposed to date-- Hey! Watch it!
6-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sakura_brina1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_brina2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_brina2=smile,I’m fine, really! It’s just a weird condition. I can still do everything I could when I’m alive! And what’s that supposed to mean? Idols work really hard, you know!
6-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sakura_cum1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_cum2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_cum2=stripping-,Well… I guess if Franchouchou saves Saga, then as an idol, it means everyone’s kind of my family? So I don’t feel sad about it.
6-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sakura_die1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_die2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_die2=stripping+,Oh, not at all! I got hit by another one a few months ago.

6-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sakura_makeup1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_makeup2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_song2=stripping+,We have a really talented makeup artist. He knows how to do a wide variety of looks, too!

6-stripping,saidMarker:7DN=stripping-,I hope this is as new for you as it is for me. I've never... y-you know. I'm confident in how I look, but undressing like <i>this</i> is a first. Lucky you.

#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=why,<Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=smile,You worked so hard on this! I can really see your dedication to your craft... your... uh, witchcraft!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie=why,C-could you not, Akko?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3=hum,Not bad, Akko, but I bet you have some better ones left in the tank, right? <She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2=zettai,That looks so complicated! I bet if it were easy, everyone would do it, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,Um... sorry, no reason. I'm sure you're more used to something like a muse, right...?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Franchouchou is kind of... unique... because... um, we're mostly regional idols... so, if we widened our base... we'd just be happy to meet new fans, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...

3-female_removed_accessory=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
3-female_removed_accessory=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! <I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!>

5-female_removed_accessory=crush,I think ~name~ was making a great statement with her ~clothing~! Even if I had to get down into the skin I... um, well, I was going to say was born in, but <i>reborn</i>... nevermind.
5-female_removed_accessory=smile,It's great to have fans that are so skilled. Like, wow, she still had her ~clothing~! <I'm really regretting not taking Yugiri up on those card lessons...!>
5-female_removed_accessory=happy,I'm going to keep my ribbons on no matter what, ~name~! So, I think it's amazing of you to take off ~clothing.ifPlural(those|that)~ ~clothing~!

5-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!

6-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.

-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=sing,Don't give up now, Kamina! I'm singing you a fight song!
-1-male_removed_accessory=crush,Um, don’t suppose you’d be willing to give that to me? Idols love to collect stuff from their fans. It's not a competition or anything but... <I bet Saki would get a laugh out of this, at least.>
-1-male_removed_accessory=ohno,That said, I can't believe you've still got things like that!
-1-male_removed_accessory=happy,C'mon, ~name~! I don't bite! Seriously. I'm not that kind of zombie. <But... I could... maybe... use my mouth for other things...>
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=happy,But! We want you to try your best to be happy! So, if that involves fighting, we'll match that spirit!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=smile,I may be an idol, but 90% of performing is improvising for your audience. But to look good, you sure have to practice <i>lots</i>.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:8=huh,It would seem that she's not as she appeared!
-1-female_removing_accessory=smile,Wow, way to keep playing well right until the end! But um... don't you think this is getting a little silly?
-1-female_removing_accessory=doubt,Even if I'm a zombie, I <i>can</i> get cold, ~name~.
-1-female_removing_accessory=calm,My fans are really the best! Um... I <i>hope</i> ~name~'s a fan by now, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! You're doing some sort of... costume change... light show?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=why,<Is this how zombies are made? This is... awful...>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSayingMarker:akko_zombie=why,C-could you not, Akko?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:3=hum,Not bad, Akko, but I bet you have some better ones left in the tank, right? <She's smarter than she lets on! Or at least, she's a natural showman, building in the rising and falling arcs...>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=smile,I guess your boots <i>could</i> come off first, but... I was only asking because I wanted to find out if you were a Franchouchou fan or not! I mean, you <i>did</i> come here tonight.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smile,U-uhm. Mahiru, obviously... you won't be taking pictures of us, will you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=why,I see-- um... I see your point but... I see something else too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=calm,You know, your character? Like... in Franchouchou, Number Six is the sultry one, Number Three is the serious one...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,...Consort is putting you under heavy scrutiny.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smile,T-though, I guess we're all... bending one rule or another tonight, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smile,If you're looking for new music, you know, I am in an idol group--
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=smile,Nagisa Furokawa. You can spell your name with one character, right? That's adorable!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=crush,Sorry, if this isn't comfortable for you, I can always look away. I'd hate to embarass you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=ohno,R-really?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=hum,That aside... do gods even watch idols? I bet that'd be super lucky for us if you did!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=rap,Oh, come <i>on!</i> But... uh, speaking of magic, it'd be really worth my time if you let me know...
-1-female_removed_accessory=crush,Well... that wasn't your last item... right? So at least you can keep on going!
-1-female_removed_accessory=hum,<It's just nice that people are treating me like I'm normal!>
-1-female_removed_accessory=zettai,See it through to the very end, and beyond, if you have to, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1=zettai,<i>That</i> was pretty awesome! I wish Franchouchou could just change like that! We could do so many neat things!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:necronomicon=huh,Uh... you... you're still there, right, Akko? You can hear me, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:akko_zombie=doubt,...I didn't sign up for the tsukommi and boke show, Akko.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:akko,targetStage:4=crush,I'm jealous! I know you worked hard for those magic spells, but... you still seem to know how to reach people so much more easily than I do.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=rap,I-Idol music is great! There's no need to be such a snob, Futaba!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=rap,<i>Seriously!</i> I'm an idol, so I'm no stranger to fan photos, but... definitely none of us undressing!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=doubt,Are you trying to... stage some photos, Mahiru? Just... curious.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=smile,...Given your attitude, I bet you'd really like Number Three the most. She's also a serious, forward type.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=rap,You know, Your Grace, just because you're royalty doesn't mean you get to be a royal pain in the butt!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=calm,...Do you... even listen to Franchouchou, Your Grace?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,Tojiko, that was your name, right? I think you're the more sensible one. What's going on here?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=happy,Your friend must be awfully special for you to play a game like this. Don't worry. I'm going to keep you safe! That's an idol's promise!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=sing,But, really, you should be proud! It takes a lot of guts to give something like this a try! Carve your own path, as Number Two would say!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,I really meant to ask you about the undead... but... I guess I don't want to get smote.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smile,Well, we're already sort of dead, so if we could perform in the afterlife, what would the harm really be?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=crush,...I appreciate your sentiment... um, idols thrive on sentiment, after all. But... how does the whole "resurrecting the dead" thing work? I keep trying to understand it but...




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_minor=crush,It's not easy being an Idol, and I know I put a lot of work in. But, ~name~ probably spent a lot of time getting his  ~clothing~ ready for the game, too, huh?
male_removing_minor=smile,I really like stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~! But, I'll admit I just feel so dang pretty in my idol gear.
male_removing_minor=hum,Your ~clothing~ makes me kind of jealous! In Franchouchou, most of our outfits are pretty coordinated.
male_removed_minor=happy,I know Franchouchou's an idol group, but we lean a little bit into heavy metal too! Well, we're great at headbanging, ~name~.
male_removed_minor=calm,Hm? Your ~clothing~? For some reason, I feel like that's something Number Two would wear in her spare time... she's a bit of a rougher, less refined Idol!
male_removed_minor=smile,You know, ~name~, I can't really date, being an Idol and all, but I bet your girlfriend would love to wear your ~clothing~!
female_removing_minor=smile,Your ~clothing~ is so neat, ~name~! Maybe I should pick something like that up for myself? It's not like I've got a super expansive set out of outfits, after all.
female_removing_minor=happy,I always really appreciate the kinds of outfits people wear to Franchouchou concerts! ~Name~'s ~clothing~ ~clothing.ifPlural(are|is)~ pretty amazing!
female_removing_minor=hum,Hm. Idols are really supposed to keep close to a pattern or uniform, so it's easy to recognize us. But, even so, I'd love to work something like ~name~'s ~clothing~ into my wardrobe!
female_removed_minor=calm,<It <i>would</i> be nice to have some more changes of clothes. Cute ~clothing~, at least.>
female_removed_minor=zettai,Saga's a small province, but I hope we can make up for in spirit! Sort of like how ~name~'s ~clothing~'s probably really important to her!
female_removed_minor=huh,I will say, it's not typical that our fans will undress at our concerts...

#lost coat
4-male_removing_minor=crush,Fashion's always been kind of a weak spot for me. I wouldn't have expected ~name~'s stuff to look so cool! Back when I died, you'd have been even more of a trendsetter.
4-male_removing_minor=smile,So... I was in the best shape of my life right before <i>you know</i>, so ~name~'s ~clothing~ would actually look real cute on me!
4-male_removing_minor=why,Y-you aren't just picking your ~clothing~ because you're afraid of me, or something, right, ~name~?
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=why,O-oh! A-as zombies, we're never supposed to unwind our bandages...
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=why,T-the bandages again!
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sing,Kamina, are you <i>sure</i> you're not in some kind of band? You're <i>so</i> into the guy-dol aesthetic.
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=hum,Uh huh.
4-male_removed_minor=doubt,Even though I get to be an idol, sometimes I get <i>super</i> jealous. When you're an Idol, there's all these rules you have to follow. An uh, when you're undead, I guess.
4-male_removed_minor=happy,If the whole "secret zombie" thing wasn't... y'know, a secret, I'd still love to take a picture with you, ~name~!
4-male_removed_minor=zettai,The way I look at it, you stop living only when you stop caring! And trust me when I say that I, and all of Franchouchou, care a lot! Even about stuff like ~name~'s ~clothing~!
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=doubt,Sorry, just thinking of all the weird things that can happen...
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5=crush,You are... almost absurdly good looking, Kamina.
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=zettai,Don't just <i>talk</i> about it! Show us that drill, Kamina!
4-female_removing_minor=smile,Aww, don't worry, ~name~! Let me get you a Franchouchou shirt or jacket to replace your ~clothing~. Promise!
4-female_removing_minor=doubt,It'll be okay, ~name~! Don't give up...! <I want to be enthusiastic! I really do! I just... just her ~clothing~?!>
4-female_removing_minor=zettai,I know you can't put your ~clothing~ back on, ~name~, but it'll come back at the end of the game. Amazing how that works, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4=huh,<I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...>

4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!

4-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
4-female_removed_minor=crush,Don't worry, ~name~! Seriously! I have the worst luck in the world, but you're still breathing! Don't give up!
4-female_removed_minor=happy,I know I'm a little... different looking! But I think that helps ~name~'s beauty stand out-- especially without her ~clothing~!
4-female_removed_minor=sing,It's the Legendary ~name~ and her Legendary ~Clothing~! See, ~name~? Everyone's got <i>some</i> sort of legend to them!
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
4-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!

-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=happy,I really like that jacket! It's well-worn, and so... comfy looking!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:4=huh,<I guess if I had her... <i>everything</i>, it <i>would</i> be a good technique to show off everything first...>
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=smile,It's just kind of hard for flesh and blood-- um... well, <i>fleshy</i>... idols... uhm...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=huh,A-are you not wearing makeup? W-wow!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=sing,It's not <i>armor</i>, but it <i>does</i> help you stay upbeat. That's a promise from Franchouchou #1!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=ohno,G-G-G-G-Ghost!!!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=hum,No...? That's okay! I know this is a weird place to meet, but I bet you'd really enjoy us if you gave us a chance!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=doubt,No need to rub it in, you know?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=smile,Well, maybe not. But they say that humor and horror go really well together. So that puts sex somewhere at that table too? Not like, between them, but maybe at the end of the table?
-2-female_removed_minor=sing,A-ah! ~Name~! You're-- you're off the beat!
-2-female_removed_minor=smile,I guess every girl wants to be open to new experiences. Being an idol sure introduces you to a lot of them!
-2-female_removed_minor=why,U-uhm. It's... it's okay because we're both girls, right? <N-nevermind that I'm a zombie!>
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=hum,Hm... <i>Most</i> of my idol outfits are more comfortable than they look, so there's something to be said about style!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:5=why,Don't damage your clothes, Ai-chan! Outfits are expens-- oh. Right. You're all animation...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,targetStage:6=doubt,...To live up to animation. I guess that's why we need so much extra creativity...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=smile,It's okay, Kyoko. I know it's always a little bit of a surprise, but if it's not hurting you, I promise nobody minds <i>that</i> much. Nobody that matters, anyway.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,Well, you can kind of see what I look like without all my makeup... it's kind of ghoulish... but... you're so naturally pretty!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=crush,...And are you sure you're not more familiar with idol stuff? Your bodysuit's right out of an old-style retro sci-fi idol group. It looks great!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=why,What kind of game <i>is</i> this!?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=smile,When I was... um, in your... what year are you in? I-I was only a second year high school student when I joined Franchouchou, so... I guess you're right on schedule for realizing your dreams!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=smile,W-well, a goddess <i>should</i> be modest, right? Unless you're a lust goddess, but I'm not feeling particularly lustful, anymore than usual-- not that I usually feel lusty. Just busty, I guess.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=zettai,Well, Palutena, you're down the wire! But I've definitely learned to believe in you over the course of the game!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=happy,Your ~clothing~’s quite a thrill, ~name~!
male_removing_major=sing,You know, it’s impossible to never lose! But if you act as a bright example to others, is it really so bad?
male_removing_major=smile,I'm not super competive but it's like, 'hey, hello, ~name~'s ~clothing~ is coming off, and I can't not get excited' y'know?
male_removed_major=hum,You're pretty cute, ~name~! I bet the ladies--or boys--can't keep their hands off you!
male_removed_major=huh,That was... super really dang quick! You aren't trying to get naked... uh, are you?
male_removed_major=crush,That was a pretty big play, ~name~! I'm glad I've never had a wardrobe malfunction like that... <But, people love to eat up those videos on idols making mistakes...>
female_removing_major=huh,<Whoa! She's taking off her ~clothing~! All eyes are on her! Even mine!> G-good job, ~name~! Um. Just... s-stay confident!
female_removing_major=hum,You can just reach for your next goal, ~name~!
female_removing_major=zettai,I know it's something big, but it takes a lot of guts and nerve to take that off! Show us your stuff, ~name~, even if it's literally your stuff!
female_removed_major=happy,It’s a little unreasonable to get a hand without a scratch. Um, in life, in poker, or in… other ways!
female_removed_major=doubt,<is she really...? I mean, it's <i>so</i> early! I'm not used to this sort of performance.> Kind of a struggle for you, huh, ~name~?
female_removed_major=smile,Don't worry, ~name~! That ~clothing~ was probably just weighing you down! You're still really in this! Franchouchou Number One has your back!

-3-female_removing_major=smile,I might be a little... different, but as an idol and as your friend, ~name~, there's no way I'm going to let you get down about this!
-3-female_removing_major=zettai,Take off whatever you want, ~name~! But even if it's your ~clothing~! You have to keep on your bright smile and excited eyes!

-3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=smile,I think it's really impressive how you can keep up your act... <Sakura! Stop ruining it for her! Just enjoy it!>
-3-female_removing_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:2=ohno,It's really weird, but... <i>butt!</i>
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=crush,You... didn't wear shorts or anything, did you? I know some girls do that, but I always found them to be a little sporty...
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=smile,Of course, of course! Take your time!
-3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=crush,You're really lucky to have someone that gets to--wants to--undress you, Crown Prince...

-3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=crush,No problem. Sometimes, the best things are done in the privacy of your home, right?
-3-female_removed_major=sing,You're not dead yet, ~name~! And even if you lose, you'll at least understand yourself a bit better, huh?
-3-female_removed_major=huh,W-wow, ~name~. <Wait a minute, what the heck? Am I checking her out? That's not something an idol's supposed to do to her fans!>
-3-female_removed_major=crush,I wish you were with me. Um, in terms of undress, you know?
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=doubt,I may be a zombie... but... could you not? Seriously?
-3-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:3=crush,You know you have a good show when you've made an <i>idol</i> fixate on your costume... and not your underwear.
-3-female_removed_major,target:akko,targetStage:5=crush,You're so <i>cute!</i> Even as flashy as you can be, you really just like the plain underwear, huh? Maybe that gives you more to build on?
-3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=crush,If you're cold, I could always give you a hug... <The best way to make new fans is to comfort them, and she reminds me a lot of Junko...>

-3-female_removed_major,target:kizuna,targetStage:3=huh,...Franchouchou has had some struggles with CGI animation... for music videos and things like that... <Gosh. They really put a lot of work into her details, didn't they?>
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=zettai,If it makes you feel better, most idols just have lots of lacy fluff under their skirts to stop <i>unwanted</i> photography. Maybe you'd try something like that?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=hum,I think you might want to stick to photos, Mahiru! You aren't much of an actress...
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=ohno,L-Ladybug, w-what was that!?
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=rap,Maybe that's so, Miko, but I'm Franchouchou Number 1, and I'm still in this!
-3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=smile,This is some weird magic thing, right? I may be... um... nevermind. Let's just go to the next hand, why don't we?

male_chest_will_be_visible=huh,W-wow, ~name~! You're-- you're really confident! I'd never just--
male_chest_will_be_visible=why,<He's already taking off his ~clothing~?! Really!? This is r-really lewd for an idol!>
male_chest_is_visible=smile,Well, I <I>guess</i> for men, it's pretty easy to just show off your chest. I'm certainly enjoying the view.
male_chest_is_visible=smile,You've got a nice build, ~name~, but I hope this means you'll want to put on some Franchouchou gear later.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=why,I-I understand it's... certainly... um... <What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?>
male_crotch_will_be_visible=huh,Is--is he really taking out his--
male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:2small=smile,I--I can honestly say you"re very... <i>unique,</i> ~name~! <Just maybe not <i>useful.</i>>
male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:2small=doubt,Um... <Did he really need to go so fast...? At least get to know a girl...>
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=smile,I'd seen one or two before I-- <i>became an idol</i> but... you look nice, ~name~!
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy,Um... this is a little rude, but... you look <i>great</i>, ~name~! I get to say that lots, but very rarely about man's...
male_large_crotch_is_visible=huh,That's a really big and impressive… thing...
male_large_crotch_is_visible=why,G-gosh! ~Name~, I-I haven't seen many, but yours is... impressive.

female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,That was fast... um... you do realize that I'm an idol, not a rock star, right, ~name~?
female_small_chest_is_visible=why,This feels... very lewd, for some reason.
female_small_chest_is_visible=zettai,They say that large breasts fill your hand, but small ones fill your heart!
female_medium_chest_is_visible=hum,U-um. Those look great! A-and kind of unique. To me, anyway. Most of us in Franchouchou are either smaller or bigger, s-so...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=huh,W-wow! ~Name~, those are just about the perfect size and shape... <Would it have <i>killed</i> Kotaro to shape me up a bit when he brought me back?>
female_large_chest_is_visible=doubt,I don't think having a large bust is all it's cracked up to be. Like, it's really nice in some ways, but you're always jiggly, and random people are always staring...
female_large_chest_is_visible=huh,I... it's like looking into a mirror. After putting on makeup... huh.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=why,Seriously? She's going to?
female_crotch_will_be_visible=why,U-um. Th-this isn't <i>really</i> a meet and greet, huh?

4-male_chest_is_visible=sing,Careful, ~name~, we wouldn't want your heart to beat out of your chest or anything like that!
4-male_chest_is_visible=smile,Wow! You're even cuter than I expected! I could just rest my head on you and feel so safe! Well, the rest of me too, just to be clear.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=hum,Idols really work for their figures too, ~name~! Well, living ones, anyway. <I wonder if he's got a lot of endurance, or that's all for show?>
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:athletic,priority:0=smile,You must work for your figure. Though, as a guy, you'd probably rather I tell you how ripped you look, huh? Well, I'm glad <i>you're</i> ripped, and not... um, ripping.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=hum,Wow! It's nice to see someone with a more cushy body. It seems like everyone in the idol industry is whip-thin or super jacked. But, someone with a little extra just sounds <i>perfect</i> to snuggle.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,priority:0=smile,Aww, don't be so self conscious! I bet you're really comfy to snuggle. Plus, who doesn't love to snack a little bit? I know I have a <i>huge</i> sweet tooth.

4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=crush,S-so, ~name~, is... is <i>that</i> because of me...? I-I sure hope it is.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=hum,I bet you get a lot of compliments, ~name~. But I'm much more of a "show, don't tell," type of girl.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=zettai,Well, I always tell my fans to celebrate their best assets. I'm sure you have quite the personality to match <i>that</i>, ~name~.

4-female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,You'd really be surprised how many people expect Franchouchou to flash them. Looks like you're idol-tier in terms of looks, ~name~!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible=smile,If it makes you feel better, ~name~, I'm sure yours won't be all that different from mine.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:akko=smile,Getting really strappy, aren't you, Akko?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=smile,Her name... w-well, she goes by Number Four. She's a lot like you, and she's got the best voice of the group!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=why,She's... you're... really... aggressive about this, aren't you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=smile,I think everyone will be too busy watching, Mahiru...

4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=huh,Is... is that a no?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=why,K-kind of like you're about to do... b-but... um...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=crush,I'd ask someone else in Franchouchou... but is it true that having a small chest makes them more sensitive? <It would explain why Junko gets so... nervous sometimes!>
4-female_small_chest_is_visible=hum,They're so cute! To be honest, being kind of... busty can be a hassle. <Or a handful, depending on your outlook...>
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=ohno,<Of course they're damn cute! She's a hologram! Or an AI! Or something! How am I supposed to compete with that?!>

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=zettai,I'm a bit jealous! You're so put-together. N-not that you were built to be that way. Or that I was. I'm all my original parts. You're cute, ~name~, that's all!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=zettai,Don't be shy! Your freckles look adorable, Mahiru! Unless you meant your... size, I guess?

4-female_large_chest_is_visible=zettai,Don't worry, ~name~! Your idol's got the same build, so don't get discouraged!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddess don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? <So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i>>

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=huh,It could be worse, ~name~! You could have given away a big secret or something... oh. I see.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smile,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure you look wonderful!

-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=crush,If I get tired, can I rest my head on your chest? You look... really comfy, is all. <Plus, it would give you a great view.>
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:akko=hum,I'd love to do a tour with you on hand! You could really save us a lot of effort on Franchouchou's makeup, and I bet we'd provide great background music!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=why,T-though! S-she seems to lack your confidence in exposing her chest! A-at least besides in front of us!

-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=why,I... I mean, I wear panties! Is that weird? Am I not supposed to do that? B-but nobody wears nothing under their skirts... r-right?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena,targetSayingMarker:palutena_consequences=why,Have the ads been lying to me since puberty? If goddess don't wear bras, why did I spend so many yen on cute ones? <So... so many yen... <i>for bras nobody else even sees!</i>>

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=hum,That seems like... common sense, right?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=hum,<Pretty naughty, getting to see the illusive Kizuna Ai, naked...>
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=why,Huh? D-do girls do that? Give away their underwear? <I... if someone gave me their boxers as sleepwear. If we were dating... that's one thing, but what would you do with another girl's panties?>
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=smile,Um... if it makes you feel better, you're really... womanly!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=crush,P-promise you won't strike us blind? I know some spirits are known for that...

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=calm,F-from a certain point of view, I can see the appeal in being clean shaven... w-who wants to have a partner complain about getting hair in their mouth, r-right?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=smile,W-well, I think that "bare" look would ruin my image. It's better on sexy, forward types like ~name~. <I bet if Ai knew about this, she'd <i>totally</i> shave.>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=smile,If I knew I was going to be playing this tonight, I'd probably have cleaned up more than usual too.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=smile,That's like the perfect length! You still look really feminine, but like a woman... you know?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:akko=zettai,Even though you're out of clothes, you're at max cute, and I'm at max hype, Akko!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=huh,I'm... really seeing this, aren't I? W-well, I guess I should do <i>something</i> to make it up to you, Palutena... maybe a song...?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=rap,Obviously, you wouldn't wear panties under a leotard. That'd just be silly! It'd ride up and look really stupid. Not to mention, uncomfortable!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:5=why,Meia! Revy! Stop it! Franchouchou isn't about violence!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=huh,I-I guess if it makes you happy... I... I just... what? <What do I... do I need to watch over her?>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3=doubt,Sorry Twilight... I guess where you're from, this is normal... I'll... stop badgering you over it. <Even Tae listens! She's so weird! Very cute and nice! But so weird!!>

-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_matt1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:gwen_matt2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:gwen_matt2=huh,...this sounds very familiar. Does he do lots of sketchy quasi-legal things to advance his agenda?

-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero2=ohno,S-sorry, I just tend to think about this stuff.

-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2-5=doubt,Aimee, I can appreciate a good show but... this seems horribly violent.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2-5=doubt,An idol makes sure to uplife her fans and her audience... not kill them.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2-5=doubt,I know there's such a thing as "knocking them dead" but... could we not, Aimee?

-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_teas2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_teas3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_teas3=ohno,I kind of wonder how alcohol would affect me. Um, as an idol, obviously, I’d never drink before a show.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:nat_diet2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nat_diet3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:nat_diet3=happy,Hm… I’d be happy to sign some Franchouchou merchandise if you’d want! <<i>Plus, she’s not undead, so…</i>>

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

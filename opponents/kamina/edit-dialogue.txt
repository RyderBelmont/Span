#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=Shoes,shoes,extra,other,plural
clothes=Arm wraps,arm wraps,minor,upper,plural

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

male_removing_accessory=angry,If you want to impress me, you're gonna have to do a little better than <i>that</i>!
male_removing_accessory=shocked,What!? How did you hold onto that for so long? Did I hold back for too long!?
male_removing_accessory=angry,Seriously!? You won't be impressing anyone with your manliness with moves like that!
male_removing_accessory=thinking,So... you're going for a war of nutrition? attention? No, that ain't right. What was the phrase?
male_removing_accessory=cross,Seems like you're determined to drag this out... good thing I'm determined to win. Whose determination will win?
male_removed_accessory=cross,It ain't over. As long as I've got cards left in my hand, it ain't over.

female_removing_accessory=cross,Heh. Is that the best you can do? I didn't even notice you had that on!
female_removing_accessory=cross,If you want to impress me, you're gonna have to do something more exciting.
female_removing_accessory=cross,Is that the best you've got? Is there more coming? Or is this it?
female_removing_accessory=sad,Man... I knew it had to come off at some point, I was just hoping you'd take it off along with some other stuff...
female_removing_accessory=sad,And here I was hoping you'd forget about your ~clothing~...
female_removed_accessory=sad,That's it, huh? No chance this is a prank and you're gonna take off everything at once?
female_removed_accessory=sad,Damn, I got all excited for that? I guess there's always next round...
female_removed_accessory=sad,Is that it? Guess I better not lose, so I can get you out of more than that.
female_removed_accessory=cross,Well, I guess I can't just expect you to get to the good stuff when you've still got stuff like that...
female_removed_accessory=cross,I guess the battle's just getting started, ain't it? Better give it my all then...
female_removed_accessory=angry,Come on! You seriously think I'm just gonna sit there and accept that? Who the hell do you think I am!?
female_removed_accessory=point,Come on! If you wanna clash your soul against mine, you're gonna need to hit harder than that!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

male_removing_minor=sad,Well... I guess it ain't an accessory... Still pretty boring though...
male_removing_minor=sad,I wasn't the only one hoping for something more than just his ~clothing~, right?
male_removing_minor=sad,That's... not all you're taking off, right? You're just joking with us, right?
male_removing_minor=angry,Come on! Don't drag this out more than necessary! Grit your teeth, and tear it off!
male_removing_minor=angry,Pick up the pace! If you're going for something as small as your ~clothing~, then at least do it quickly!
male_removing_minor=point,If you think that's good enough to impress the Mighty Kamina, then I've got some bad news for you, pal!
male_removing_minor=point,Come on! You can do better than that, ~name~! I know you can! You know you can! Everyone knows you can!
male_removing_minor=point,Come on, ~name~, you know that I know that you know that you can do better than that!
male_removed_minor=sad,You know, ~name~, it ain't easy to come up with all these manly speeches, especially if you're gonna take of something as boring as your ~clothing~.
male_removed_minor=sad,It takes a lot to leave the Mighty Kamina with nothing to say... but how am I supposed to remark on something like that?
male_removed_minor=sad,Man... what am I even supposed to say about that? Even the Mighty Kamina is struggling to find out how to make that exciting...
male_removed_minor=angry,Ah, come on! Where's the passion!? The gusto!? The mighty, manly, undying spirit!?
male_removed_minor=angry,Is that seriously the best you've got!? Grit your teeth and try again, ~name~!
male_removed_minor=angry,I ain't gonna hold your hand or praise you for small shit like that, ~name~! I'll make a man out of you somehow!
male_removed_minor=angry,If you think I'm gonna let you win with moves like that, then you've got that wrong!
female_removing_minor=sad,This is a joke, right? There's more to it than just your ~clothing~, right?
female_removing_minor=sad,Eh... there's gonna be more, right? It ain't really gonna be just your ~clothing~, right?
female_removing_minor=sad,Aw, come on. I've lost a bit too much to be all hyped over something like that...
female_removing_minor=sad,So, uh, what are the odds your just taking off your ~clothing~ to get to something bigger?
female_removing_minor=sad,Man... is that really it? I was hoping for something a little more... I dunno... spicy? You get what I mean?
female_removing_minor=sad,Aw geez... That's... pretty boring. Come on, ~name~, you're gonna put me to sleep over here!
female_removed_minor=sad,Aw, well, don't sweat the petty stuff and don't pet the sweaty stuff, as they say.
female_removed_minor=cross,So... It's like that then? Guess I'll have to give it 110%... No! 169%! That's a much nicer number.
female_removed_minor=angry,Come on! You won't impress me with moves like that! Go beyond! Do something incredible! ~name~!
female_removed_minor=angry,Is that the best you've got!? Come on! Grit your teeth and do better! I believe in you, damnit!
female_removed_minor=cross,Heh... just cause you took off something that shows a little skin doesn't mean I'm gonna turn into a blushing mess.
female_removed_minor=point,If you wanna impress the Mighty Man Kamina, you're gonna have to try a little harder than <i>that!</i>
female_removed_minor=point,Come on! Is that really the best you've got! Go beyond! Show us a burning, passionate soul!
female_removed_minor=point,You're gonna need to go a little further than that to impress the mighty man Kamina!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

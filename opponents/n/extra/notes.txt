**FIELDNOTES**
- Here, we'll assume about 2 years has passed after BW2 occured. This may change depending on what Horsekiller does for Hilda. N is 22 here.

- He has no clue what's happening at first. Even after catching wind of what's going on, he'll stay out of curiousity, even when he needs to forfeit.

- He still hasn't given up on his goal to become a meditator between humans and Pokemon and adores Pokemon as much as ever. But he won't openly speak about it until asked.
- However, he will not mention his past as the former king of Team Plasma, although he may unintentionally drop hints about him being royalty. 

- I personally imagine him to be demisexual, so he won't show too much sexual attraction to the other players. He'll be intrigued when a major item is taken off, but only because it shows the progression of people stripping, not because of the skin being shown (I'll handle lines where the character removes a major item early, then removes something minor/extra). Instead of aroused, he'll likely be tense and awkward when nudity is shown because he's unsure how to react to it. Hilda is the only exception to the lack of sexual interest.

- He probably has never seen a naked girl, poor guy. He's obviously never seen one masturbating either, so he'll definetly be intrigued there.

- N isn't ENF, but he's not confident/nonchalant about nudity either. It's more or less something between the two--he doesn't mind being seen nude too much, but he's a bit sheepish about it, knowing being seen like this is socially unacceptable. He especially doesn't like removing his shirt because of his scars. He won't reveal the story behind them either.

- When something that has to do with math or science is brought up, he'll be excited and start to ramble about that topic. Same deal with Pokemon. He's a massive nerd.

- For his speech patterns, it'll be formal and polite without using big or overly-complicated words unless something catches his interest. When awkward of uncertain, he'll speak a bit more casually. The more awkward he feels, the more casual his vocabulary is. The more excited he gets, the more formal and verbose he becomes.

- N is fairly naive. Yes, he knows about sex, masturbation, nudity, etc. but he won't understand certain slang words and most social cues. He doesn't understand why some people react with anger if something small is removed either. If anyone tries to hit on him, he'll just react with confusion.

- He's very kind to most of the players. The sole exception is Moon. He despises her.

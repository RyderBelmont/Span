#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

-3-okay_hand,totalRounds:15-,priority:0=bored.png,Can we move on yet? I'm falling asleep.
-3-okay_hand,totalRounds:15-,priority:0=happy.png,Yes yes, the cards are very nice, now let's move on!
-3-bad_hand=sinister.png,Looks like the dealer's going to get <i>really</i> sick <i>really</i> soon!
-3-bad_hand=sinister.png,I'm upset! And when I'm upset, <i>the ground shakes</i>!
-3-bad_hand=sinister.png,One asystolic dealer, coming up!
-3-bad_hand=sinister.png,You can't spell "malpractice" without "practice." <i>Wink wink nudge nudge, dealer!</i>
-3-bad_hand=annoyed.png,Okay, Beatrix... <i>Sigh,</i> compose yourself.
-3-bad_hand=annoyed.png,I blame these cards entirely on you, ~player~!
-3-bad_hand=hopkins.png,Damn this hand!... Oh, not <i>you</i>, Professor. You did nothing wrong.
-3-bad_hand=happy.png,Oopsie! I think I forgot to exchange my cards!... <i>What do you mean I already did?!</i>
-3-bad_hand=smug.png,Are these cards a joke? They <i>must</i> be a joke, right?
-3-bad_hand,totalExposed:1,totalNaked:1,priority:0=oops.png,Let's be honest here: the dealer has just as much control over our cards as we do. That doesn't stop me from wanting to turn him into a pin cushion, though!
-3-bad_hand,totalFinished:1-=oops.png,Looks like this is it for me. It was fun while it lasted.
-3-bad_hand,totalFinished:1-=oops.png,Looks like I'm going to lose. Oh well, winning would've been nice, but I'm not against putting on a little show.

-3-hand,count-role;other&character;joey&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=telling.png,<i>You're eating it?</i> That's absolutely disgusting! The peel doesn't protect it from anything like you might think!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;saki&stage;1:=smug.png,Do you get what I'm saying, kitten? This game alone won't solve your problems. You're going to need to put in more work than that!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;amalia&stage;5&timeinstage;0:=laugh.png,Flowers? <i>Flowers? That's</i> your saving grace? Ah hahaha ha ha!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;1:=grin.png,I'm just going to pretend I <i>didn't</i> hear you take the name of the Silent Sisters in vain.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;sei&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;drinks_anyone:=happy.png,None for me! Alcohol doesn't affect my system properly, so I'd get all the cons with none of the pros.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=telling.png,Of course I do. If you <i>must</i> know, my mother is a very prominent Silent Sister, without whom I wouldn't be alive today - for more reasons than one.
-3-hand,oneShotId:2,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;beatrix_robot:,id:41,marker:ErufudaRobots=informative.png,Technically speaking, yes, robots <i>can</i> gain weight, but if you're trying to ask if <i>I</i> can gain weight because you think I'm a robot, yes, I can as well. That's why I watch what I eat.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;2&timeinstage;0:=oops.png,That was sarcasm, by the way. I knew from the start - and no, not because I can detect gender on sight. It was because of how hard you were trying to be convincing.
-3-hand,oneShotId:4,count-role;other&character;erufuda&saidmarker;beatrix_clothes_fit:,id:40,marker:ErufudaPants=smug.png,The fact that you said "<i>maybe</i> they fit too well" tells me that they don't. Besides, if they fit you well, they wouldn't rip. Deande's leggings have never ripped, and they hug her form like a second skin.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;jessie&saying;syringes:=hopkins.png,This "syringe" is the “Incistyx” Javelin-class Injector, and it's capable of delivering ampoules through Thrall derma from up to 200 meters away. Impressive, I know.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;akko&stage;1&timeinstage;0:=informative.png,You know, you're not the first Varimorph I've met who thinks what they do is magic. You wouldn't happen to be related to and/or affiliated with Orendi, would you?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;jura&stage;6-8:,count-role;self&saidmarker;JuraEgg1&notsaidmarker;JuraEgg2:,id:38,marker:JuraEgg2=telling.png,I have other tools, you know! A doctor of my caliber requires many tools. Only a baffoon would attempt to use nothing but the same tool for every job!
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;saki_zls&stage;7&timeinstage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;RottingFleshCare:,id:12,marker:RottingFleshCare=informative.png,Listen, if you're going to insist on hiding your rotting flesh, then you need to at least take enough care of it so that it's not <i>rotting</i> flesh. Luckily, I know some things about corpse preservation that I can teach you.
-3-hand,count-role;self&losses;2:,count-role;other&character;pinkie_pie&stage;3-5&sayingmarker;dizzy_pre_pinka2:=informative.png,Nothing to worry about. Just relax, lie on your back, and apply immediate pressure to your temples.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;jura&stage;6:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;JuraEgg1:,marker:JuraEgg1=informative.png,Say whatever you like, but the fact of the matter is that egg-splicing is an artificial birth process, and to my experience, such doesn't always go so well.

-3-hand,priority:140,count-role;other&character;aella&stage;5:=informative.png,For one thing, they help reduce breast motion, which in turn reduces pain from excessive motion <i>and</i> reduces eventual sagging when you grow old.
-3-hand,priority:142,count-role;other&character;croix&stage;0-1&saidmarker;nefarious&sayingmarker;cube_explanation:=smug.png,Emotional <i>energy</i>? What kind of nonsense are you talking about? I mean, sure, emotions can change a person's body temperature, but that's hardly energy!
-3-hand,priority:155,count-role;other&character;joey&stage;4&timeinstage;1:=telling.png,Just because you have an active immune system doesn't mean you should go around doing disgusting things and risk getting sick. You wouldn't lick a toilet seat, would you?
-3-hand,priority:155,count-role;other&character;cammy_white&stage;1&timeinstage;0:,id:31=oops.png,Take them off if you want. It's your ass this'll come back to bite, not mine.

-3-hand,priority:156,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;1&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;honorable_others:=smug.png,Ha! Wouldn't you like to know what I'm into.
-3-hand,priority:156,count-role;other&character;juri&stage;4&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;juri_attack:,id:25=informative.png,I was going to be mad at you for your failed attack, Juri, but now I'm interested in your... <i>hair trigger</i>. I've <i>got</i> to study you!
-3-hand,oneShotId:1,priority:242,count-role;other&character;mulan&stage;8&saidmarker;duel_lost:=happy.png,Tell me, have you ever considered having sex with something that's not humanoid? You know, like a dog, or a Varelsi.
-3-hand,totalAlive:2,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,marker:1v1=smug.png,And then there was one.
-3-hand,totalAlive:2,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,marker:1v1=smug.png,It's just you and me now. Scared? You should be.
-3-hand,totalAlive:2,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;1v1:,marker:1v1=happy.png,It's just us now. Good luck! You're going to need it!
-3-hand,totalRounds:1,count-role;other&character;spooky&stage;0-1:=hopkins.png,It's for injections, obviously! Precision injections from up to 200 meters away, at that!
-3-hand,totalRounds:28,totalExposed:1,totalNaked:1,priority:12=grin.png,I'm getting impatient. If this game doesn't end soon, I'm going to cut everyone's clothes off!
-3-hand,totalRounds:28=happy.png,Goodness, this game is certainly taking a long time.

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;0-7:=informative.png,Ahaha. Listen, honey, I know a thing or two about psychology. You're <i>clearly</i> trying to make me feel bad about myself so <i>you</i> can feel good about <i>your</i>self.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;0-7:=informative.png,Ahaha. Listen, honey, I know a thing or two about psychology. It's obvious that you just want to watch me lose my composure because it makes you feel in control.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;jura&stage;0-6:=informative.png,Believe it or not, science has actually proven that pink is the most attractive skin color, right above green and white -- ivory white, that is, not caucasian.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;aella:=oops.png,Clearly, this Etsuko of yours is a woman of good tastes. Too bad I won't be in this dress any longer.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:=hopkins.png,It's only a weapon if you consider needles weapons.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;misato&stage;0-4:=hopkins.png,It's the “Incistyx” Javelin-class Injector, designed to be capable of delivering ampoules through Thrall derma from up to 200 meters away. Impressed? You should be!
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;0-4:=informative.png,Likewise. It's always nice to be amongst people of similar intellect.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;0-6:=informative.png,No, of course not! I suck them with my <i>lips</i>!
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;0-6:=informative.png,Don't be ridiculous! What sort of loon performs oral with her <i>teeth</i>? I use my <i>lips</i>!
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;larachel:=hopkins.png,No, Rapier-class Injectors are a whole different beast. This is the “Incistyx” <i>Javelin</i>-class Injector, and it's far superior!
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;rin&stage;0-6:=oops.png,Oh, nothing too fancy, just a basic nerve-linked synthetic limb system with a ceramic casing.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;navi:=telling.png,That's not even remotely true. My close-range abilities can be just as deadly as my ranged ones!
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;navi:=informative.png,That's where you're wrong, Firefly. I'm just as lethal at close-range as I am at a distance.

0-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;winning1:=stripping.png,Funny, this isn't the first time I thought I would never lose a hand.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;orendi&stage;1-4:=strippingJ.png,Ha! "No pussyfooting," <i>says the one who still hasn't taken anything important off.</i> That's a good one, Orendi.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;orendi&stage;1-4:=stripping.png,Ha! That's pretty funny, Orendi. If I had any faith in your intelligence, I'd say you were being hypocritical on purpose!

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;orendi:=stripping.png,Only the dose makes the poison. The "goop" is not directly toxic. I would highly advise against agitating it, however.

0-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;Annoyed1:=stripping.png,See? You're supposed to <i>evoke</i> the release of endorphins, not inhibite it!

1-stripped=oops.png,It's not like I was expecting to keep my dress on the whole game.
1-stripped=oops.png,If I were afraid of taking off my clothes, I wouldn't be here.
1-stripped=oops.png,Nothing to be ashamed of. It's just my body and my underwear, and I chose both of them.
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;winning1:=hopkins.png,<i>Isn't that right, Professor?</i>
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;nami:=oops.png,<i>Ooh, sorry, I'm fresh out of salt tablets.</i>
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;joey:=stripped.png,<i>What's that? I can't hear you! You really shouldn't mumble!</i>
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;kyu&stage;0-6:=hopkins.png,Allow me to finish that thought for you: the giant needle hand is a very important and useful tool, and I love him very much!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;larachel:=oops.png,And that's why I play an Animancer instead.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;rin&stage;0-6:=cute.png,Aw, that's cute. You make paintings with your feet and write insults with your ass.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;orendi&stage;1-4:=smug.png,Count yourself lucky I'm playing with you at all.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;orendi&stage;1-4:=smug.png,<i>Gee, I wonder why I didn't.</i>
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;Angry1:=grin.png,Don't worry, if you couldn't get <i>that</i> through your thick head, my injector certainly will!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;sei:=hopkins.png,I could <i>never</i> remove Hopkins during a game of strip poker! It'd be far too painful!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=hopkins.png,It would be ethically reprehensible to remove the Incistyx! You don't want Professor Hopkin's poor little harresburra brain to die, do you?
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;Annoyed1:=informative.png,Notice how I didn't spontaneously combust. Now <i>you</i> try!
1-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;Annoyed1:=informative.png,I'd like to see the rest of you follow this example.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;twilight:=telling.png,Of course I am! Being "prepared for this game" doesn't mean piling on dozens of accessories!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jura&stage;0-6:=oops.png,Oh well. If you don't want a check-up from one of the brightest minds on all of Tempest, that's your loss.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;akko:=telling.png,Okay, A: There's no such thing as magic. B: I don't work with fungus, and C: even if I <i>did</i>, that doesn't automatically mean I'm the same as someone else who does!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;elizabeth&stage;0-8:=oops.png,Sorry, Elizabeth, but the place I bought my dress at was swallowed by the Varelsi's veil. They're gone now.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;ribbon_girl:=happy.png,Thank you, Ribbon Girl. At least <i>someone</i> around here agrees with how I play this game!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;aella:=oops.png,Why would I wear more than that? So I can pad out how many times I can lose like some kind of coward?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;clover:=smug.png,Yeah, that's not a saying that anyone has ever used.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;orendi:=happy.png,You do that, Orendi. I'll be here when you figure it out.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=grin.png,You need to get your eyes checked. I'm <i>very</i> competent at what I do - including mercy-killings.
1-stripped,count-dominant&role;other:=grin.png,I make nature my bitch on a daily basis. I'll make you one too if I feel like it, so don't tempt me.
1-stripped,count-dominant&role;other:=grin.png,But if you really think you can dominate someone who can make you wake up with your stomach in your feet, be my guest.
1-stripped,count-dominant&role;other:=grin.png,But if you really want to challenge someone with a javelin-sized needle for an arm and intimate knowledge of vital organs and arteries, be my guest.
1-stripped,test:~background~:=happy.png,There. Now my clothes will at least be moderately clean.
1-stripped,test:~background~:beach=informative.png,Thankfully, the materials my dress is made out of don't retain sand well, so I won't need to clean it later.
1-must_strip,marker:normal1=smug.png,Look, I could say something clever, or I can just strip. I think I know which you'd prefer.
1-must_strip=happy.png,Take a guess at what comes next. Go ahead, I'll wait.
1-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,marker:MultipleLosses=annoyed.png,<i>Me again?</i> Fine!
1-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,marker:MultipleLosses=annoyed.png,<i>How is it even possible that I'm the one losing?! I'm the smartest, most cunning person here!</i>
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;starfire:=smug.png,<i>Surrender?</i> Do you even know who I am?
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;larachel:=oops.png,It's only as lethal as any other injector. The fact that it's large and acting as an arm doesn't change that.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;0-4:=hopkins.png,Several things, actually. Sedatives, stimulatives, and a few different live viruses - for experiments, obviously.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;croix&stage;2-6:=oops.png,Sorry, I just don't believe the numbers of someone who thinks magic is real. It's nothing personal, I don't believe Orendi, Boldur, or <i>any</i> of those silly Eldrids, either.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5-8:=oops.png,To think there was once a point where people thought I wouldn't live past 16.
1-must_strip,timeInStage:7-,saidMarker:winning1=happy.png,Wow, either I'm really good at poker, or you all suck at it! Let's go with <i>both</i>.

1-must_strip_winning=oops.png,Winning is fun, blah blah blah. Does it really matter what I say now? You're about to see my breasts.
1-must_strip_normal,marker:normal1=smug.png,Look, I could say something clever, or I can just strip. I think I know which you'd prefer.
1-must_strip_normal=happy.png,Take a guess at what comes next. Go ahead, I'll wait.

1-stripping=stripping.png,Get ready to see the most arousing small bust you've ever seen!
1-stripping=stripping.png,I hope you like small breasts, because mine will be the best ones you've ever seen!
1-stripping=stripping.png,If you don't like small breasts <i>now</i>, don't worry, I can perform corrective surgery on you later.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:amalia=stripping.png,I can see why you'd draw those comparisons, but A: I didn't build the Incistyx, and B: I'm actively trying to <i>save</i> planets from their destruction.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping.png,You sure are asking a lot of questions for a man who's about to see an <i>amazing</i> pair of breasts.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;larachel:=stripping.png,<i>Oh, I'm sorry, I think I left all my accessories somewhere elbow-deep inside my last experiment.</i>
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;orendi:=stripping.png,As I'm sure everyone does.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=stripping.png,Depends on your definition of a "weapon." Can I kill you with it? Yes. Can I kill you with literally any other kind of injector? Also yes.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;0-4:=stripping.png,Don't worry, there's nothing in there that I can't undo.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripping.png,Get ready to see the most arousing small bust you've ever seen!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;starfire:=stripping.png,I hope you like small breasts, because mine will be the best ones you've ever seen!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;chazz:=stripping.png,I'm willing to bet if I were any more like this "Nurse Fontaine," I wouldn't be playing this game with you in the first place.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;akko:=stripping.png,It's not as hard as you think. All it takes is a few scalpels and some red stemcell fluid. If you want to go the biological route, anyway.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;croix&stage;2-6:=stripping.png,Oh yes, I'm sure your <i>nanotech</i> - not magic - is reading me just fine with a result like that. Totally not broken, I'm sure.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5-8:=stripping.png,Simple: Sustainment. A process that consumes massive amounts of the universe's energy, and thus is only done for select few people.
1-stripping,saidMarker:Annoyed2=stripping.png,I can't say you've earned it, but hopefully this will incentivise you to be more... <i>entertaining</i>.
1-stripping,saidMarker:MultipleLosses=stripping.png,Since you wanted to see them so badly, here they come!
1-stripping,saidMarker:normal1=stripping.png,Obviously you'd rather I say something clever. Why else would you even be listening to me right now?
1-stripping,saidMarker:normal1=stripping.png,Your mouth is intensely focused on my mouth, ~player~, so you're <i>clearly</i> hoping I'd say something clever.


#losing panties
2-stripped=stripped.png,Try not to strain your eyes staring. I'm not an Ophthalmologist, so I won't be able to help you.
2-stripped=stripped.png,<i>They're perfect, I know.</i>
2-stripped=stripped.png,Pretty perky for a 71-year-old, wouldn't you agree?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia=oops.png,Nope. I don't have time for egg-chasing.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:clover=stripped.png,Admit it, Clover, you're jealous. Everyone knows that smaller breasts are more sensitive.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped.png,Why don't you come touch them and see what sort of response it elicits?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped.png,Clearly, you don't know as much about breasts as I do. These puppies are <i>flawless</i>.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;orendi:=stripped.png,At least one of you full appreciates my bust.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;croix&stage;2-6:=stripped.png,Huh, I guess a stopped clock <i>is</i> right twice a day. They <i>are</i> nice breasts. Thank you for noticing.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=smug.png,Is that dread I hear, or excitement?
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;starfire:=stripped.png,See? What did I tell you? They're perfect.
2-stripped,count-role;self&saidmarker;MultipleLosses:,marker:MultipleLosses=0=stripped.png,There! Happy? You'd better be!
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;chazz:=happy.png,There's a term I'd like to introduce you to, Chazz. That term is "Racist," and it's a bad thing to be. It's when you judge people for their skin tones.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripped.png,Try not to strain your eyes staring. I'm not an Ophthalmologist, so I won't be able to help you.
2-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=oops.png,Your loss, because the Incistyx isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

2-stripped,priority:0,count-male:2-4=stripped.png,Careful how much you stare, boys. It is <i>very much</i> possible to die from an erection.
2-stripped,priority:0,count-male:2-4=stripped.png,Careful how much you stare, boys. Wouldn't want <i>now</i> to be the time you find out that you have Volatile Erection Syndrome.
2-stripped,count-uses_camera&role;other:=stripped.png,Take all the pictures you like. I don't mind. Really.
2-stripped,count-uses_camera&role;other:=stripped.png,Take all the pictures you like. I don't mind. I'm sure they're quite photogenic.
2-stripped,count-uses_camera&role;other:=stripped.png,Take a picture, it'll last longer.
2-stripped,saidMarker:Annoyed2=stripped.png,Feeling incentivised yet?
2-stripped,saidMarker:normal1=stripped.png,Too bad for you, I opted to strip instead. Better luck next time!
2-stripped,saidMarker:normal1=stripped.png,Sure, words can induce arousal, but exposing your genitals is a far more effective method.
2-must_strip=telling.png,Ugh, this better be the last hand I lose. I do still want to win, you know!
2-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,marker:MultipleLosses=annoyed.png,<i>Me again?</i> Fine!

2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;larachel:=telling.png,Don't count your chickens before they hatch, princess. I'm not out yet!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;starfire:=informative.png,I assure you, it's very standard, very healthy, and very clean!
2-must_strip,count-role;other&character;larachel&stage;7-8:=smug.png,You say that as if you're going to beat me, yet you're already out.
2-must_strip,totalExposed:1,totalNaked:0,marker:FirstOneNude=sinister.png,<i>Are you serious?</i> I'm the first one who has to get naked?
2-must_strip,totalExposed:1,totalNaked:0,marker:FirstOneNude=sinister.png,Enjoy this while you can, ~player~! Life can be shorter than you think!
2-must_strip,totalExposed:3-,totalNaked:2-=oops.png,Oh well. Naked doesn't mean defeated.
2-must_strip,totalExposed:3-,totalNaked:2-=oops.png,No big deal. I worked too hard on this body to not show it off - and I don't mean exercising.
2-must_strip_winning=oops.png,Oh well. I tried my best.
2-must_strip_normal=oops.png,Oh well. Naked doesn't mean defeated.
2-must_strip_normal=oops.png,No big deal. I worked too hard on this body to not show it off - and I don't mean exercising.
2-must_strip_losing=oops.png,Oh well. Naked doesn't mean defeated.
2-must_strip_losing=oops.png,No big deal. I worked too hard on this body to not show it off - and I don't mean exercising.
2-stripping=stripping.png,Ugh, I really should've worn side-tie panties today...
2-stripping=stripping.png,I don't need any help. I can get them myself.
2-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;FirstOneNude:=stripping.png,<i>Yes yes, it's very amusing watching the one-armed girl remove her panties.</i>
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;ini&stage;5-8:=stripping.png,If I didn't want to be purple, I can change that <i>myself</i>.
2-stripping,count-role;self&saidmarker;MultipleLosses:=stripping.png,This is why I don't coast by off of my looks! Showing your breasts is never enough for some people!
2-stripping,count-role;other&character;larachel:=stripping.png,Ugh, you have to bring that up during the most difficult part of my undressing...

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING

#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton,marker:-=oops.png,Honestly, the fact that you're a robot turns me off more than your unconventional anatomy.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton,marker:-=oops.png,It's such a shame you're a robot. You'd be much more fun if you were organic.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,marker:-=happy.png,It's always good to let your breasts hang free every now and again!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,marker:-=happy.png,Let's inspect "the goods," shall we?

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6,marker:-=telling.png,Finally! For someone who started off by removing her underwear, you sure took a long time to show off your breasts!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska,marker:-=happy.png,Looks like these outfits are getting smaller and smaller. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you planned this!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:vriska,marker:-=oops.png,Looks like these outfits are getting smaller and smaller. It's almost like your outfit-swapping device has a mind of its own.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kizuna:=sad.png,Damn. I wasn't kidding when I said I hoped you're a hermaphrodite, by the way. They really <i>are</i> more fun!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:,marker:-=telling.png,Going without panties is unhygienic, unhealthy, and, and... <i>damn it</i>, fine, it's sexy too.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:,marker:-=smug.png,Sure, going without panties is a great idea - <i>if you like vaginal rashes.</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=informative.png,Hmm... I do believe there is, but it would make the sucking unpleasant for both parties involved, so "your friend" might not want it.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:,marker:-=oops.png,Honestly, if you're so averse to nudity, why are you even here?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:,marker:-=oops.png,Huh. No imperfections. Artificially birthed lifeforms don't usually turn out so... orderly.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:,marker:-=oops.png,Okay, I must admit: you certainly are the most attractive artificially birthed life form I've ever seen.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;orendi:=happy.png,If by "dreams" you mean "nightmares," sure.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,marker:-=informative.png,Fun fact: using shampoo and conditioner on your pubic hair is a quite healthy thing to do, and I encourage <i>everyone</i> to do so!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,marker:-=informative.png,Contrary to what is popular, growing out your pubic hair is extraordinarily good for your health, as it prevents infections!

2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,marker:-=happy.png,Shaving your pubic hair increases your likelihood for a pubic infection, but to hell with that! You look great!

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia,marker:-=smug.png,Is being bottomless really a worthwhile trade-off for that fake-out?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon,marker:-=shocked.png,Oh dear! That is absolutely disturbing - and trust me, I know disturbing!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon,marker:-=shocked.png,Oh dear! That is the most disgusting vagina I've ever seen!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon,marker:-=smug.png,There's a lot I can fix with my medical expertise, but <i>that</i> is <i>beyond</i> repair.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon,marker:-=smug.png,Congratulations, Moon. You've disgusted me. <i>Me. Disgusted.</i> That's not easy to do, you know!

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1,marker:-=oops.png,Heck, why not just cut to the chase entirely and strip nude right now?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:-=oops.png,At this point your choices don't surprise me anymore.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:8a,marker:-=oops.png,That's not <i>technically</i> nude, but close enough!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:8b,marker:-=oops.png,Well, that's <i>technically</i> nude, even if your body is obscured by a towel.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStatus:naked,priority:0=happy.png,<i>Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure you can still win this despite being naked. You're totally not screwed right now!</i>

-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton,marker:-=oops.png,It's such a shame you're a robot. You'd be much more fun if you were organic.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,marker:-=informative.png,Anyone who says small breasts are inferior is both scientifically inaccurate and a buffoon!

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=oops.png,I'm being sarcastic, of course. As long as you strip and masturbate, I don't give a damn who you are.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:,marker:-=telling.png,Not only is that factually inaccurate, but it's a dumb belief! A warrior like yourself needs a bra more than anyone!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:,marker:-=smug.png,Sure, going without panties is a great idea - <i>if you like vaginal rashes.</i>

-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=oops.png,I'm being sarcastic, of course. As long as you strip and masturbate, I don't give a damn who you are.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:,marker:-=telling.png,Not only is that factually inaccurate, but it's a dumb belief! A warrior like yourself needs a bra more than anyone!

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,marker:-=informative.png,Remember: bigger doesn't always mean better!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=telling.png,Large breasts are only superficially attractive due to an outdated instinctual assumption that large-breasted women are better caregivers!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

-3-male_finished_masturbating=happy.png,Good start, but I'll need a larger sample size for conclusive data!

-3-male_finished_masturbating=telling.png,Hey! You wasted a perfectly good sperm sample! I want that in a cup next time!

-3-male_finished_masturbating=informative.png,Fun fact: it is very much possible to become so used to orgasming that they're no longer pleasant.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=informative.png,Be sure to keep at least 24 hours between your orgasms. The longer you go without an orgasm, the better they feel!

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=Dress,dress,major,upper
clothes=Top,top,important,upper

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Oh good, you came back! I guess we <i>won't</i> be needing sedatives!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:fled=happy,Oh good, subject - I mean <i>Florina</i> - has returned!

1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=happy,Oh, don't worry. I don't kink shame. If you like dressing up as a ladybug when you dominate people, I won't judge.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, you were just changing clothes. Am I supposed to be impressed? I built a clothes-changing device like that when I was <i>twelve.</i>

1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=happy,Ooh, rustic. Not bad.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=informative,If you like, I can replace those legs of yours! Feet are not necessary when you have a good pair of legs!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=informative,If you like, I can replace those legs of yours! Give you a nice, feet-free pair like mine!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=smug,Nice outfit. Did it come with a free frisbee?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=annoyed,... You're kidding, right?

1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=happy,So you're a maid now, huh? Great! My quarters need dusting. Hop to it!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=happy,Hope that outfit didn't give you scurvy; I'm all out of vitamine C supplements.

2-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy,Hey, they may be small, but they still function!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=informative,Science has proven that small breasts are both more healthy than large breasts <i>and</i> more arousing!

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=informative,Fun fact: 80% of all women wear the wrong size bra. That could very well be the source of your discomfort, Twilight.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=happy,Oh good, one less item to stall with!

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=telling,Not only is that factually inaccurate, but it's a dumb belief! A warrior like yourself needs a bra more than anyone!

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,I'd say that I'll take off my own panties as a show of support, but... Yeah, that's not going to happen.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Oh my. Your heart rate, your breathing, your obviously sexual moaning; everything points to one thing; <i>you're about to climax!</i>
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=happy,I just <i>love</i> watching flowers wilt.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, why not?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=annoyed,Can't you take off that gross, sweaty bra first?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=annoyed,You're really going to leave that disgusting, dirty bra on longer?

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Is that confidence I hear?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Someone sure sounds confident.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:8a=oops,That's not <i>technically</i> nude, but close enough!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shy=informative,Uh, let me clarify: while <i>they're</i> in the nude, not me! <i>Why, that would be unprofessional!</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=oops,Huh. No imperfections. Artificially birthed lifeforms don't usually turn out so... orderly.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=oops,Okay, I must admit: you certainly are the most attractive artificially birthed lifeform I've ever seen.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=annoyed,Ugh, I still can't believe you wore your dirty laundry to this strip poker match!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:joey=oops,Bra, panties, either way, you're losing, and that makes me happy.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=oops,Looks like you're done to me.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=oops,Well, I'd be lying if I said I haven't gotten off to dangerous situations too.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=telling,Going without panties is unhygienic, unhealthy, and, and... <i>damn it</i>, fine, it's sexy too.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=smug,Sure, going without panties is a great idea - <i>if you like vaginal rashes.</i>

2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=informative,Contrary to what is popular, growing out your pubic hair is extraordinarily good for your health, as it prevents infections!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,Looks like <i>someone's</i> prepped for surgery!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,Shaving your pubic hair increases your likelihood for a pubic infection, but to hell with that! You look great!

-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=telling,If you don't think small breasts are superior, you are mentally ill and should seek professional help!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=informative,Fun fact: breasts are one thing that surgery <i>can't</i> make better and will in fact make them look <i>worse</i> upon augmentation.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.

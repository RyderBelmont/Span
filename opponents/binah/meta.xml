    <description>Binah is the Patron Librarian of the Floor of Philosophy in the Library, formerly the Sephirah of Lobotomy Corporation's Extraction Team and a former Arbiter. Binah is a wise, dignified, and mysterious person. Although she possesses an immense amount of knowledge about The City and its denizens as a former Arbiter, she often speaks in verbose metaphors and similes, rarely ever giving a straight answer. Her old sadism seems to have mellowed out, having accepted that she's no longer the same person she was as an Arbiter, and although she still finds some enjoyment in inflicting fear in her peers, she is much more friendly. She enjoys tea and literature, and sometimes refers to those she cares for as "her children".</description>

#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=gloves,gloves,extra,other,plural

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character

0-selected=interested,Operator 6O told me this was a chance to study behaviors that might help my missions with 2B. I’m looking forward to seeing how you all react to the stress of this situation.
0-game_start=confident,I’m YorHa Scanner unit, designation 9S. I know this card game is pretty simple, but I hope you’ll all give me a good challenge.
0-game_start=calm,9S here, and ready to observe and analyze this “Inventory” location. If you’d like, you can call me “Nines.”
0-game_start=clever,Huh, a simulation of an Old World card game? Is this the program you said would help me “blow off some pressure”, 21O?
0-game_start,alsoPlaying:sayaka=custom:Pod,I prefer the term "android," but no, I don't have a winding key. I <i>do</i> have a powerful nuclear reactor inside of me, though...
0-game_start,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,priority:400=interested,Oh! I haven't seen a human with... <i>that</i> would explain a lot! You're an android too, huh, Shimakaze? Do you have a designation, or just a name?
0-game_start,alsoPlaying:kizuna,count-futaba:0=happy,An AI? Huh. Not what I was expecting, but she seems... a little clueless.
0-game_start,totalMales:4,count-human_female:1=happy,~Player~ is set to female...? I see you're really interested in playing with all men.
0-game_start,totalMales:5=happy,Hm. All boys tonight? At least we'll all be familiar with the anatomy.
0-game_start,totalMales:5=happy,I see it's all men in this simulation. That's fine, I'm sure you'll all have a lot to teach me.
0-game_start,totalMales:5=happy,Interesting, no female models... I guess I'll learn a lot about male anatomy today.




#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=calm,~cards~, dealer.
swap_cards=calm,Okay, let’s try ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm,I only need ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm,I need ~cards~ cards to compile this.

0-good_hand=excited,Performing even better than expected. The rest of you don’t stand a chance.
0-good_hand=clever,You know, maybe I should’ve done a combat simulation. I’m one of the best Scanner types in battle, and it’d be more fair to the rest of you.
0-okay_hand=interested,This seems safe. <i>Pod</i>, make sure you’re capturing this.
0-okay_hand=calm,What’d everyone else get? This hand seems okay.
0-okay_hand=happy,My diagnostics say that lots of people used to wager all kinds of stakes on this. Clothes, money, favors…
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:d.va_wager_set,notSaidMarker:9s_d.va_wager_accept,marker:9s_d.va_wager_accept=calm,A wager, huh? Interesting. I'll take you up on that.
0-okay_hand,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,timeInStage:1-3,notSaidMarker:hi_liz,marker:hi_liz=happy,Oh, no, Elizabeth, I'm not blind. I can probably see better than you, actually. This visor gives me all sorts of encounter data. Like your rising pulse rate!
0-bad_hand=frustrated,Wait, this can’t be right, there’s no way I get this kind of draw this quickly when I traded that many cards last round already.
0-bad_hand=calm,This seems… A little less user friendly than I expected.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:0=interested,Of course I am! My internal program has undergone 250 complete solar iterations.

0-hand,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:futaba_juke_ask,notSaidMarker:futaba_juke_ask,marker:futaba_juke_ask=confident,Hm. I like ambient recordings from Earth. Though I don't understand what Dark Ambient is except that it's soothing.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0,totalRounds:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> Scan Marinette. Sure she's not <i>just</i> wearing three pieces to this? Well, four if she takes the earrings off step by step.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:monika,alsoPlayingStage:2,priority:990,marker:monika_challenge=happy,Okay, Monika dot chr, you're an AI of some sort, but do you want to push your luck against a YorHa scanner model...?
0-hand,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:honorable_others,notSaidMarker:9s_others,marker:9s_others=interested,Huh. I figured this was a less romantic game than that. Well, in a partner, Mulan? I prefer models that match my strengths and weaknesses, like 2B or 21O. Did I misunderstand?
0-hand,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_goron,notSaidMarker:9s_goron,marker:9s_goron=interested,What's a Goron? Are they also constructed?
0-hand,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:nines,notSaidMarker:hinayru,marker:hinayru=clever,Nine, like the number, S, like the symbol, Nayru... I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to be, you're definitely not human!
0-hand,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pit_favfood,notSaidMarker:9s_favfoods,marker:9s_favfoods=frustrated,Favorite foods, Pit? Hmm… I don't really eat, but I hear Mackerel is a forbidden delicacy.

0-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:drinks_anyone,notSaidMarker:9s_drinks,marker:9s_drinks=interested,I uh, don’t think I can actually consume alcohol, Sei. Though, in the spirit of fairness, if they keep any E-Drugs for androids, I could give it a try. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sei_anal,notSaidMarker:9s_seinal,marker:9s_seinal=interested,I understand that region is primarily used for shunting waste in humans… but doesn’t it have a lot of nerve sensitivity? I suppose it’s worth a shot with proper precautions.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:introduction,saidMarker:pod_135,notSaidMarker:rensouhou,priority:400,marker:rensouhou=interested,Huh! Pod-153 runs a condensed energy program as well, Shimakaze. So uh, yeah, he's also a gun.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:introduction,saidMarker:pod_135,notSaidMarker:rensouhou,priority:400,marker:rensouhou=clever,Are you talking about aquatic machines? Abyssal is certainly a colorful name for them. And Pod-153 and Rensouhou-chan should certainly exchange data from the audience!
0-hand,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,notSaidMarker:2corrins,count-corrin_f:1,marker:2corrins=frustrated,Whoa, wait a second, are you Corrins two YorHa models? You even have the same name! Your eyes are red, are you suffering from a logic virus...?
0-hand,alsoPlaying:mavis,alsoPlayingStage:2-8,notSaidMarker:vampires,count-remilia:1,marker:vampires=clever,So... are Mavis and Remilia... both... cannibals of some sort? I've met some machines that devour others...
0-hand,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly>=1,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly1,marker:temporal_anamoly1=custom:Pod,I guess we found one source of the chronal distortion... I wonder if there's more?
0-hand,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly>=2,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly2,marker:temporal_anamoly2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, should we abort this simulation? It seems like two of them are manipulating time... This'll be quite a challenge to build anything resembling a good predictive model.
0-hand,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly>=3,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly3,marker:temporal_anamoly3=happy,~Player~, are you just hunting for easter eggs? Well, good choice!
0-hand,timeInStage:0,priority:150,marker:pod_135=custom:Pod,I’ll be issuing periodic commands to Pod-153, my personal tactical support unit. You uh, do have these here, right?
0-hand,timeInStage:0,priority:150,marker:pod_135=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>-- Oh wait, right. My support unit is here in the audience helping me record encounter data. Don’t worry, this is all in service to the YorHa project, for the Glory of Mankind.
0-hand,timeInStage:0,priority:150,marker:pod_135=custom:Pod,So, what designations do you use for your Pods? You know, your support units for this simulation? Mine’s 153, and it’ll be helping me analyze data during the game.

1-good_hand=confident,The gloves are off, so you all should expect me to play more hands like this.
1-okay_hand=calm,Gloves or no, I think I’ve got a solid grip on my competition.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,No need to use hacks here. I'll disable my tactical network... And well, yeah, Palutena, it's not like I <i>really</i> expect to lose.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=confident,I hope it'll be interesting, Pit! Show me what you're made of!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=confident,...Anyway, Rinkah, my visor doesn't obscure my sight. It even has neat features like heat or moisture tracking. It's uh, fairly enlightening in this situation.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripped,Save <i>me</i>? Well... you do move like a YorHa unit. Maybe you'll succeed.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_2b2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_2b3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_2b3=stripped,Subtlety goes a long way, Streaming-chan.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_bondage2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_bondage3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_bondage3=stripped,I-- <i>wow</i>. Humans are into some rather interesting sensory experiences.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_companions2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_companions3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_companions3=stripped,They're certainly attractive!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_fight2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_fight3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_fight3=stripped,I tend to prefer the offense, myself, but I’m happy to be impressive!

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_natsuki2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_natsuki3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_natsuki3=stripped,..Natsuki’s kind of got a similar personality too. I’m sure she’ll warm up later.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_nines2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_nines3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_nines3=stripped,Well, I’ll call you Streaming-chan, then.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_penis2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_penis3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_penis3=stripped,It just seemed like fun. Plus, have you ever worked with 2B?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_pod2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod3=stripped,I think your little Pod on your head probably suits your purposes better.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_robone2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_robone3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_robone3=interested,Hm. I wonder if the simulation can actually do linked <i>stimulation</i> like that?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_smart2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart3=stripped,...I don’t follow, was that in insult?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_source2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source3=stripped,It’s a lot of data, though. Bandwidth to the Bunker isn’t always super available, so it’s important to be judicious.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_yorha2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha3=stripped,Why wouldn’t you save your work, or your identity? I get that it’s hard to lose yourself, but imagine losing all your footage to a network outage! Awful!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=happy,It's really quite a variable simulation, right, Twilight?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,And it’s a combat visor. Sort of like your helmet, but mine has a headsup display. Yours is mostly for shielding, right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=happy,It's a designation, Pit, something I was made with. But of course, I do really like Nines!
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=frustrated,As much as I'm enjoying this, it <i>is</i> a simulation.

1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_nines1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_nines1=calm,Either is fine. I like familiar people to call me Nines.
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod1=custom:Pod,Pod-153 is my technical support pod. It helps me buffer and save combat data, and with long range combat.
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_companions1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_companions1=happy,Well… there's 2B and 21O… I guess Jackass and the Popola and Devola models. I'd call them friends.
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_penis1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_penis1=frustrated,Well, I'm manufactured in human likeness…

1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_mulan1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_mulan1,count-mulan:1=frustrated,...No, but I was just curious to see how it played out.
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_natsuki1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_natsuki1,count-natsuki:1=clever,I have?
1-must_strip_winning=happy,Well, tonight’s study worked out really well. I think I’ll stop using it so stringently now.
1-must_strip_winning=confident,<i>Pod</i>, you can dethread the data coming in. Let me try this my way for a bit.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=confident,Oracle… Oh, because you observe behaviors? I get it!
1-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
1-must_strip_normal=interested,Close match so far. I’ll go ahead and store this test file for a bit.
1-must_strip_normal=clever,Yeah, yeah, I’ll turn off the systems data. It’s not hacking, but it is a bit unfair.
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:futaba=confident,Oracle… Oh, because you observe behaviors? I get it!

1-must_strip_losing=frustrated,I guess the combat data is less useful than I thought…
1-must_strip_losing=frustrated,<i>Pod</i>, scrap the working file and start over. Let’s try doing this a little looser now.

1-stripping=stripping,To make up for that last item, I’ll take my socks off with my boots.
1-stripping=stripping,I think I’ll keep the coat on for now. It’s a bit chilly, and apparently it’s important I don’t show my anatomy so early, or I’d have just started from the bottom and gone up.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,I think Oracle would be a great codename for me, too then. You’re kind of like a human Scanner, in a way!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I'm actually surprised you aren't familiar with Pod technology, Meia!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_2b1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_2b2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_2b2=stripping,Of course we’re together, we’re a team! ...Oh... romantically? N-no, I wouldn’t say that.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_ai1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_ai2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_ai2=stripping,Huh? Right. I think this is a simulation. Kizuna Ai thinks this is a video game for herself, and you think you’re streaming this live and in person.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_bondage1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_bondage2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_bondage2=stripping,Oh. Uh, hold on. <i>Pod</i>, can you look this up for me?

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_smart1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart2=stripping,Well, of course, that’s why I’m confident. I don’t see the problem. I’m sure you were built to do your career too, right, Streaming-chan?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_source1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source2=stripping,Hm… weird to answer this question considering how I’m playing this game… but I upload my memories and operating protocols to the Bunker between missions.

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_yorha1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha2=rage,That’s… that can’t be true! It’s impossible!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,I’m not much of an engineer. I mostly use data analysis and a lot of combat experience to make my assessments…

2-stripped=stripped,There. I took off my boots, my socks, and I shut down my tactical network.
2-stripped=stripped,Here we go, this should be a lot more fair, now.
2-stripped=stripped,Right now I’m just finding that the group of people in this simulation are certainly… Something else.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Xelor? What's that? Some sort of engineer?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,Oh, I see. So it’s unique… How about… Oathkeeper. Yeah. Oathkeeper! I like it!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,...I mean, surely you're familiar with androids, right?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,...Huh. Maybe you've been away from earth so long you aren't familiar with androids and our technology...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,It's an honor to compared to humanity, Palutena. Though, I'm not sure if you're joking or not...

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_smart1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart2=stripping,Well, of course, that’s why I’m confident. I don’t see the problem. I’m sure you were built to do your career too, right, Streaming-chan?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_source1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source2=stripping,Hm… weird to answer this question considering how I’m playing this game… but I upload my memories and operating protocols to the Bunker between missions.

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_yorha1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha2=rage,That’s… that can’t be true! It’s impossible!

#losing shorts
3-stripped=stripped,Androids don’t need nipples, and I hear they’re vestigial on male humans too. I hear the female models like them, though.
3-stripped=stripped,That was the biggest item I owned. Well, besides <i>Cruel Oath</i>, but why’d I want to bring weapons to a game like this?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Xelor? What's that? Some sort of engineer?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=excited,Oh, I never saw the point of that anatomical upgrade. I did have a penis built in, though, so don't worry, it's not a total loss for you, Elizabeth! (If you can make me lose two more times!)
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=clever,Well, one of us has to have a perfect figure, huh, Faye?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,So I suppose you should be happy with what I’m already showing?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jotaro=stripped,Of course. Why would I lie about that, Jotaro?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_tech=stripped,...with diamond and superconductive filaments to facillitate nervous transmission between our extremeties and our cortical blackbox... Does that answer the question, Jura?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_nips=stripped,...I'm telling you about cutting edge science more than six millenia after your era, and that's what you worry about?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=clever,You know, for someone who's been awfully embarrassed by losing, you sure like to stare, Mahiru...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mavis=stripped,I'd be really interested to hear more about this... "Uncle" of yours, Mavis... (<i>I certainly hope she's not a Machine sympathizer...</i>)
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,I mean, my modelers thought it was a superfluous detail. If no nipples is that offputting, I can put in a service request back on the Bunker.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_goron=frustrated,I don't understand what a Goron is... are they similar to androids? Creatures made from metal or something?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,I only have a bellybutton because it also operates as a data port... does your species nave nipples, Nayru?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Well, my core diagnostics say I'm running at a cozy 556K internally. That's Kelvin, if you're more familiar with archaic measures, Palutena.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Wait a second, you aren't an android too? The wings definitely don't seem human.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,marker:9s_pit_robot=frustrated,I am not a robot.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=excited,Oh? You can touch if you'd like, Pit! I've never had another male android touch me before, and I could touch you, since you're also shirtless.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=stripped,Too fast to be seen? My, you're a marvel of engineering! I'd love to study you, if that's okay? I bet your engineers even put in nipples!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=excited,Too fast to be seen? Well, you're on display to be studied now! I like how your designers even built in nipple and stimuli receptors!

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_nines2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_nines3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_nines3=stripped,Well, I’ll call you Streaming-chan, then.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_penis2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_penis3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_penis3=stripped,It just seemed like fun. Plus, have you ever worked with 2B?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_pod2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod3=stripped,I think your little Pod on your head probably suits your purposes better.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_smart2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart3=stripped,...I don’t follow, was that in insult?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_source2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source3=stripped,It’s a lot of data, though. Bandwidth to the Bunker isn’t always super available, so it’s important to be judicious.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_yorha2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha3=stripped,Why wouldn’t you save your work, or your identity? I get that it’s hard to lose yourself, but imagine losing all your footage to a network outage! Awful!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=stripped,Well, I'm a person, just an android, Twilight. It's like me saying you aren't a person because you're a Pony.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,I think most humans seem to find this unusual about my body.
3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_bondage1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_bondage1=interested,Like… servitude?

3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Uh, I’m working on that Futaba. And a Phantom Thief? I don’t think I’d ever need to steal something. Though I guess hacking <i>is</i> kind of theft.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Huh? Why shouldn't I be? Isn't losing part of the fun of this game?

4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_companions1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_companions2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_companions2=stripping,I… sometimes wonder if I'd like to.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_fight1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_fight2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_fight2=stripping,Grenade hands? I’ve seen some B-class models use explosive gauntlets…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_mulan1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_mulan2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_mulan2=stripping,…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_natsuki1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_natsuki2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_natsuki2=stripping,Oh, I guess you’re right. Sorry, her pigment reminds me of someone I know from the Bunker. My operator, 21O in fact.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_nines1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_nines2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_nines2=stripping,9S is just my birth name. Model No. 9, Type S. So, I guess it’s a job and a title together.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_penis1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_penis2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_penis2=stripping,A…? Oh, no, I had to request that.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_pod1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod2=stripping,You could say that. Pod-153’s still hanging about.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_robone1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_robone2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_robone2=stripping,I can only assume you’re talking about my genital installation…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_smart1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart2=stripping,Well, of course, that’s why I’m confident. I don’t see the problem. I’m sure you were built to do your career too, right, Streaming-chan?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_source1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source2=stripping,Hm… weird to answer this question considering how I’m playing this game… but I upload my memories and operating protocols to the Bunker between missions. Sometimes, the Machines do overwhelm me, and I need to recover my last OS.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_yorha1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha2=rage,That’s… that can’t be true! It’s impossible!


#losing blindfold
5-stripped=stripped,I’m a little shy, so don’t mind me while I let this system warm up a bit.
5-stripped=stripped,I haven’t shown anyone this before, so forgive me a bit if I fiddle with it to get it running.
5-stripped=stripped,Of course I’d keep the visor. What? And lose my tactical advantage while you’re all distracted?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Xelor? What's that? Some sort of engineer?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=clever,Oh, sorry Elizabeth. It's... As natural as the rest of me? I suppose?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:florina=stripped,I'm a male-classified robot. We aren't... uh, born with fully humanoid anatomy, but I wanted to get it installed to see what it was like.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,You’re so strange, Futaba, but you seem to be enjoying this, so why change a winning strategy?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=stripped,Well, Jura, I'm best in class for my model, so once I figure out how the anatomy works, I wouldn't mind testing it with you, I suppose.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=frustrated,The engineers are supposed to be really good, Mahiru! I thought it was only supposed to get rigid later...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=clever,Yeah, yeah, Meia, it should be functional in the same way a human's is... let me know if your curiosity gets the better of you.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Well. Uh, thanks, Palutena! (She's so comforting!)
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,No, Pit. I'm not an automaton. I have wills, desires, and thanks to optional upgrades, the equipment to deliver on them.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=interested,I'm... actually not sure. I don't think it <i>explodes</i>, but I think human and most mammals shoot something when they achieve climax. I haven't tested my anatomy until this simulation. Have you, Shimakaze?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_2b2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_2b3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_2b3=stripped,Subtlety goes a long way, Streaming-chan.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_ai2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_ai3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_ai3=frustrated,I guess I don’t really have a choice to say no? N-not that I’m opposed to it…
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_bondage2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_bondage3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_bondage3=stripped,I-- <i>wow</i>. Humans are into some rather interesting sensory experiences.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_companions2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_companions3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_companions3=stripped,They're certainly attractive!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_fight2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_fight3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_fight3=stripped,I tend to prefer the offense, myself, but I’m happy to be impressive!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_mulan2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_mulan3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_mulan3=rage,...I blame faulty intel.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_natsuki2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_natsuki3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_natsuki3=stripped,..Natsuki’s kind of got a similar personality too. I’m sure she’ll warm up later.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_nines2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_nines3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_nines3=stripped,Well, I’ll call you Streaming-chan, then.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_penis2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_penis3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_penis3=stripped,It just seemed like fun. Plus, have you ever worked with 2B?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_pod2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod3=stripped,I think your little Pod on your head probably suits your purposes better.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_robone2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_robone3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_robone3=interested,Hm. I wonder if the simulation can actually do linked <i>stimulation</i> like that?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_smart2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart3=stripped,...I don’t follow, was that in insult?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_source2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source3=stripped,It’s a lot of data, though. Bandwidth to the Bunker isn’t always super available, so it’s important to be judicious.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_yorha2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha3=stripped,Why wouldn’t you save your work, or your identity? I get that it’s hard to lose yourself, but imagine losing all your footage to a network outage! Awful!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=stripped,Twilight, I'm not very familiar with this. Could you help me out?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=confident,We certainly are an trio, aren't we? After this, maybe we should... <i>Pod</i> what's the euphemism? Oh! Get to know each other!
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:jura=rage,I am <i>not</i> a dungeon bot, or machine, or whatever it is you're implying.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_bondage1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_bondage1=interested,Like… servitude?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_robone1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_robone1=calm,Lilim… you mean like an android?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_smart1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_smart1=frustrated,Why shouldn’t I be?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_yorha1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_yorha1=frustrated,Pardon me?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_2b1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_2b1=excited,2B is my partner, she focuses on combat while I focus on scanning and intelligence.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_fight1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_fight1=interested,Scanner models are designed to gather intelligence. I’ve actually become quite skilled with weapons, but not as much as a dedicated unit.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_nines1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_nines1=calm,Either is fine. I like familiar people to call me Nines.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod1=custom:Pod,Pod-153 is my technical support pod. It helps me buffer and save combat data, and with long range combat.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_companions1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_companions1=happy,Well… there's 2B and 21O… I guess Jackass and the Popola and Devola models. I'd call them friends.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_penis1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_penis1=frustrated,Well, I'm manufactured in human likeness…
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_source1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_source1=interested,Yes, Designate Streaming-chan?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_ai1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_ai1,count-kizuna:1=clever,The simulation does seem predisposed to digital-types… all we’d need is a geeky programmer or something, right?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_mulan1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_mulan1,count-mulan:1=frustrated,...No, but I was just curious to see how it played out.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_natsuki1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_natsuki1,count-natsuki:1=clever,I have?
5-must_strip_winning=happy,Okay, everyone else’s either naked, masturbating, or pretty close to one of those. I wouldn’t mind trying that out.
5-must_strip_winning=clever,There. Now we should be all evened up.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
5-must_strip_normal=clever,I played almost a full game with my HUD. It’ll be nice to see you all with my own eyes.
5-must_strip_normal=calm,A loss is a loss.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
5-must_strip_losing=confident,Last countermeasure.
5-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
5-stripping=stripping,Usually this gets blown away by a big explosion. Then I die. So this is kind of an improvement.
5-stripping=stripping,It’s nice to take this off in a non-dramatic fashion, but I’m not thrilled that I’m losing my edge.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:cammy=stripping,Absolutely. It helps me process most of this tactical data.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripping,Well, it is the hardpoint for most of my tactical data. It's easier for Pod to stream directly to it than my brain, you know?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Er, no, my <i>combat visor</i> is useful, but I can still win if I hang in there another round, Futaba.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,Uh, unless you have class 41-S optical components, I think you'll find this frustrating, but I have a feeling wearing a blindfold isn't a new experience, Jura.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:juri=stripping,...I can kind of see your point, Juri.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:mavis=stripping,Well, it's this or forfeit. Even with a single core active in my system, I intend to fight.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Oh, I've got a round or two left in me, Meia. Let me take off my, again, <i>tactical visor</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=stripping,My visor is used as a focal mount for most of my combat data. I wouldn't want too many optics built into my eyes, after all.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripping,Of course I'd have to take this off <i>eventually</i>, Rinkah, it's just more tactically useful than my boxers...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripping,Finally, someone with taste and knowledge! It has radar, LI-dar, and other sensory apparatuses--
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,marker:shima_recon=stripping,Of course, Shimakaze. Good recon intel is critical to complete a mission against the machines with minimal casualties.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_2b1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_2b2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_2b2=stripping,Of course we’re together, we’re a team! ...Oh... romantically? N-no, I wouldn’t say that.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_ai1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_ai2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_ai2=stripping,Huh? Right. I think this is a simulation. Kizuna Ai thinks this is a video game for herself, and you think you’re streaming this live and in person.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_bondage1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_bondage2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_bondage2=stripping,Oh. Uh, hold on. <i>Pod</i>, can you look this up for me?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_companions1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_companions2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_companions2=stripping,I… sometimes wonder if I'd like to.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_fight1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_fight2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_fight2=stripping,Grenade hands? I’ve seen some B-class models use explosive gauntlets…

5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_natsuki1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_natsuki2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_natsuki2=stripping,Oh, I guess you’re right. Sorry, her pigment reminds me of someone I know from the Bunker. My operator, 21O in fact.

#naked
-3-stripped=stripped,It’s not a blindfold, people. It’s a tactical visor. Only an idiot would walk around on the battlefield blind.
-3-stripped=stripped,It’s not a blindfold. My tactical visor was uh, helping me keep track of all your playstyles. This’ll be harder now.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Xelor? What's that? Some sort of engineer?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:cammy=stripped,Well, Cammy, we can't all get to fight our way out of our clothes.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripped,Huh. Well, thank you, Chun-Li!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Oh, you think I'm cute? Thanks! I’m glad you’re one of the first humans I met. You’re a bit strange, but you’re also very smart and entertaining. I’d work with you again in the future! Uh, maybe in a less... intimate setting, though.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:juri=stripped,I didn't, but now I can <i>see your point</i> even better.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=stripped,Oh. Huh. Well, thanks, Mahiru. I'll have my Pod do a data sync with yours after the game, I suppose. I think mine has higher fidelity.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mavis=stripped,I suppose that's a compliment to both of us. I'll return the favor: your eyes are also beautiful!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Sheesh. Here you go. You and 2B would get along like nobody's business, Meia.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stripped,Cheating's an incredibly harsh word. I don't say you're cheating when you use drunkenness as an excuse to flirt, do I?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,Thank you! Pit gets it! At least we get to reboot with our memories intact, right? It has to be hard for mere mortals. And uh, yes, I do have eyes. Why wouldn't <i>eye</i>?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,I mean, Rinkah, I saw you staring. You being distracted has more weight than me removing my visor.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripped,I see! An external connection to your command is very interesting. Do you ever worry about being hacked...? Or... maybe you like that risk?

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_must_strip=rage,What’s this? I can’t scan ~name~? Hrm. <i>Pod,</i> reboot to more context sensitive data.

0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.

0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
0-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
0-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.

0-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?

0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,~Name~’s last item. I’m not thrilled I didn’t generate good data. To beat you without even having a pair is...

0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…

0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.

0-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
0-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
0-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.

0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.

0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…

0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?

0-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.

0-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?

0-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.

0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?

0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?

0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!

0-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
0-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
0-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
0-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
0-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
0-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
0-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
0-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=interested,I’m interested to see what ~name~’s going to choose as her first play.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,~name~’s first item. <i>Pod</i>, give me a character analysis based on norepinephrine and cortisol levels.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,This isn’t your first loss, ~name~, but I don’t expect you diverge from pattern…
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,I’m not quite sure why this anticipation is so appealing, but I can’t wait to see what ~name~ takes off next!
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Male YorHa models tend to either perform really well or really poorly. Not that ~name~’s playing badly but she’s over halfway done and I haven’t lost at all yet…
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,I wish 2B were here. She might be bored but she’d at least give me a challenge.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,This is it!
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,~name~’s last item. I’m not thrilled I didn’t generate good data, but I’m still enjoying the rush of a clean win.

0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,Looks like you’re falling behind, ~name~. You going to keep up with me?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,Looks like we’re cracking ~name~’s firewall. I wonder what countermeasures he’s got in store?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=clever,Looks like you’re falling behind, ~name~. I won't pretend that first play was impressive.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=confident,Looks like we’re cracking ~name~’s firewall. I wonder what countermeasures he’s got in store? Hopefully something adaptive. That was a weak hand he lost with.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,My lead’s growing, ~name~.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Okay, I think I’m starting to get ~name~’s playstyle. No hacking needed, just observation.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=calm,My lead’s growing, ~name~. You going to, uh, pick a better hand next round?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=happy,Okay, I think I’m starting to get ~name~’s playstyle. No hacking needed, just observation. I might not even need to swap cards after winning with <i>this</i>.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Too easy.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Really, ~name~? Are you trying <i>at all</i>?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=confident,Too easy. Seriously? Winning with a high card?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,Really, ~name~? Are you trying <i>at all</i>? You should've beaten this hand.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,This is it for ~name~, right? No more tricks!
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,Here comes the best part of the simulation!
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,This is it for ~name~, right? No more tricks? I can't believe you lost to this hand... are you that excited to lose?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=happy,~Name~, did you just... lose to a high card? Really?

1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:prince=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.

1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>

1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him again for these "Trion" particles.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.

1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,So what <i>is</i> this Stand thing?
1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=confident,I see. So you can stop time, briefly... fascinating.
1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=confident,I don't need to be a Scanner to know you're reaching your limit. Was a little game too much for you to handle?
1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=clever,Hardly impossible, Kamina.
1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:1=frustrated,My model predicts that it'll be your wristwear.

1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:3=happy,At least you're a humble loser.
1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,My model predicts your bandages... but after that...

1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, what do you mean his hair doesn't match his DNA?
1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,You look like you're seen your share of combat. Do you prefer melee or ranged attacks?
1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=frustrated,Hey, Ryuji, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I forget that humans are less interchangable than Androids... well, at least as far as repairs go.
1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=interested,I think I understand. Ryuji, you're some sort of forward operating fighter, right?
1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,There we go. Thanks for giving me time to get my strategy together, but I'm not going to go easy on you now.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,Time to even up the score. And some people thought I'd need to hack in here.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Aw, come on. ~name~, are you even trying?
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,<i>Pod</i>, load ~name~’s emotive scan to my visor. I’m wondering if he’s playing the long game. Or just playing around.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,I might report you to the Commander. This is not what I signed up for, ~name~.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,So, ~name~, am I good at cards or what?
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,you know, I can't help but feel ~name~’s last item might be his most satisfying.
1-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,That's the last of ~name~’s apparel. It should be pretty easy from here...

1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,We’re even now, ~name~, but I think I’ve got you figured out now.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=clever,Even with some errors... <i>I</i> didn't expect to win with this.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=confident,I've got you squared away, ~name~. You lost even when I had a high card. I expected more.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=excited,I told you I wouldn’t make this easy, ~name~.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,Was it worth the gloves, ~name~?
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=excited,I wasn't planning on making it easy... but really? You lost when this was my hand?

1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=clever,You're really getting desperate, huh? I think you're taking far too many risks if I can beat you with this.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=excited,Well, the gloves came off, and now ~name~’s getting naked. Great combat data and easy on the eyes.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,Hm. ~name~’s last item. <i>Pod</i>, sync behavior to the model.
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=excited,I lost the gloves... but you seem to have lost your nerve. You're not playing so well, huh, ~name~?
1-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=clever,<i>Pod</i>, don't sync behavior to the model... this play isn't worth recording.
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-akko:0,count-2b:0=confident,Hm... I wonder if this would play better as a co-op game. You, "Akko," and 2B and myself.

1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
1-female_must_strip,target:akko,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:akko_boy1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:akko_boy1=frustrated,I still don’t have a good grasp on all the optical illusions and rapid evolutions you’re doing, Akko…
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
1-female_must_strip,target:ann_takamaki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ann_standards1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:ann_standards1=interested,Ann’s an android?
1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=interested,The Ultimate Programmer? Hm... I wonder what your mind's alpha patterns look like...
1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.
1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a--

1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_9s1=calm,I'm a scanner type, but hacking is something I do, yes.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…

1-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Haru. Can I... rest my head against your chest after this?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.

1-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.
1-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.

1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=clever,Looks like my strategy held up better than yours, Raven.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
1-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
1-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.

1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,There we go. It just took a hand or two to get your pattern down, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,We’re even now, ~name~, but I think I’ve got you figured out now.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=excited,I told you I wouldn’t make this easy, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,Was it worth the gloves, ~name~?
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,Oh! ~name~’s turn again.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,Okay, ~name~’s really running out of options now.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=excited,Well, the gloves came off, and now ~name~’s getting naked. Great combat data and easy on the eyes.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,Hm. ~name~’s last item. <i>Pod</i>, sync behavior to the model.
1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.

1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,There we go. Thanks for giving me time to get my strategy together, but I'm not going to go easy on you now.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,Time to even up the score. And some people thought I'd need to hack in here.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=happy,There we go. Thanks for giving me time to get my strategy together, but I'm not going to go easy on you now. Especially with that last hand. Not impressive.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=clever,Time to even up the score. And some people thought I'd need to hack to win. I just need to not have worse cards than ~name~.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Aw, come on. ~name~, are you even trying?
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,<i>Pod</i>, load ~name~’s emotive scan to my visor. I’m wondering if he’s playing the long game. Or just playing around.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,Aw, come on. ~name~, are you even trying? I had <i>one</i> good card.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=clever,<i>Pod</i>, load ~name~’s emotive scan to my visor. I’m wondering if he’s playing the long game. Or just... deliberately throwing.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,I might report you to the Commander. This is not what I signed up for, ~name~.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,So, ~name~, am I good at cards or what?
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,I might report you to the Commander. This is not what I signed up for, ~name~. Throwing your hand like that?
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=interested,So, ~name~, am I good at cards or what? I wasn't supposed to win without even a pair...
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,You know, I can't help but feel ~name~’s last item might be his most satisfying.
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,That's the last of ~name~’s apparel. It should be pretty easy from here...
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=confident,You know, I can't help but feel ~name~’s last item might be his most satisfying. Considering how little effort I spent on that hand...
1-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=clever,That's the last of ~name~’s apparel. The others should be a bit more of a challenge, right?

2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=calm,Huh. Corrin again?
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a scan on Jin. I'm detecting temporal anomalies...

2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,I'm detecting an incredibly volatile powersource on Jin's waist... what kind of sword <i>are</i> you using?
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him again for these "Trion" particles.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.
2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,So... I have a prediction of my own. Is it your hat that's next?
2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,So what <i>is</i> this Stand thing?
2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=confident,I see. So you can stop time, briefly... fascinating.
2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=confident,I don't need to be a Scanner to know you're reaching your limit. Was a little game too much for you to handle?
2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=clever,Hardly impossible, Kamina.
2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:1=frustrated,My model predicts that it'll be your wristwear.
2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, scan Kamina... again.
2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:3=happy,At least you're a humble loser.
2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,My model predicts your bandages... but after that...
2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:5=interested,An arousing speech...

2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=interested,He's certainly handsome... but so placid. It's hard to get a read on him.
2-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:1=happy,Kira, what's your... uh, deal?

2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)

2-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=frustrated,Hey, Ryuji, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I forget that humans are less interchangable than Androids... well, at least as far as repairs go.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=interested,I think I understand. Ryuji, you're some sort of forward operating fighter, right?
2-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
2-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,Time to catch up, ~name~.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,Finally. I was worried you’d manage to keep your win streak going.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,What’ve you got for us <i>this</i> time, ~name~?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,You’re looking cold, ~name~. I guess this is the opposite of what you’d call a hot streak, huh?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=rage,You know, ~name~, male YorHa models are supposed to be the advanced ones. You’re not really doing a lot for humanity or male androids if you’re playing so poorly.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,Huh. Most men tend to run out of countermeasures by now.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,~name~ is almost done. Without countermeasures he shouldn’t

2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,I should’ve taken you more seriously, ~name~.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,You’re playing well, ~name~. I’m impressed.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=excited,Hm. I'd take you more seriously if you could do better than that hand.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=calm,You're playing well enough to have lasted until now without losing... but I expected to need a better hand.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,We’re really close! I’m glad you’re putting up a good fight. That’s always a better way to generate combat data.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=confident,Well, plus or minus one piece, it looks like you’re also burning through your countermeasures.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=happy,We’re really close! I’m glad you’re putting up a good fight. Well, besides this last hand.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=confident,Well, plus or minus one piece, it looks like you’re also burning through your countermeasures. Is that why you went with that hand?
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,Win-loss ratio exceeding 2.00…
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=calm,Hm. What’s next for ~name~? <i>Pod</i> record this carefully. For… 21O’s metrics. Of course.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=happy,Win-loss ratio exceeding 2.00… if ~name~'s going to lose to a hand like that, it should be smooth from here.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=calm,Hm. What’s next for ~name~? <i>Pod</i> record this carefully. Why that hand? Nothing better in the deck, or did you forget to trade?
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,They say No.2 and No.9 units tend to be compatible as field partners. It’s a shame our item summary is surpassing nine. Okay, this is a contrived joke, but you’re starting to seem stressed, ~name~.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=calm,I’m not finished yet either, ~name~, but I’ve got a lot further to go. Thanks for the analysis.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=clever,They say No.2 and No.9 units tend to be compatible as field partners. It’s a shame our item summary is surpassing nine. Okay, this is a contrived joke, but you’re starting to seem stressed, ~name~, especially with that throwaway hand.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=calm,I’m not finished yet either, ~name~, but I’ve got a lot further to go. Want to make a better play next turn?
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-akko:0,count-2b:0=confident,Hm... I wonder if this would play better as a co-op game. You, "Akko," and 2B and myself.
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0,count-monster:3-=happy,Huh... now that you mention it, ~player~ and I are a bit out of place, huh?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…

2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.

2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--

2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.

2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
2-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=interested,The Ultimate Programmer? Hm... I wonder what your mind's alpha patterns look like...
2-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
2-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
2-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.

2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_9s1=calm,I'm a scanner type, but hacking is something I do, yes.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
2-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.

2-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:2=interested,(<i>She has such a calming presence...</i>)
2-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:4=interested,Huh? Are you activating your berserk mode?
2-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:seductingplayer=frustrated,...Some of us at the table wouldn't mind attention either, Haru.
2-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Haru. Can I... rest my head against your chest after this?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.
2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,totalRounds:7=custom:Pod,~silent~
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
2-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.
2-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.

2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.

2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=clever,Looks like my strategy held up better than yours, Raven.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
2-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
2-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,I should’ve taken you more seriously, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,You’re playing well, ~name~. I’m impressed.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,We’re really close! I’m glad you’re putting up a good fight. That’s always a better way to generate combat data.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=confident,Well, plus or minus one piece, it looks like you’re also burning through your countermeasures.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,Win-loss ratio exceeding 2.00…
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=calm,Hm. What’s next for ~name~? <i>Pod</i> record this carefully. For… 21O’s metrics. Of course.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,They say No.2 and No.9 units tend to be compatible as field partners. It’s a shame our item summary is surpassing nine. Okay, this is a contrived joke, but you’re starting to seem stressed, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=calm,I’m not finished yet either, ~name~, but I’ve got a lot further to go. Thanks for the analysis.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=confident,Hard to fault android number crunching with a hand like this.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=clever,Close, ~name~. But not close enough.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=confident,Hard to fault android number crunching with a hand like this.
2-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=clever,Close, ~name~. But not close enough.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,Time to catch up, ~name~.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,Finally. I was worried you’d manage to keep your win streak going.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=happy,Time to catch up, ~name~. Luck can't keep you untouched forever.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=excited,Finally. I was worried you’d manage to keep your win streak going. But, like the model predicted, it was probably a fluke.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,What’ve you got for us <i>this</i> time, ~name~?
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,You’re looking cold, ~name~. I guess this is the opposite of what you’d call a hot streak, huh?
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=clever,What’ve you got for us <i>this</i> time, ~name~? Besides no playable cards.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=calm,You’re looking cold, ~name~. I guess this is the opposite of what you’d call a hot streak, huh...? Your hand was unnaturally awful.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=rage,You know, ~name~, male YorHa models are supposed to be the advanced ones. You’re not really doing a lot for humanity or male androids if you’re playing so poorly.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,Huh. Most men tend to run out of countermeasures by now.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=rage,You know, ~name~, male YorHa models are supposed to be the advanced ones. You’re not really doing a lot for humanity or male androids if you’re playing so poorly. Is that your best? For me to win with <i>this</i>?
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=clever,Huh. Most men tend to run out of countermeasures by now. Are you just trying to finish up and watch us?
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,~name~ is almost done. Without countermeasures he shouldn’t try risky plays like that.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,This is it. ~name~ is officially out of defenses now.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=clever,~name~ is almost done. No countermeasures could've helped with that play, either.
2-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=confident,This is it. ~name~ is officially out of defenses now. And to be taken down by a single card...? Humbling.

3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:prince=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
3-male_must_strip,target:adrien,targetStage:2-7,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:cn_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:cn_9s1=frustrated,...Is this a joke about me being an android?
3-male_must_strip,target:adrien,targetStage:2-7,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<=6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:cn_smell1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:cn_smell1=calm,Pod, what can you tell me about his olfactory profile?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.
3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=calm,Huh. Corrin again?
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a scan on Jin. I'm detecting temporal anomalies...
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a scan on Jin. I'm detecting more temporal anomalies...
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,I'm detecting an incredibly volatile powersource on Jin's waist... what kind of sword <i>are</i> you using?
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him again for these "Trion" particles.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,So... I have a prediction of my own. Is it your hat that's next?
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,So what <i>is</i> this Stand thing?
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=confident,I see. So you can stop time, briefly... fascinating.
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=confident,I don't need to be a Scanner to know you're reaching your limit. Was a little game too much for you to handle?
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=clever,Hardly impossible, Kamina.
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:1=frustrated,My model predicts that it'll be your wristwear.
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, scan Kamina... again.
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:3=happy,At least you're a humble loser.
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,My model predicts your bandages... but after that...
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:5=interested,An arousing speech...
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:6=excited,You're really good at this inspiring speech stuff, Kamina!
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=interested,He's certainly handsome... but so placid. It's hard to get a read on him.
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:1=happy,Kira, what's your... uh, deal?
3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:7=clever,Looks like you're going to be "Biting Za Dusto."

3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=interested,(Hmm. Is there something going on between Pit and Annie? They seem so furtive.)
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, what do you mean his hair doesn't match his DNA?
3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,You look like you're seen your share of combat. Do you prefer melee or ranged attacks?
3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=frustrated,Hey, Ryuji, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I forget that humans are less interchangable than Androids... well, at least as far as repairs go.
3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=interested,I think I understand. Ryuji, you're some sort of forward operating fighter, right?
3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=interested,Just starting now, ~name~?
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,You managed to hold out until now? Good play, ~name~.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Here I was, getting worried you’d put up your shields.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,It’s a shame you’re human, ~name~, or I’d let you borrow some of my chipsets. I have one just for recovery.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,I’m not too far ahead, but this tactical simulation doesn’t preclude a come from behind victory...
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,I’ll admit, I’m more interested to see what you look like unarmored more than getting data, ~name~.
3-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,That’s No.8. Not like the YorHa model, but… You know, I’m just going to enjoy this.

3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,Some Scanner-types would be jealous that their data is so off prediction, but I just see this as a chance to learn more.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:Nothing=excited,Wow, ~name~, I’m surprised. I didn’t take you for a strategy-type! You’re playing really well! Even though you lost to a high card, I want to see your strategy.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:Nothing=happy,Some Scanner-types would be jealous that their data is so off prediction, but I just see this as a chance to learn more. What kind of feint was that?
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,<i>Pod</i>, use the high-quality streaming for this. Uh. For better data analysis later.

3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,I’m not that far behind you, ~name~. I think I’ve generated pretty good data by now, so strip whatever you’d like.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=calm,If you want to stand a little closer, we can talk strategy, ~name~. Like why you only had a single card there...

3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,Well, time for ~name~ to take a bow.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,That’s it for ~name~! I hope you can appreciate what I’m showing. I have a feeling I’m about to.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=happy,Well, time for ~name~ to take a bow. Generous of you to throw that hand.
3-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=interested,That’s it for ~name~! I appreciate you taking a graceful loss at the end... assuming you had better cards than just a high card before the swap?
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-akko:0,count-2b:0=confident,Hm... I wonder if this would play better as a co-op game. You, "Akko," and 2B and myself.

3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
3-female_must_strip,target:akko,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:akko_boy1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:akko_boy1=frustrated,I still don’t have a good grasp on all the optical illusions and rapid evolutions you’re doing, Akko…
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
3-female_must_strip,target:ann_takamaki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ann_standards1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:ann_standards1=interested,Ann’s an android?
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=interested,The Ultimate Programmer? Hm... I wonder what your mind's alpha patterns look like...
3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.
3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a--

3-female_must_strip,target:coco,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:coco_sg1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:coco_sg1=calm,Style…? That’s it?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_9s1=calm,I'm a scanner type, but hacking is something I do, yes.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
3-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.

3-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:4=interested,Huh? Are you activating your berserk mode?
3-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:seductingplayer=frustrated,...Some of us at the table wouldn't mind attention either, Haru.
3-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Haru. Can I... rest my head against your chest after this?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,totalRounds:7=custom:Pod,~silent~
3-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
3-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.
3-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.

3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nat_doujins1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:nat_doujins1=interested,Hmm… her cortisol levels are rising…
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan entity: Raven.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=clever,Looks like my strategy held up better than yours, Raven.
3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
3-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
3-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
3-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, ~name~, I’m surprised. I didn’t take you for a strategy-type! You’re playing really well!
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,Some Scanner-types would be jealous that their data is so off prediction, but I just see this as a chance to learn more.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,<i>Pod</i>, use the high-quality streaming for this. Uh. For better data analysis later.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=excited,Now that I’m pretty exposed, I’m quite a bit more interested in what you have to lose, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=calm,If you want to stand a little closer, we can talk strategy, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,I’m not that far behind you, ~name~. I think I’ve generated pretty good data by now, so strip whatever you’d like.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,Well, time for ~name~ to take a bow.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,That’s it for ~name~! I hope you can appreciate what I’m showing. I have a feeling I’m about to.

3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=interested,Just starting now, ~name~?
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,You managed to hold out until now? Good play, ~name~.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=interested,Just starting now, ~name~? You probably could've gotten better cards.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=calm,You managed to hold out until now, only to blow your streak on <i>that</i>?
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Here I was, getting worried you’d put up your shields.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,It’s a shame you’re human, ~name~, or I’d let you borrow some of my chipsets. I have one just for recovery.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=happy,Here I was, getting worried you’d put up your shields. Guess even you can make bad plays.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=clever,It’s a shame you’re human, ~name~, or I’d let you borrow some of my chipsets. I have one just for recovery. You must be desperate if I won with this hand.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,I’m not too far ahead, but this tactical simulation doesn’t preclude a come from behind victory...
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,I’ll admit, I’m more interested to see what you look like unarmored more than getting data, ~name~.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=confident,I’m not too far ahead, but this tactical simulation doesn’t preclude a come from behind victory... especially if you play like that for another hand or two.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=interested,I’ll admit, I’m more interested to see what you look like unarmored more than getting data, ~name~. Thanks for tossing out that hand, I think.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,That’s No.8. Not like the YorHa model, but… You know, I’m just going to enjoy this.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=calm,Hope you didn’t stash any Reset chips on you, ~name~.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=happy,That’s No.8. Not like the YorHa model, but… your hand wasn't exactly very good either.
3-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=calm,Hope you didn’t stash any Reset chips on you, ~name~. It'd be brutal to lose those, given that hand.

4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:prince=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
4-male_must_strip,target:adrien,targetStage:2-7,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:cn_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:cn_9s1=frustrated,...Is this a joke about me being an android?
4-male_must_strip,target:adrien,targetStage:2-7,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<=6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:cn_smell1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:cn_smell1=calm,Pod, what can you tell me about his olfactory profile?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.
4-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=calm,Huh. Corrin again?
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a scan on Jin. I'm detecting temporal anomalies...
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a scan on Jin. I'm detecting more temporal anomalies...
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,I'm detecting an incredibly volatile powersource on Jin's waist... what kind of sword <i>are</i> you using?
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him again for these "Trion" particles.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
4-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,So... I have a prediction of my own. Is it your hat that's next?
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,So what <i>is</i> this Stand thing?
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=confident,I see. So you can stop time, briefly... fascinating.
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=confident,I don't need to be a Scanner to know you're reaching your limit. Was a little game too much for you to handle?
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=clever,Hardly impossible, Kamina.
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:1=frustrated,My model predicts that it'll be your wristwear.
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, scan Kamina... again.
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:3=happy,At least you're a humble loser.
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,My model predicts your bandages... but after that...
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:5=interested,An arousing speech...
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:6=excited,You're really good at this inspiring speech stuff, Kamina!
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=interested,He's certainly handsome... but so placid. It's hard to get a read on him.
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:1=happy,Kira, what's your... uh, deal?
4-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:7=clever,Looks like you're going to be "Biting Za Dusto."
4-male_must_strip,target:mccree,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mccree_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mccree_9s1=clever,She doesn’t mean a fight, does she? It’d be hardly fair with my pod--

4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=interested,(Hmm. Is there something going on between Pit and Annie? They seem so furtive.)
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
4-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, what do you mean his hair doesn't match his DNA?
4-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,You look like you're seen your share of combat. Do you prefer melee or ranged attacks?
4-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=frustrated,Hey, Ryuji, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I forget that humans are less interchangable than Androids... well, at least as far as repairs go.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=interested,I think I understand. Ryuji, you're some sort of forward operating fighter, right?
4-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
4-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait a second, have I missed the fact you haven’t lost <i>anything</i> so far?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,You’re really great at this, ~name~. The combat data you’ve generated has been really interesting.
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hm. What’s next for you, ~name~?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,So I’m down to my shorts, what are you going to be taking off, ~name~?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,You’re keeping even with me, ~name~.
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,Oh! ~name~, you’re just about finished, right? Could this be it, or are you hiding something?
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=calm,This is your last round, ~name~. <i>Pod</i>, check vitals to make sure his encounter data is accurate.
4-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,Whew, you played well! This is your last countermeasure, right?
4-female_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.

4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=calm,I’m not going to get too stressed out, I have a full layer of primary protection, and my visor. Plus, you just lost to a high card. I think your rally is over.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,<i>Pod,</i> reboot and resync with the Bunker. ~Player~ might be getting tired, since she just lost against <i>this</i> hand.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,I'm impressed, ~name~.

4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=happy,I'm impressed, ~name~. You've been playing well. Looks like your luck is turning, though.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=interested,I'm running out of options here, but ~name~ being so far ahead just makes me want to play harder! That moment of weakness where you lost to my high card'll cost you! I swear!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,~name~, your tactical data is actually finished. Do whatever you'd like.
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,We’re almost done, ~name~, but no matter what happens if was fun serving with you!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=clever,~name~, your tactical data is actually finished. But you already knew that, huh? Why else would you lose to a single high card?
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=happy,We’re almost done, ~name~, but no matter what happens if was fun serving with you... even when you got a bad hand!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,This is it! ~name~’s lost her last countermeasure!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,That has to be it for you, right?
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=confident,This is it! ~name~’s lost her last countermeasure! And to a high card!
4-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7,hasHand:High Card=interested,That has to be it for you, right? This was so tense! I didn't think I'd win with that!
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-akko:0,count-2b:0=confident,Hm... I wonder if this would play better as a co-op game. You, "Akko," and 2B and myself.
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0,count-monster:3-=happy,Huh... now that you mention it, ~player~ and I are a bit out of place, huh?

4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
4-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
4-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.

4-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=interested,The Ultimate Programmer? Hm... I wonder what your mind's alpha patterns look like...
4-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
4-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
4-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.

4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
4-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?

4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…

4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
4-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.

4-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.

4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan entity: Raven.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can't believe you've outplayed me and are complaining about strategy. Maybe there's something to this magic thing.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
4-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
4-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
4-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
4-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
4-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.

4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...

4-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
4-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
4-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?

4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?

4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
4-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
4-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…

4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.

4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
4-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!

4-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,I’m not going to get too stressed out, I have a full layer of primary protection, and my visor.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Pod,</i> reboot and resync with the Bunker. I'm surprised I'm doing so poorly...

4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,You’re really great at this, ~name~. The combat data you’ve generated has been really interesting.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,Wait a second, have I missed the fact you haven’t lost <i>anything</i> so far? And you <i>just</i> played that?
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=excited,You’re really great at this, ~name~. The combat data you’ve generated has been really interesting. But, has your luck run out? I probably should've lost with this hand.

4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,So I’m down to my shorts, what are you going to be taking off, ~name~?
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=calm,Hm. What’s next for you, ~name~? Hopefully a better, more interesting hand.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=interested,So I’m down to my shorts, what are you going to be taking off, ~name~? Hopefully not your pride. That wasn't the best play, huh?

4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,Oh! ~name~, you’re just about finished, right? Could this be it, or are you hiding something?
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=happy,You’re keeping even with me, ~name~. Well, you would be, if you didn't make sloppy plays like losing to a high card.
4-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=interested,Oh! ~name~, you’re just about finished, right? Could this be it, or are you hiding something? That play's unlike the others you've done...

5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
5-female_must_strip,target:akko,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:akko_boy1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:akko_boy1=frustrated,I still don’t have a good grasp on all the optical illusions and rapid evolutions you’re doing, Akko…
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
5-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
5-female_must_strip,target:ann_takamaki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ann_standards1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:ann_standards1=interested,Ann’s an android?
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
5-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=interested,The Ultimate Programmer? Hm... I wonder what your mind's alpha patterns look like...
5-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
5-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
5-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.
5-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a--
5-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=calm,Glad to see Chihiro back...
5-female_must_strip,target:coco,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:coco_sg1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:coco_sg1=calm,Style…? That’s it?
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_9s1=calm,I'm a scanner type, but hacking is something I do, yes.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
5-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.
5-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:2-8,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:gwen_stacys1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:gwen_stacys1=interested,Interesting. It’s like a decentralized personality…
5-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:2=interested,(<i>She has such a calming presence...</i>)
5-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:4=interested,Huh? Are you activating your berserk mode?
5-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:seductingplayer=frustrated,...Some of us at the table wouldn't mind attention either, Haru.
5-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Haru. Can I... rest my head against your chest after this?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
5-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,totalRounds:7=custom:Pod,~silent~
5-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
5-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.
5-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.
5-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_housewife1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_housewife2=clever,Why would anyone want to just sit around cleaning up other people’s messes… isn’t that what Operators are for?
5-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nat_doujins1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:nat_doujins1=interested,Hmm… her cortisol levels are rising…
5-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan entity: Raven.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can't believe you've outplayed me and are complaining about strategy. Maybe there's something to this magic thing.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
5-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
5-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
5-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
5-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
5-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
5-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
5-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
5-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,I’m not out yet, and this is just getting started.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,My visor and my eyes give me all the info I need for a come back. You might be getting started, but this is far from over, ~name~!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Enjoying the view, ~name~?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,I still have my visor, and nothing else to lose. So you better watch out!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,You’re not so far ahead that you can afford to get distracted, ~name~.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Keep going, ~name~. I’ve gotten the combat data I needed, this is just for me.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,This is it!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,That’s your last piece, right?
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=confident,Hard to fault android number crunching with a hand like this.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=clever,Close, ~name~. But not close enough.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=confident,Hard to fault android number crunching with a hand like this.
5-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Straight Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=clever,Close, ~name~. But not close enough.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,Oh, I haven’t forgotten about you, ~name~. You’ve been doing really well!
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=frustrated,I thought I’d be doing a little better than you, ~name~. I can admit that I’m wrong. You know, when I’m actually wrong.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=calm,Oh, I haven’t forgotten about you, ~name~. You were doing really well. Until this hand. Really, I bet you with this?
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0,hasHand:High Card=frustrated,I thought I’d be doing a little better than you, ~name~. I can admit that I’m wrong. But you seem more interested in playing bad hands...
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,Let’s get you caught up, ~name~.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,I’m feeling a twinge of something, ~name~. I don’t think it’s jealousy… But it feels kind of like that?
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=clever,Let’s get you caught up, ~name~. Maybe next hand'll be a bit more generous to you.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3,hasHand:High Card=interested,I’m feeling a twinge of something, ~name~. I don’t think it’s jealousy… hard to be too put out by winning against a hand like that.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,It’s been fun, ~name~, but you should know I don’t give up when I’m backed into a corner.
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,Hm. Do you fold under pressure, ~name~?
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6,hasHand:High Card=confident,It’s been fun, ~name~, but you should know I don’t give up when I’m backed into a corner. Look, I even won with <i>this</i> awful hand.

5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,This has been fun, ~name~. But what’s next is your...
5-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,Phew. Close match, ~name~.

-3-male_must_strip=calm,I don’t need tactical data to let me know that this is supposed to be fun. And ~name~’s doing a great job of making it so.
-3-male_must_strip=happy,~name~, this part never really gets old.
-3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
-3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
-3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.

-3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
-3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
-3-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?

-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
-3-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>

-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him again for these "Trion" particles.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,So... I have a prediction of my own. Is it your hat that's next?
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,So what <i>is</i> this Stand thing?
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=confident,I see. So you can stop time, briefly... fascinating.
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=confident,I don't need to be a Scanner to know you're reaching your limit. Was a little game too much for you to handle?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=clever,Hardly impossible, Kamina.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:1=frustrated,My model predicts that it'll be your wristwear.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, scan Kamina... again.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:3=happy,At least you're a humble loser.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,My model predicts your bandages... but after that...
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:5=interested,An arousing speech...
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:6=excited,You're really good at this inspiring speech stuff, Kamina!
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=interested,He's certainly handsome... but so placid. It's hard to get a read on him.
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:1=happy,Kira, what's your... uh, deal?
-3-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:7=clever,Looks like you're going to be "Biting Za Dusto."

-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, what do you mean his hair doesn't match his DNA?
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,You look like you're seen your share of combat. Do you prefer melee or ranged attacks?
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=frustrated,Hey, Ryuji, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I forget that humans are less interchangable than Androids... well, at least as far as repairs go.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=interested,I think I understand. Ryuji, you're some sort of forward operating fighter, right?
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
-3-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?
-3-female_human_must_strip=calm,Okay, ~name~, you’re going to take off...
-3-female_human_must_strip=interested,This is a lot harder to predict without the visor, but...
-3-female_human_must_strip=excited,Oh! ~name~ should be plenty exciting.

-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-akko:0,count-2b:0=confident,Hm... I wonder if this would play better as a co-op game. You, "Akko," and 2B and myself.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0,count-monster:3-=happy,Huh... now that you mention it, ~player~ and I are a bit out of place, huh?

-3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.

-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.

-3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.

-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
-3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?

-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…

-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
-3-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,totalRounds:7=custom:Pod,~silent~

-3-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.

-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can't believe you've outplayed me and are complaining about strategy. Maybe there's something to this magic thing.
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
-3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
-3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
-3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
-3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
-3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.

-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...

-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...

-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?

-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!

-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.

-2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
-2-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.

-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
-2-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
-2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
-2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,totalRounds:7=custom:Pod,~silent~
-2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
-2-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
-2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
-2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
-2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
-2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.

-2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
-2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
-2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan entity: Raven.
-2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
-2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
-2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can't believe you've outplayed me and are complaining about strategy. Maybe there's something to this magic thing.
-2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
-2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
-2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
-2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
-2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
-2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
-2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
-2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
-2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
-2-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
-2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
-2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
-2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
-2-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
-2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
-2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
-2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
-2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
-2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
-2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
-2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
-2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
-2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
-2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
-2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
-2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
-2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
-2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
-2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
-2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
-2-male_human_must_strip=interested,Pick something good, ~name~!
-2-male_human_must_strip=clever,Heh, I was hoping it’d be you, ~name~!
-2-male_human_must_strip=calm,Ah, this should be good!

-1-male_must_strip=excited,~name~! This’ll be good.
-1-male_must_strip=interested,~name~, you may have beaten me, but the game’s not over yet, huh?
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:prince=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
-1-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?

-1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
-1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
-1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
-1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
-1-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.

-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him again for these "Trion" particles.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=clever,I see how it is, offer it to the pretty girl, but not the tactical android.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=frustrated,I'm still confused about what this Trion body of yours entails. Pod nor my database can seem to figure it out.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:3=frustrated,I'm at a loss. Tell me what those Trion particles are, Jin!
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:4=interested,Okay. So your world is one that's constantly under siege by genetic-atemporal creatures... I deal with machines, myself.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=happy,It's a shame my process model didn't account for prescience.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=clever,Looks like the anomaly didn't favor you, Jin. Simulation's almost finished, isn't it?
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=confident,He must be a pretty bad gambler, then... wait a second...
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, adjust quark and muon scan parameters, focus on Jotaro. I don't want to lose this.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,So... I have a prediction of my own. Is it your hat that's next?
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,So what <i>is</i> this Stand thing?
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=confident,I see. So you can stop time, briefly... fascinating.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=confident,I don't need to be a Scanner to know you're reaching your limit. Was a little game too much for you to handle?
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=clever,Hardly impossible, Kamina.
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:1=frustrated,My model predicts that it'll be your wristwear.
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, scan Kamina... again.
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:3=happy,At least you're a humble loser.
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,My model predicts your bandages... but after that...
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:5=interested,An arousing speech...
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:6=excited,You're really good at this inspiring speech stuff, Kamina!
-1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:0=interested,He's certainly handsome... but so placid. It's hard to get a read on him.
-1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:1=happy,Kira, what's your... uh, deal?
-1-male_must_strip,target:kira,targetStage:7=clever,Looks like you're going to be "Biting Za Dusto."

-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, what do you mean his hair doesn't match his DNA?
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,You look like you're seen your share of combat. Do you prefer melee or ranged attacks?
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=frustrated,Hey, Ryuji, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I forget that humans are less interchangable than Androids... well, at least as far as repairs go.
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=interested,I think I understand. Ryuji, you're some sort of forward operating fighter, right?
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Okay, Ryuji! It's time to get a good scan of your musculature.
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=frustrated,Ryuji, hate to be a bother but... would you like me to take a look at your leg, or is it something sensitive?
-1-female_human_must_strip=interested,Hm. ~name~ doesn’t seem to have picked up the pace after my loss…

-1-female_human_must_strip=excited,That endorphin surge is unreal. ~name~, you should take off more so you can experience it!

-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0,count-monster:3-=happy,Huh... now that you mention it, ~player~ and I are a bit out of place, huh?
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
-1-female_must_strip,target:akko,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:akko_boy1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:akko_boy1=frustrated,I still don’t have a good grasp on all the optical illusions and rapid evolutions you’re doing, Akko…
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ann_takamaki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ann_standards1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:ann_standards1=interested,Ann’s an android?
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=interested,The Ultimate Programmer? Hm... I wonder what your mind's alpha patterns look like...
-1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,So... I suppose you see this game as a growth, or personal challenge?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,If you want a distraction, we could talk about hacking and programming?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=frustrated,I understand you're uncomfortable, but why compete if you didn't plan for a loss? Make it count.
-1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, run a--
-1-female_must_strip,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=calm,Glad to see Chihiro back...
-1-female_must_strip,target:coco,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:coco_sg1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:coco_sg1=calm,Style…? That’s it?
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_9s1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_9s1=calm,I'm a scanner type, but hacking is something I do, yes.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:futaba_cogpsi1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:futaba_cogpsi1=interested,Huh. I think some of the YorHa project’s android programming is based on that sort of stuff…
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
-1-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.
-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:2-8,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:gwen_stacys1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:gwen_stacys1=interested,Interesting. It’s like a decentralized personality…
-1-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:2=interested,(<i>She has such a calming presence...</i>)
-1-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:4=interested,Huh? Are you activating your berserk mode?
-1-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:seductingplayer=frustrated,...Some of us at the table wouldn't mind attention either, Haru.
-1-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:6=frustrated,...Haru. Can I... rest my head against your chest after this?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,So, Lotte, you're some sort of... A.I. technician?
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:2=confident,It's just a simulation, Lotte. You should be prepared for everything! It's like one of those human visual game things.
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:3=interested,Oh? No bodysuit under your dress? I guess you aren't an android after all...
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte, your body language suggests you're kind of happy to get out of your shirt. Is it that uncomfortable?
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5=interested,Your "freckles" have such an appealing pattern. I'd even call them cute!
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WritingRant1,targetNotSaidMarker:WritingRantLoss,targetSayingMarker:WritingRantLoss=clever,Maybe you should focus on the cards and not on the state of your art, Lotte.
-1-female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:6=custom:Pod,Lotte, my Pod is reporting you're quite... aroused.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=interested,Mahiru, I don't think I've seen a Devola or Popola with a Pod before...
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're really serious about not counting your Pod, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her...? She seems... near-human.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=clever,Not bad, Mavis. You could be a YorHa soldier... well, you have a little too much personality, I think.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,I'm... not sure what to predict you'll take off next. Your... leggings, I suppose?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hmm... <i>Pod</i> restructure the model, and watch closely...
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:4=interested,Oh... you're kind of... insular?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:5=happy,I don't think you're dumb, Mavis, but... I do think you should own your attempts at distraction.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,totalRounds:7=custom:Pod,~silent~
-1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
-1-female_must_strip,target:megumin,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:megu_loli1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:megu_loli1=frustrated,Isn’t it kind of in bad form to essentially broadcast controversial areas of the game?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
-1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
-1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
-1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, enact Resolve protocol.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_housewife1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_housewife2=clever,Why would anyone want to just sit around cleaning up other people’s messes… isn’t that what Operators are for?
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nat_doujins1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:nat_doujins1=interested,Hmm… her cortisol levels are rising…
-1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
-1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
-1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan entity: Raven.
-1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,Raven, is that belt some sort of suspension device? How are you floating?
-1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,Hm. You don't really seem thrilled to be here. <i>Pod</i>, scan Raven...
-1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can't believe you've outplayed me and are complaining about strategy. Maybe there's something to this magic thing.
-1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:4=interested,Well, I think we already saw the best part...
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=interested,Remilia, this game's supposed to do things attractive to an audience, yes? Do you wager if I taught my Pod to remove my clothing...?
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm what I'm reading...? Is her pulse really so calm... as to be nonexistent?
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, do a chemical decomposition analysis on Remilia's drink...
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:4=rage,I'm ready for you! Let's see what you've got, Remilia! No more time manipulation. Let's see <i>you</i> try something!
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:5=happy,If you were an android with a Pod, you could easily outmaneuver those knives. Let's see if "Scarlet Lady" measures up.
-1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
-1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
-1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm energy signature on Ryuko's clothing...
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can't believe you're sitting on technology that converts willpower into physical energy, and you're so non-chalant about it.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod!</i> Energy spike inbound, prepare defensive measures!
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=interested,Is it possible for you to dissemble your combat gear?
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=interested,I usually give verbal commands to my Pod. It seems you have some kind of a neural link...
-1-female_must_strip,target:sabrina,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:brina_outfit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:brina_outfit1=calm,She seems very human to me. Lo-tech, maybe.
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3-6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<6,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sakura_bf1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sakura_bf1=clever,I guess that human phrase “Til Death Do Us Part” has a loophole as far as Sakura’s concerned.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=interested,Sayaka, what's this Witch you're talking about?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=happy,So your belly button gem... it <i>is</i> giving off tons of energy...
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=frustrated,So, this Witch... is it like a psychic entity? How would you describe it?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,I'm curious to see what that looks like for you!
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=happy,Well, we've seen your "panties" when you took off your stockings... so, at least we know you have two more turns after this.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=interested,Is it hard to hold the cards like that, Sayaka?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=happy,Well, it's been a little more fun or arousing than deadly combat, right, Sayaka?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill1=frustrated,Oh! I think I saw someone named Jill. Purple hair, white apron? I mistook her for a YorHa operative!
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=8,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo1=calm,Mixing things for dramatic effects… sounds like chip loadouts and Pod commands to me.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=happy,Sheena, how are you doing those suspension tricks with the cards?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm... you must be from another Project... Your clothing is far too bright to be from YorHa.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,You've mentioned some support... spirits? Summons? Do those act like your Pod?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=frustrated,She's using a Pod command! Prepare for countermeasures!
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:5=happy,Why... did you forget underwear? Are your tights that comfortable?
-1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
-1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, build a psychological profile on Sola...
-1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:1=interested,Sola, you're a human, right? My Pod's analysis is showing strange ion and gluon manipulation near you...
-1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:2=clever,Counting two items as one? Are you in a hurry to show off your form, Sola?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:3=interested,Why would those be shameful? They look very attractive, to me, anyway.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:4=frustrated,You shouldn't play if you don't plan to risk losing.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sola,targetStage:5=confident,Sola, why didn't you remove your hat?
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
-1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
-1-male_human_must_strip=clever,Hm. ~name~, if you appreciated the show, you should take off something big, right?
-1-male_human_must_strip=excited,~name~! This’ll be good.
-1-male_human_must_strip=interested,~name~, you may have beaten me, but the game’s not over yet, huh?
-1-male_human_must_strip,hasHand:Flush,saidMarker:great_hands<3,priority:90,marker:great_hands=happy,Interesting, ~name~, but you lost when I had a really good hand.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_accessory=happy,This is kinda fun, playing without the algorithm.
male_removed_accessory=frustrated,Okay, my Pod should’ve rebooted right now.
female_removing_accessory=calm,Well, I suppose your ~clothing~ will be fine while Pod reboots.
female_removed_accessory=interested,I’m not used to operating without uh… Some insight.

0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,A reasonable start. Nothing too personal, nothing too covering. Good play, ~name~!
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm. That’s I figured you’d ante your ~clothing~, ~name~.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,Good pacing, ~name~. I think. You’re trying to take a loss, but not show too much yet, right?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,<i>Pod</i>, add his ~clothing~ into the behavior algorithm. No, not the xenomapped ligase… The <i>other</i> XML.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=clever,Saving a little tease for the ladies, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=confident,Wow, you’ve really been hanging on to that, huh, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6,totalMales:5=clever,Saving a little tease for the ladies, ~name~? Uh, if there were any here. Kinda weird that it’s all guys…
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=happy,You came fully armored… You’re awful at this, ~name~.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,And without a scratch on me.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=clever,You're doing a great job so far. Given our relative performance.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,Yeah, yeah. Let’s keep going.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,Not bad, ~name~. Don’t overthink it.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,You’re falling behind, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=calm,9S to Operator 21O to report status. ~name~: Two losses, 9S: 0.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,A game like this is no fun if you don’t take it seriously, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,I’d probably save my visor for last. Though I don’t think your ~clothing~ is a real tactical advantage, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Nothing left to lose now, ~name~. May as well fold.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=interested,Now that I can see all of you, I’m honestly amazed. You saved an accessory for last, but I haven’t lost at all yet. You’re weird, ~name~.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,~Clothing~? That’s a reasonable start.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, starting small, ~name~. For a first play, that seems to fit the model.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=calm,It’s still early, so your ~clothing~ seems like a fine choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,~name~’s slowing it down a little bit. If I were losing, I might consider that.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,Usually androids in the Bunker try out Old Earth accessories, but they’re usually the first thing that they remove when getting to work. To be fair, you haven’t really started working, ~name~.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=rage,So not only are you playing poorly, but you’re not going to remove bigger pieces?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,That must be important to you, to save it even after everything, and while you’re doing so badly...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=calm,Well, I can’t really complain about holdout apparel, given that you’ve somehow lost eight times before I even lost once.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,I’m only a little ahead of you now, ~name~. Let’s see what you’ve got!
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,I wonder if this is going to shape up your strategy moving forward. I’m going to guess no, though.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,It’s hard to play against a Scanner type.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,It has to be pretty hard to lose so many times without having gotten a single item off of someone, so it’s okay to try and save some dignity.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,Oh, come on. You just took off your ~clothing~, and this late in the game. <i>Pod</i>, let me get started on my report. This is going nowhere.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=calm,Huh, I see. So when a male holds onto an item, it’s mostly because they were trying to get naked. But with females, it’s supposed to be for display.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,To be honest, while you weren’t great competition, I’m enjoying looking at all of you. Uh, you know. Androids can appreciate this kind of too.

1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,~name~’s adapting my tactics. Interesting.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=clever,It’s a start, at least.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,Okay, so he doesn’t want to get to the good parts yet. Not a bad strategy.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,You know, I don’t really mind the small stuff, ~name~. Let’s keep going, though.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,I’m kind of amazed you held onto that.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=interested,I wonder if 21O would like it if I wore something like that…
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=frustrated,I could still see you wearing that but I’d expected it to just stay on as you lost…
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,I expected I’d like this more if a female model had held onto their ~clothing~ even after exposing everything else…
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=clever,You're doing a great job so far. Given our relative performance.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,There we go. Now we’re even, but don’t think I’m going to go easy on you.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,I hope you enjoyed being ahead while you had the chance.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,Even for a Scanner model, I must be pretty good at this.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,Nothing to report here.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=clever,Yeah, yeah. Get on with it.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=rage,Are you just trying to mock me?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=clever,That was an interesting idea, holding onto that for last.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=calm,I don’t really have a lot of sentimental items. It’s hard to account for emotionality, I suppose.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,~Clothing~. That’s a fair opening move. Kind of derivative, though…
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like we’re going to be even now, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,Ah, ~clothing~. You’re still on the small stuff too, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,You’re still doing pretty well, ~name~!
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Wait, you’re <i>still</i> holding onto something like that?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=interested,Wouldn’t it make more sense to have taken that off earlier, ~name~? Why did you keep it?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Huh. I think there’s something in my records about this. Are you doing a striptease, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=frustrated,This doesn’t make a lot of tactical sense but it’s definitely doing something for me…
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,We’re tied for now, ~name~. But that’ll change soon.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=confident,I know it took a little bit to warm up, but now you’ll see what a top of the line YorHa scanner model can do.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,What a pain. I’m not going to just let you win, but do you really have to have so many diversions?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,So that’s going to be your last accessory, right? The rest of the stuff doesn’t count, does it?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,If I were in your shoes, or uh, lack thereof, I’d try and delay until I got some help too.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=interested,You held onto your ~clothing~ for that long, but you’re still so exposed... <i>Pod</i>, adjust depth of field on ~name~, I don’t want her to catch me off guard.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,That’s that, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=clever,Saving your ~clothing~ for last seems like a striptease to me.


#lost boots
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,That’s a reasonably smart start.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,I wish you’d started with something bigger.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,You know, at this point, shouldn’t you be running out of accessories, ~name~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,Yeah, yeah.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=interested,I wonder if you’re taking it easy on me.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=rage,What kind of nonsense is this?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:8=frustrated,That has to have some sort of sentimental value to you for you to have brought it and kept it for so long.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,I’ve heard of stripteases, but isn’t hat something women are supposed to do?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=clever,You're doing a great job so far. Given our relative performance.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,Hopefully that’ll be the first of many.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=frustrated,Okay, not a bad first choice, but a little
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=happy,Why’d you keep that ~clothing~ around for so long anyway? Sentimental value?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,Now that you’re out of trinkets, ~name~, let’s see if you can’t form up a better defense.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,You’re worse than 2B at cards. She always just says the game is stupid. I’ve lost nothing and you’re… This is odd.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,I’ve seen Machine Lifeforms with more sense than you.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Well, it seemed… Cool while you had it, ~name~.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=interested,It seems to be working on me when you do it, ~name~.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?

2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, the point of this game was to get encounter data… I’m just <i>vexed</i> that this is your first play.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=confident,I’m impressed, ~name~. You’re generating a lot of good metrics, and putting up a great challenge!
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,You’re no 2B, but we’d make a pretty good team, ~name~.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,We’re neck and neck, and following a similar order… Do you also have something big next, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=clever,I wonder if some sudden urge came over you to keep your ~clothing~ on… It’s not great tactical sense, but it is confusing… <i>Pod</i>, add this play to the Misdirection Tactics file.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Hm. Did you forget you had your ~clothing~, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=rage,Oh come on, if you’re going to throw the game, don’t be insulting, ~name~.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,Is this because I took my boots off instead of my coat? <i>Whoosh</i> my model did not account for forgetfulness.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,Something bigger would be nice, but I can hardly blame you for that first play.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,Gloves <i>and</i> boots for <i>~clothing~</i>. That seems fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,I mean, we’re performing at approximately the same level. It’s a compliment, trust me.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,Though I <i>am</i> interested in whatever you have next.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=clever,Huh. Okay then. At least we can enjoy the view?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,It happens to the best of us. Sometimes, I forget to take my visor off before I sleep, to be honest.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=calm,Well, you look cute, ~name~. Not that you didn’t before...
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=frustrated,Yeah, yeah. Very clever. Let’s keep on.


#lost coat
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Starting small?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=happy,Well, I’m far from out myself… Making it a challenge?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,I wonder if I could’ve brought Cruel Oath and treated it as an accessory.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,That’s not exactly sending shockwaves my way.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Hm. <i>Pod</i>, make note of stalling tactics.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=confident,Well, ~name~, saving your small stuff for last is… Maybe not the worst idea.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,So you saved your ~clothing~ for the very end of the game?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,I think maybe I’ll hold onto my visor for last, just to try it out.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=clever,You're doing a great job so far. Given our relative performance.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,At least you didn’t remove a limb, I’ve seen machine lifeforms try to emulate this game and… It has odd results.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=confident,If that’s your first move, ~name~, I think we’re in for a long game.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,Keep playing like that, ~name~, and I don’t even need predictive data to win.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=happy,This is close, ~name~. I’m going to have to refactor your risk index…
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=rage,I know I’m not that far behind you, but did you really need to hold onto something like that for so long?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,Yeah, yeah. Let’s keep going to the good stuff.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,Hm. You look <i>much</i> better without that.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=confident,You’re easy on the eyes, ~name~. Under the visor and all.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?

3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.

3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Pod</i>, does the algorithm account for-- Oh, it does account for my own state of undress.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,That’s… A play you can make.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hm. <i>Pod,</i> can you stream something more interesting to my visor? There’ve been better plays already.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your ~clothing~’s quite cute, but I think a nice ribbon works just as well.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=happy,Well, it’s a bit late in the game, but at least you’re trying, ~name~.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Hm. I think most people would’ve rather you taken something off something bigger.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,Are you checking out my chest, ~name~?
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,Did you hold onto that because… I’m this exposed? To make a point? Or to stand with me?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,It would’ve been nice to see more, but I guess I’ll just have to keep up the play.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm. Smart first play, but uh, maybe I should’ve played a little better if that’s all you’re taking off.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=happy,<i>Pod</i>, make a note that ~name~’s playing well. Let’s implement some of her strategy next play.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=excited,<i>Pod</i>, ~name~’s score is close to mine, but she came with more countermeasures. Make a note to bring more next time.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=interested,Holding onto your ~clothing~ this late, ~name~? Huh. I guess it buys you time, at least.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,Oh, I see. ~name~ held onto her ~clothing~ as a backup measure. Not really what I wanted to see about now, but it’s good tactical sense.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Well, now we can see all of you, ~name~. Well, all but one part...
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,It’s strange, but I’m actually finding the appeal of saving your ~clothing~ for last. It adds… Something extra.


#lost shorts
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,Well, you <i>are</i> winning. Maybe there’s a lesson here rather than something to be frustrated about.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=clever,Even though I’m down to two layers, you had something so small for your first play? You’re really into winning, ~name~.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,Don’t count me out just yet, ~name~.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,Hm. Your ~clothing~ is a start, I suppose.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=happy,Here we go, ~name~.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,Statistically, this <i>should</i> be your last extra piece.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Huh, I guess saving an accessory for last means it can be a distraction… Or a final hidden play.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=frustrated,I’ve seen you wearing your ~clothing~, but I suppose I was just expected you to keep it on...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Mind drawing some more off of me? I'm kind of at my limit here...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,Would you mind helping me regulate my model after this?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm. I wish I’d thought of that. I guess humans just have a good grasp on this kind of thing.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,Even though you’ve still got your weakest pieces, I still think we’ll see more from you before this is over.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=calm,Yeah yeah, let’s keep going. I’m not trying to rush, just want to keep playing.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,Getting right down to it, ~name~.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=clever,I think your ~clothing~ was a good play for this late in the game, from a tactical perspective. I think. I can’t always be right.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Well, no more last second plays, ~name~.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=confident,I like seeing all of you, ~name~. It’s… Very compelling.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,All things considered, this could be worse.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,I should've played better if all ~name~ has to remove is...That.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,I can respect a better player, but part of me wishes there was more to see.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your ~clothing~ isn't a bad choice at all. Here's hoping it's the first of many!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=happy,For the Glory of Mankind is supposed to be our motto in YorHa.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,My exocortex is on fire right now. Why am I feeling all these weird emotions?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Wow, for some reason having your ~clothing~ last is really quite pleasing!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=happy,It’s contrary to the expected order, but it's very exciting that you've kept your ~clothing~ on, even if you're exposing your other primary vulnerabilities.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=confident,It’s a start. And a start is all I need.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,Well, good to see you get into it, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. I never really understood why such accessories were so popular among the female androids...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,Well, one countermeasure down.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=interested,It seems almost rude to watch you scrounge for spare parts when I'm like this.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,Hm. I wonder if 21O would like something like that… Or maybe 2B...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=interested,Well, this has been enjoyable, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,So, this is what you look like in full behind all the countermeasures, with no augmentation? It’s… very striking!


#lost boxers
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Not what I’d have liked you to pick, but you’re the one that’s winning...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=clever,Are you just trying to show off, ~name~? Your ~clothing~ doesn’t show much.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your ~clothing~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,You’re still in the early stages, ~name~, so it follows trend data that you’d still have countermeasures like your ~clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=excited,Hm. A late stage play with your ~clothing~...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=confident,Your ~clothing~ isn’t your first and it’s not going to be your last, ~name~!
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Most sensible players give up their ~clothing~ and such first, ~name~.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,That ~clothing~’s caught my attention as much as… Well, the rest of you, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Mind drawing some more off of me? I'm kind of at my limit here...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=rage,Argh, I hate to lose. I’m supposed to be a shining example of a YorHa Scanner, and you’re overwhelming me so readily, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,I hope most of your processing power was reserved for your ~clothing~, ~name~, and we can start seeing bigger losses.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=calm,I guess there’s something to be said about playing accessories early.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=excited,Well, one more thing down. I hope it isn’t the last.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,I’m enjoying the look, ~name~!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,Let’s keep going. No need to “yeah yeah” you when you’re positioned like you are. In the game, I mean.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=confident,I’m glad you’re keeping this so interesting!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Though, I’m really liking this whole “completely unarmored” look.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=frustrated,I can’t believe you’re so far ahead, ~name~. Your first loss, and an accessory?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=rage,What? ~name~? Were you running some kind of stealth program? I can’t believe you’ve only lost one item.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Okay, that’s an early play.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,Well, one more down, at least.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=clever,Your ~clothing~? Oh, come on, ~name~, don’t just drag this out!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,Well, it’s not that your ~clothing~ isn’t impressive…
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,You really brought me around on saving something small like your ~clothing~ for last.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,So, Pod finally sent the old information, this is what you’d call a “strip tease,” right, ~name~?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,Your ~clothing~ was… A little impressive, considering that you’re so far ahead.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,You’re really impressive, ~name~, even if that was a first loss.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,I don’t suppose you’d be willing to uh, take off more?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,I’m certainly less dressed, but if all you’re taking off is ~clothing~, can you really say you’re better dressed?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=excited,It’s just that you’re so distinct.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=excited,The rest of you just stands out so much more!
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Anyway, it has… Definitely had a profound effect on my model moving forward.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,I mean, I’m doing that with my visor, kind of. It just… Uh, happens to be more functional.

-3-male_removing_accessory=clever,Your ~clothing~? That’s a pretty common accessory, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory=calm,Oh, ~clothing~. It’s not big, if you want help.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
-3-male_removed_accessory=happy,Well, you lost your ~clothing~, but I have a feeling the frustration people are experiencing will pass soon.
-3-male_removed_accessory=confident,This has definitely been a fun experience.
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=frustrated,...Mind drawing some more off of me? I'm kind of at my limit here...
-3-female_removing_accessory=interested,Her ~clothing~? Nice choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory=happy,Something small? Yeah, yeah. It’s still cute though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.

-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
-3-female_removed_accessory=confident,Well, fair’s fair. I’m excited to see just a <i>bit</i> more of you.
-3-female_removed_accessory=clever,So isn’t that an Old World custom, where someone else takes off small bits of ~name~’s clothing with their teeth? I… Could be persuaded.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.

-2-male_removing_accessory=interested,Well, it’s one step closer to getting you fully exposed, ~name~.
-2-male_removing_accessory=confident,Oh, your ~clothing~? Well, I’m sure you can be creative with how it comes off...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!

-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!

-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
-2-male_removed_accessory=confident,You seem a bit lost, ~name~. Here’s a tip: Big stuff, then follow my lead.
-2-male_removed_accessory=happy,Okay, what’s next, ~name~?
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=frustrated,A shame you couldn't have drawn the game out a little more for me.
-2-female_removing_accessory=calm,Y-yeah, yeah.
-2-female_removing_accessory=frustrated,I could use a bit more support than your ~clothing~, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested,2B’s better at taking care of small stuff… Hacking tends to be a one-size approach.
-2-female_removed_accessory=confident,Something bigger’s next, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.

-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.

-1-male_removing_accessory=happy,~Clothing~ from ~name~? Hmm.
-1-male_removing_accessory=clever,I bet you’ll be wanting that back, right? I wouldn’t mind a little souvenir, ~name~.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=confident,I bet those goggles aren't as useful as my visor, Jin... Hm... I wonder what the anomaly was?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=rage,My visor can track all sorts of things. Like the several of you manipulating time. That's not going to be enough tonight!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=frustrated,Powering a weapon with life force? That doesn't make any sense. There has to be some sort of... sub-molecular particle being used to manipulate physical space.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod,</i> scan him for temporal distortion.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, confirm reading of a second source of temporal distortion!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... just... modified brain waves...? Could this be some sort of highly developed psionic power...?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,Who the hell is he? <i>Pod</i> scan him.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,You're really persistent! You almost make me believe you can out-do fate!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan him again?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Not a lot to get excited about...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=confident,I'm very much a "leave no soldier behind" Android. Do you want me to help you with those?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=clever,Everything about you is loud and bright, and you have a built-in vulnerability. I bet you're used to drawing fire off your allies, right?
-1-male_removed_accessory=happy,Well, it’s not much but it’s something to cover up with, anyway.
-1-male_removed_accessory=frustrated,Why’d you bring your ~clothing~ to a simulation like this anyway? Just to pad your countermeasures?
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=interested,His eyes are like mine, but I wonder what powers of time humans can possess?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan "Fujin" for quarks and gluons. Let's see what Jin's weapon is made of. Jin too, while we're at it.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=frustrated,How did you do that? Even hypercogitation can't keep up with that speed. How are you manipulating time itself, Jotaro?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:remilia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:Pod,I see... Remilia and Jotaro must be competing over their temporal abilities...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=calm,Humans are incredible! If only YorHa could've used their time-stopping abilities, we wouldn't have needed more than one or two Machine Wars...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=confident,Interesting. You're certainly bombastic, at least.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3=confident,Let's see how long you can keep it up, Kamina.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm... Very calm, very disinterested in drawing attention to himself...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=calm,...You're not very interesting, are you, Kira?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,Hm... <i>Pod</i>, can you correlate his gamma waves to that response...? He seems so touchy about getting close with another male.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=frustrated,A shame you couldn't have drawn the game out a little more for me.
-1-female_removing_accessory=happy,Well, it’s small, but if it’s anything like a blackbox or machine core, big things can come in small devices.
-1-female_removing_accessory=confident,I’m <i>really</i> impressed you’ve managed to keep your ~clothing~ for this long, ~name~!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.

-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan Chihiro for her brainwaves...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=frustrated,Are you trying to iterate on your... tracing methods?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=happy,You're a human engineer, right? I owe my creation to people like you, but what sorts of scripts and programs do you like to generate?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=excited,And ~player~, of course.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:Singing=happy,I've noticed you murming to various objects. I wouldn't have taken you as a Scanner-class android. You know, working with device intelligences?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Singing=happy,Oh, those spirits you're talking about. They're just the hard-wired intelligences in the object, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,They're... kind of all-rounder Android models. They have hair like yours, but tend to avoid using support units...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=interested,Your hormones are all over the place, Mahiru.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:0=interested,Your gloves are fine, but what <i>are</i> you? An android? A human... something else?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, are you floating? Do you have anti-grav functionality?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Sorry, Monika, did you overshoot your target a little there?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=frustrated,C'mon. There has to be more to it than <i>that</i>.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:uravity,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Hm. Uravity's very perceptive, isn't she?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Wait a minute-- <i>Pod</i>, check her for sleight of hand, or if she's the source of the anomaly!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,saidMarker:temporal_anamoly,marker:temporal_anamoly=custom:Pod,Yet another person manipulating time...? This has to be part of the simulation's appeal...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=confident,Forgive me for ignoring your friend... but your sailor uniform is giving off unusual power signatures...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=frustrated,Hey! Watch for friendly fire!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=happy,Interesting. So you've never... tried to remove your outfit without a threat present?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:0=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I'm not sure if she's a human or an android...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,marker:silhouette=frustrated,YorHa units aren't permitted in-combat emotions... or nice flowing...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=interested,Hm... Nervous, excited... <i>vengeful</i>?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=clever,Are you one of those... mages?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested,Hm. I can think of a few battle models who’d look good in ~clothing~ like ~name~’s.
-1-female_removed_accessory=clever,~Clothing~’s off to you, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:1=interested,...Huh. Well, I suppose I can keep this a surprise. Between hackers.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:2=calm,Don't worry, Chihiro. We're all uh... marginally similar under our coats.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=interested,Don't give up, Chihiro. Most scanners aren't combat models, but I learned how to do it!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword,targetSayingMarker:9ssparring=interested,Hm... I know some of the old A-series models liked the serrated weaponry. I <i>should</i> be able to put up a good fight.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. A wand...? Is that some sort of particle manipulator?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=calm,Hm... your oxytocin level begs to differ, Lotte.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan her? I think she really believes that she's doing magic. I should try to fix her personality core up a bit... Lotte, would you mind some manual attention? It's easier to do some tactile adjustments.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=calm,They <i>do</i> tend to walk everywhere... Hm... I can't tell if you're lying or the confusion is just some sort of defensive response...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=clever,I can't tell if you're excited or startled. But I don't think you can either.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=happy,I admire your enthusiasm, at least.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:2=interested,There's... something quite appealing about watching you take off those shoes mid-air...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=calm,You might be able to mess with my interface, but I'm the better hacker.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=clever,I see. So it seems that clothes here just sort of disappear into the ether... Kinda weird, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,What?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=interested,Where did you find that material? What is it?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:ryuko_mako2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:ryuko_mako3=interested,She's remarkably durable, your companion.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,id:5=interested,Even an android removes his clothing for maintenance. I'm surprised you've never checked it out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,I have to say, I enjoy lace.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mulan=interested,Is Mulan a princess of some sort, Sayaka?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity=clever,Swords? Huh. It seems like R040: Blade. Fascinating.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're building a model too... what's your model, Sheena? Are you another Scanner?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=interested,Well, your sash. Also, no visor... hm... Maybe you are human...?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=excited,It'll be great to see how she adapts to the flow of battle. Let's test our wits, Sola!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=confident,...I'm not fully sure I believe you. Can you show me some of this "magic?" There's strange stuff tonight, but...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.

male_removing_minor=confident,I’m a bit lost without a reset...
male_removed_minor=excited,What… Is going on?
female_removing_minor=happy,My context-sensitive responses seem… Not super useful at present.
female_removed_minor=calm,Well, that was a fairly impressive ~clothing~.


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=confident,Not a bad first choice. Everyone’s endorphins are rising.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=excited,Your ~clothing~? Bold choice.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Okay, so first you lost your… Hmm… And now you’re taking off your ~clothing~... <i>Pod</i>, add this to the algorithm.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,Oh! That’s not bad.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=calm,Scanner types are great at lots of stuff. But my specialty is combat data. You’re not putting up much of a fight, ~name~.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,If you really want to win, ~name~, you’re going to have to be less predictable.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=clever,This is it, isn’t it? Everything’s out there already, but I’m sure you had a reason to save your ~clothing~ for last.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=confident,I think getting almost naked and saving your ~clothing~ for last was a neat trick, but distracting the group with everything else clearly didn’t work. I’m still at full strength.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=happy,Looks like I’ve got the advantage here, ~name~.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Just the opening act. No need to pretend like this is the end just yet.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Everything that lives is designed to end. Hopefully your loss streak is the same.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,I was expecting <i>some</i> challenge here. Is this as complicated as it gets?
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=clever,That’s not a bad piece to give up
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=confident,I’m not going to hack into your loadout, ~name~. But if I were you, I’d add some Reset chips to your stack next game.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=calm,You didn’t even get me to lose once, ~name~. I’m a little uncomfortable with not understanding why.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
0-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
0-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
0-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
0-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
0-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
0-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
0-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
0-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
0-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
0-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
0-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! That’s bigger than I expected.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=excited,~name~ is taking off her ~clothing~? First? Huh!
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,That isn’t a bad choice for early, but you’re still a little behind, ~name~.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,I’m not ahead by a huge margin, but it’s good to see you’re keeping with the spirit of the game, ~name~. This is great data.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,That’s pretty predictable given how much you’ve already lost.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,Ah, hold on, ~name~! My visor tracking desynced for a second. I need to observe this carefully. I hate it when stuff gets fragmented.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=interested,Huh. I’d have expected either something bigger or smaller, but considering you’re already basically naked...
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,What a strange last item, ~name~... You’re really making me question what exactly your goals here today were…
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
0-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
0-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
0-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
0-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,Interesting first choice!
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=happy,I think your ~clothing~ was a good initial ante, especially when we’re so close in score. I’m happy to see where this goes, ~name~.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,Yeah, yeah. Okay, what’s next?
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,You keep losing, ~name~. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,Okay, so you’re almost done now. I’m surprised you waited this long to remove that.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=confident,We’re really getting down to it. Well, <i>you’re</i> really getting down to it.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=frustrated,It’s nice to see you naked and to be winning and all, but you’re really throwing a wrench in my predictive model.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,Well, I’m not quite sure why you showed off your important stuff but saved that for last. But I suppose if you don’t have fun, there’s not a lot of good in doing it, right?


#lost gloves
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
1-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
1-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
1-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
1-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod</i> activate mid-range tactics for ~name~’s minor clothing.
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. Usually you’d take off something bigger as a first strike tactic, or something smaller to be defensive, right?
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,~name~’s taking off his ~clothing~. That’s a little distracting, but it’s still early for both of us.
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Even though you’re losing, ~name~, keep up your pace. Even if you can’t beat me, I’m sure we can all have some fun together.
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=excited,One more down, ~name~. You’re not hiding any more!
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. Yeah, yeah. Small, but not too small. You’re really getting low on reserves, ~name~.
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,I can clearly see that’s all you have left… But shouldn’t you have taken your ~clothing~ off earlier in the game?
1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=rage,~clothing~? That doesn’t make any sense… Why was that your last piece?
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
1-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>

1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=confident,We may have lost the same number of times, ~name~, but you’re showing more skin. So that means you’re <i>losing</i>.
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,<i>Pod,</i> account for this behavior moving forward. ~name~’s a bit of a wild card.
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=happy,A typical early play. His ~clothing~... That looked good on him!
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Not a bad choice, ~name~, but I can’t wait to see what you’re going to part with next.
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=confident,Your ~clothing~ might not be impressive, ~name~, but considered with everything else you’ve lost…
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=calm,This is kind of boring if you’re going to only take one piece off me for every five or so I take from you. The model basically says you’re done for, ~name~.
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=interested,I have to say, for losing my gloves, I got to see ~name~ lose eight full items of clothing, and have a strange final choice. Not bad!
1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, whatever your reasons were, it’s almost over for you, ~name~.
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
1-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
1-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
1-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
1-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,That seems a fair way to tie it up.
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=excited,Okay. Not a huge overextension, but also not something trivial. I see what you’re doing, ~name~.
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,<i>This</i> was worth the scouting efforts.
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Hm.
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=calm,My hands are a little cold. I bet ~name~ wishes she had internal temperature regulation though
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,~name~’s really running out of options.
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=interested,You’re showing off your breasts and vagina, ~name~, why’re you still wearing your ~clothing~?
1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=rage,You saved your <i>~clothing~</i> for last? What?
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
1-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
1-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
1-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
1-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
1-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,<i>Pod</i>, update combat data. Now that ~name~’s lost something too, we should have a better idea on how to take her down.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=confident,Gloves for ~clothing~ seems pretty reasonable, ~name~. I mean, I’ve only started gathering encounter data, so I hope you don’t mind if I keep on beating you.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,Alright, ~name~, looks like you’re following the expected trends. I guess I can relax and just enjoy this, if you keep playing like this.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,Yeah yeah, data data data, adherence to model. Uh, sorry, <i>~name~</i>, I was feeding verbal commands to my Pod.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,Huh. I’m glad I got this far for only my gloves, but this is getting boring.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=excited,Well, you’re definitely showing a lot of skin. Kinda cute, even if your performance ratio isn’t the greatest! Uh, I mean-- Let me start over?
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Yeah, yeah, very creative. A ~clothing~ after showing off the most responsive bits of your form. I’ll try not to stare. Well, not too much.
1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,Well, that’s that. 8 to 1 isn’t bad, and I even gathered some new strategies. Oh, <i>hey</i>! The Operators say they’ll employ some of your choices next time the Bunker does a game night, so good work, ~name~!

2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, that seems like a reasonable start.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Yeah, yeah. Catch up, will you?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,Looks like we’re finally working our way through ~name~’s bigger objects. More to go, though.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,That’s a pretty big series of losses, ~name~.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,Wrapping things up, huh, ~name~?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,<i>Pod</i>, take a study of that item. I want to make a heuristic for future encounters of this type.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,Just ~clothing~?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=confident,I knew you were playing poorly, but saving something like your ~clothing~ for last?
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Yeah, yeah. Let’s see what else you’ve got.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,Smaller than I’d have liked, but a reasonable first play.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=confident,Even a Scanner type can appreciate a good contest.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,9S to Bunker. ~name~ has removed a minor countermeasure after I’ve removed my gloves and boots.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=calm,This is going to take a while. At least you’re making good progress.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,Okay, ~name~, what’s left?
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=frustrated,I’m still not understanding why some people save their minor clothing until the very last.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=excited,Well, that’s just about it for you, ~name~. Now that you’re fully exposed, are you going to fight back, or fold?
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
2-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
2-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
2-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
2-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
2-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,That’s a weird first choice, but it’s weirder that I’m losing...
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. You’re following my lead, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,~Clothing~? Huh. That definitely makes me feel better about these projections…
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Not exactly breaking the mold with your ~clothing~.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,<i>Pod</i>, make note that ~name~’s strategy is typical. And a losing one.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,It’s not as big as I’d like-- Uh, as big as generates useful data.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=confident,~silent~
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,Well, you’ve been showing off everything else, so despite getting me down to my coat, your efforts to sabotage my analysis hasn’t worked...
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
2-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
2-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
2-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Not too out there, so let’s see what next.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=confident,It’s still early. Plenty of time for a comeback.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,Well, that’s pretty typical for uh, how both of us are doing.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Not exciting, but ~name~’s definitely making it easy to sit back and enjoy this instead of working all the time.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,Almost out, ~name~. This has been fun!
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,Hmm. Not what I’d have picked but you’re not diverging from how you’re supposed to be playing…
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:7=happy,Okay, that was an interesting final choice, ~name~. But I’ve got my doubts you’ll be coming back after that.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:7=calm,Well, that was strange you saved something minor like your ~clothing~ for very last… But I have a hunch you aren’t disliking the attention now.


#lost coat
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
3-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
3-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
3-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
3-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
3-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
3-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
3-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,A conservative first play, considering I’m already halfway naked...
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. What kind of tactical benefit does your ~clothing~ provide, ~name~?
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Okay, nothing bad, nothing good. <i>Pod</i>, report to Bunker that ~name~’s meeting expected trends.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,Your ~clothing~ is interesting, ~name~. I mean, not as interesting as what you’ve got left to show, but interesting.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,What a pain.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh. I’d have figured you’d have gone for something a little more secure, ~name~. No need to rush. And I’m not saying that just because my uplink froze.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=calm,I noticed you were still wearing your ~clothing~...
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=interested,~Clothing~? At this stage of the game, with these conditional modifiers?
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
3-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
3-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
3-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,~Clothing~... Maybe I should try something like that…
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=excited,I guess it probably doesn’t provide you much of a reason to keep it on past the first stage...
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Well, that’s that I guess.
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=happy,I have to admit, I was expecting you to deviate from this model a bit more…
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=clever,I guess that’s not terrible for a late game play, ~name~.
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, at least you’re almost out of items.
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,If you wouldn’t mind, can I see what makes that so important to you?
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=confident,It’s kind of odd you have everything hanging out and still have that for your very last piece, but… I guess that’s how some people like to play.
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
3-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
3-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
3-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
3-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
3-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
3-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
3-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
3-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
3-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
3-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,I’m still in this, if I can keep ~name~ losing.
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. Even though I’m… Like this, I still have a chance with ~name~.
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,Hm. ~name~’s making a standard play… Or is she?
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,<i>Pod</i>, note ~name~’s choice of ~clothing~. I… May need to review this later.
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=calm,I’m kind of a fast learner, ~name~.
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,You seem distracted, ~name~.
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,Yeah, yeah. This choice makes no sense, ~name~...
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=calm,I’m surprised you held onto that for so long, ~name~. I’m here mostly exposed and...
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.

3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.

3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
3-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
3-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
3-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
3-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,I mean, to beat her at this game.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,That’s kind of an odd first play. Don’t worry, ~name~, I’m sure you’ll catch up.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,Not a bad play at all.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=excited,Don’t count me out yet, ~name~. The longer this goes, the better my odds!
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=confident,I’m learning that based on your endorphin levels, I’m falling in the top 40% of what you find attractive.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,I’m guessing I’m the distraction here, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, that’s over with.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=confident,Okay. Well, we’ve already seen your breasts and genitals, so...


#lost shorts
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
4-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
4-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
4-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
4-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
4-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
4-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. That’s a good play, but not super satisfying.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,<i>Pod</i>, check the composition of ~name~’s ~clothing~. I’m hoping there’s more to it than just…
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,<i>Pod</i>--Oh! It says your algorithm has finished compiling, ~name~. It can be wrong sometimes, so I’d better watch closely.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,I tried to run a <i>Search</i> off of my Pod, but I see you’re coming right to us.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=excited,There’s really no bad options with you, ~name~.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,~clothing~? Hm. It’s not <i>quite</i> as stylish as my combat gear, but it’s still handsome.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=calm,Hm.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=excited,Okay, you’re going to have to teach me this trick, ~name~.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
4-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
4-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
4-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
4-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,Not bad, ~name~. Have you ever considered helping the YorHa project?
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,Well, I can’t really complain since you’ve been kicking my butt so far.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=happy,Neck and neck, ~name~.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,I’ll give it to you, ~name~, I’m usually pretty quick to adapt, but you’re putting up a great fight.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,<i>So</i> close.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,Good tactics, ~name~.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,It makes no sense you kept that for last, but it seems to definitely be having an arousing effect...
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, I suppose there’s only one thing left...
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
4-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
4-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
4-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
4-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
4-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
4-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
4-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
4-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
4-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
4-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
4-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
4-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
4-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=frustrated,Yeah, yeah.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=clever,This seems like a fine first piece. I wish I’d seen it a little sooner.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,That’s a start. I hope I’ll enjoy the view as much as you have mine.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,Is that an old world ~clothing~?
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,Well, you’re down by one more, ~name~.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=calm,You’re showing a lot of skin, ~name~, it’s a shame this isn’t much more.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,I’m mostly just confused as to why you held onto that for so long…
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=clever,So, any particular reason you saved that for last, ~name~? I mean, you can basically see all of me, and I can see all of you, so...
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
4-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
4-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
4-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
4-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
4-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
4-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
4-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
4-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
4-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
4-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Well, anyway, I’m not hoping you’ll <i>lose</i> as much as my predictive algorithms will help me <i>win</i>.
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,I’m excited to see what else
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,<i>Pod</i>, go ahead and adjust her algorithm. I’m going to need to go on the offensive.
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,~name~’s ~clothing~ doesn’t seem to be showing any particularly advanced technology…
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=clever,We can see so much of you, but it doesn’t seem like it’s over just yet.
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=confident,Almost done, ~name~?
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=excited,I like this view, ~name~.
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, you’re almost out, ~name~. Let’s see what’s next.

5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
5-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
5-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
5-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
5-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
5-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
5-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
5-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Oh?
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Hm.
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,It’s hard to lose track of your performance, ~name~.
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,Oh, you’re up again, ~name~?
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,I get a little anxious when games get close like this, ~name~. But I’m not exactly a stranger to losing with a partner.
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=excited,I told you I was going to optimize my strategy using the tactical visor. That means I’ll keep going like this until I’m down, ~name~.
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=calm,You’re lucky all the good stuff
5-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,It’s… Weird you’d save that ~clothing~ for last.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
5-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
5-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
5-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=happy,I’m not exactly complaining but...
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,For a first move, that seems fair.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,I wish you’d take off a little more. I’m interested to see if the rest of you is as appealing as your playstyle.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Well, taken as a whole, you definitely have a lot of aesthetic appeal. Man to man, you’re very engaging, ~name~.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,I mean losing a game. Not the euphemism for “going down,” though I do die a lot when 2B’s around.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,Hm. If we’re both exposed like this, maybe we should try that “going down” thing. I believe the tactile feedback would be even better than the optical.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=interested,Well, I’m happy that I’m not the only man like this, but that it’s ~name~ makes this even better.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, that’s that, ~name~. I have to say, I like the visuals on this look!
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
5-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
5-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
5-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
5-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
5-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
5-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
5-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
5-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
5-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
5-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
5-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
5-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
5-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
5-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
5-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
5-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
5-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=frustrated,I’m losing this badly?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=frustrated,I’m… Not used to being so bad at games like this.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,Why don’t I scout ahead and see what you have next, ~name~?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=excited,Oh, your ~clothing~? Not your… Uh, other stuff?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,Don’t get overconfident. One or two bad hands and <i>woosh</i>, you’re naked like me, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,Looks like the cards are “drawing down” on you, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=interested,You’ve put up a good match, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=calm,<i>Pod</i>, make sure to scan this supplemental data. Based on ~name~’s figure, I think many of the female androids might like to get a good look at her.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
5-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
5-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
5-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
5-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
5-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
5-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
5-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
5-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
5-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
5-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
5-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
5-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
5-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=rage,I can’t even really enjoy this, if I’m being honest!
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=rage,I can’t believe I’m this far behind!
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,It’s not that what you’re taking off is boring, it’s just… A little behind where my model told me to expect.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,Well, no tactical plan survives encounter with the enemy. Not that you and I couldn’t be friends, ~name~.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=excited,Let’s see what your next play is, since you’re really… Exposed.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,This was fun, ~name~. We aren’t much separated now.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=excited,I’d be happy to do a more in-depth study, if this is how you… Act and play. And look.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,Would you want to try again sometimes?


#naked
-3-male_removing_minor=frustrated,Hm. Not quite small enough to complain about, not quite big enough to be really satisfying.
-3-male_removing_minor=happy,Well, your ~clothing~ is fine too. I mean, you’re doing fine, and are fine, so the clothing is fine.

-3-female_removing_minor=interested,~name~, are you… Looking at me? I’m definitely looking at you.
-3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
-3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should be running my combat algorithms to keep up with her... I don't lose easily, and I won't go down without a fight...)
-3-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
-3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
-3-female_removed_minor=confident,Well, I’m not out yet, but even though I’ve almost lost, it seems like this game gets more enjoyable as time goes on...
-3-female_removed_minor=happy,I think you look better without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.

-2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
-2-male_removed_minor=interested,That’s much better than I was expecting.
-2-male_removed_minor=happy,Well, it’s not <i>quite</i> as exciting as something bigger, but it’s definitely enjoyable to see come off.
-2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>

-2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
-2-female_removing_minor=excited,Wow, your ~clothing~? How classy.
-2-female_removing_minor=confident,I think I’ve seen 6O fabricate something like that… For her roleplay nights.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=frustrated,You know, like... maybe this'll make a good record for something, someday?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=clever,Two girls with glasses, and a boy with a visor. ~Player~, you're a fan of eyes, huh?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:4=calm,<i>Sigh.</i> She doesn't materialize on film. Okay, creators of this simulation, I'm not used to this kind of opponent...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! I see. It's just like a normal YorHa jump. She's just chaining short hops, huh?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=confident,Awfully confident for someone who is mathmatically wrong.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=interested,Is this a big problem in your world? The witches, I mean?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=interested,Impressive... ordnance. Sorry, Sheena, you're... very distracting.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=interested,Hm... What are you holding back, Sola?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.


#finished
-1-male_removing_minor=calm,Oh, a medium-sized piece like ~name~’s ~clothing~ seems fair.
-1-male_removing_minor=interested,~name~’s ~clothing~?
-1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-1-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Oh uh... no, Jin. I'm a scanner. Of course I'm inquisitve by nature.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,...I see. And can you really see the future? That might explain part of the temporal anomaly...
-1-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=frustrated,...I knew that. I'm a Scanner. I have to know things like that.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=calm,Yeah... my uniform was developed to fight the Machines. I understand being attached to black clothing.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1=clever,Can't break the model, Kamina. It's worth taking a risk, but don't be all talk.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4=happy,Personally, I hope you keep the cloak last. It's a heroic look.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,marker:pod_153=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i> record this for later. For reasons.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=frustrated,Sorry, didn't mean to offend you. I like the look, I just didn't expect it.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=happy,I've never seen a YorHa model fight with their feet. Your shoes are really worn down, so I took you for that kind of fighter.
-1-male_removed_minor=happy,I guess losing isn’t so bad, if you can sit back and enjoy the game instead of analyzing everything.
-1-male_removed_minor=excited,You’ll have to teach me a bit more about your strategy, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-1-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Your muscle composition, even with those strange Trion particles, is... definitely worth additional study.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=clever,...Anyway, I'll get to the bottom of this weird data in this simulation. One way or another.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=confident,Hardly any difference. And believe me, I've got an eye and a Pod for details.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=frustrated,Don't get mad, just tell me about your Stand.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2=happy,I'll admit, I like your optimism. It's so much beter than being fatalistic all the time.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=confident,Hm... I kind of wish I had a scarf or something. The movement probably looks really cool.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=interested,...Impressive. Truly impressive.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,To be honest, I like your personality. Everyone in the Bunker can be so... <i>dry</i>.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:wince=calm,I see. Haven't you seen a technician or a doctor to try and refit your broken parts?
-1-female_removing_minor=excited,Hmm. I’d offer a prediction, but it’s obvious this didn’t quite go how I expected it, so why worry too much?
-1-female_removing_minor=happy,It’s never a bad day to see ~name~ lose a hand. I mean, based on today.
-1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-1-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,Though I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=happy,Don't be so startled, Lotte. Sometimes, getting out of your comfort zone is essential for catching outliers in your analysis.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=interested,Hm? They both have red hair and glasses...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Wait</i>. She doesn't record? What?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=interested,She doesn't seem like a threat... but her floating without use of an anti-grav apparatus is interesting...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,(I should have run my combat algorithms to keep up with her...)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=frustrated,She's terribly unsettling for such a small girl.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=happy,...But if it's a fight you want, I'd be happy to give it to you.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=interested,Huh... so what kind of powers <i>does</i> it give you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan the area? I'd hate to be caught off guard...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=calm,But I liked that sash!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>I'm still waiting on her vengeful nature to kick in... don't let your guard down, Nines.</i>
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
-1-female_removed_minor=confident,Sometimes extrapolating trend data isn’t as reliable as I’d like, overall...
-1-female_removed_minor=clever,Oh, ~name~, the thought occurs, can you explain the euphemism “laying pipe?” The only pipelines I can think of are for fluids or data. Oh. Wait, okay, nevermind.
-1-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=custom:Pod,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... what trick are you going to use?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,I see. I'm not a servant of this "Witch" you're talking about, but it's good to survey the competition, right?

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=happy,Huh. I guess this’ll have to do for now.
male_removed_major=interested,No no, your stripping is great! I mean my algorithm.
female_removing_major=excited,Context-based targeting isn’t working...
female_removed_major=confident,But I’m happy you’re taking off something big.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
0-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...
0-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,You're a fascinating competitor, Jotaro... I bet we'd have been great partners!
0-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,It takes all types, huh, Oracle?
0-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=rage,Keep fighting, Kamina! Let's show them what we're made of!
0-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=rage,Is--is that a hand!?
0-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
0-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
0-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,That’s a strong start, ~name~.
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,~name~’s got a hard opening. <i>Pod</i>, account for his shock and awe tactics!
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Your ~clothing~ isn’t doing you any good, ~name~, maybe losing it’ll help you focus.
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=excited,Current tactics are clearly working, judging by the size of that piece. I’m not going easy on you, ~name~!
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,~name~, you’re running out of options. You should probably focus if you want to take me on.
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,You’re out of your league, ~name~. Not to get overconfident, but I hope you’re holding out on us.
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,For something so big, I’m pretty surprised you saved that for last instead of protecting your anatomy…
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=rage,You held onto something so big for so long, but despite losing, you showed off your weaknesses? That’s way too overconfident, ~name~.
0-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?

0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6=frustrated,They say overconfidence is a pretty insidious killer.
0-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=frustrated,20,000 Yen...? Uh... Seems pricy. I really wish stuff like stopping time extended beyond brief simulations like this...
0-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=interested,I feel his Manly Energy flowing through me...
0-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm that? Something is messing with my sensors...
0-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him for this "Killer Queen" he mentioned.
0-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=interested,You're really quite a strong guy, huh? Your endurance has to be incredible. You'd make an impressive sparring partner! Want to press yourself against a Scanner-class model?
0-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,You’re keeping it interesting. I’d have guessed you’d start smaller.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=excited,This is going to be fun, ~name~!
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=clever,That’s a substantial loss for an early game play.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,You’re going to have to play better, ~name~. Keep going like this and it’ll be over for you and I won’t have even started yet...
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=confident,At this point, I shouldn’t really be surprised. I’d just expected more a fight to get here.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,I was hoping to improve my behavioral algorithms, but between my Pod and myself, it doesn’t look like I really need much fine tuning for human men, ~name~.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,9S to Operator. 9S: No casualties. ~name~: 8. Consider this report sufficient countermeasures.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=calm,I’ll admit that I don’t get your strategy, ~name~, but I don’t want to waste a lot of time studying one that’s so clearly… bad.
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
0-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!
0-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
0-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
0-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan Haru...? I feel... strange.
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Hm... I'm seeing some behavioral disalignment...
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=calm,Oh, at the YorHa project, female-body androids have a synthetic bodysuit under their outfits. It's actually remarkably resistant to environmental damage...
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=custom:Pod,Wait, that wasn't obvious? Oh... right. I guess the rest of you don't have nine factor optical analysis...
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=calm,Hm... do you normally undress when writing "FanFic?" What kind of file is that? A report, I imagine?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
0-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, clear my memory buffer. Mavis has some sort of hypnotic property...
0-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like."
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear underwear. Now I'm going to get &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;."
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought."
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now."
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=frustrated,...It's a shame I couldn't loan you some of my regeneration chips. I'd hate to stand by and let you get slaughtered.
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=happy,I always like things that leave an interesting silhouette in motion. YorHa doesn't let us have that type of equipment, however.
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,How'd you take that off without disturbing your hat?
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=clever,Wait, you’re starting with your ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Huh! I didn’t expect you to lose your ~clothing~ first.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hmm. It seems a little early to take off your ~clothing~, ~name~.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,That’s a big hit for so early in the game.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=confident,You’re really running out of options, ~name~.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=clever,9S to Bunker. Status report: ~name~ continues to lose, while I suffer no losses. Syncing encounter data now.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Well, it’s a big piece, but you kind of put it in a bad spot, because everyone can see… Well, almost everything.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=rage,Your choices in this game don’t make sense. Are you some sort of deliberately bugged simulation, ~name~? Maybe a logic virus spiked into my visor or something?
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
0-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
0-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
0-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=frustrated,S-sorry, ma'am. Mommy? Uh... nevermind.
0-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,id:2=confident,Show us what you're made of, Haru, no holding back.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
0-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
0-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
0-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
0-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
0-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is this supposed to be a grand gesture? A bad play? Something to incite confusion…? Well, it’s working.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=interested,I can’t wait to see what other plays you’re going to make, ~name~. That’s quite the start!
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,With your load lightened, maybe you can perform better.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=clever,I can respect taking smart risks early, but I hope they pay off, ~name~. Your ~clothing~ seemed hard to refabricate.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=confident,I’m not surprised that you had to take off something big, but I am surprised you’re over halfway done and I haven’t even taken off my gloves.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,I wonder if 21O would play like ~name~... Hmm...
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=frustrated,I think you used your ~clothing~ wrong. Why didn’t you cover your other assets, unless this was some sort of deception? Human women are so strange.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=excited,There. That’s all eight of your pieces, without anything down on me. I’d be almost flattered if the goal wasn’t to gather data on game theory.

1-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
1-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...
1-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,You're a fascinating competitor, Jotaro... I bet we'd have been great partners!
1-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,It takes all types, huh, Oracle?
1-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=rage,Keep fighting, Kamina! Let's show them what we're made of!
1-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=rage,Is--is that a hand!?
1-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Oh? Starting strong, ~name~?
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,Hey, ~name~, just because it’s your first lost doesn’t mean you <i>have</i> to make a big show of confidence.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Not an unusual play, but if you’re dropping a big piece like that early...
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=happy,I think I’ll enjoy this. Great data and an interesting physical display.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,All according to plan. Note that plan means a compiled series of data based on your hormone levels, stance display, and corroborated using existing background statistics and my own high levels of training as a YorHa scanner unit.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,Hm. Well, your ~clothing~ matches trend data.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,Are you taunting me, ~name~? These models are really important, and beneficial for the glory of mankind.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Oh, so you’re not very smart. That’s… Disappointing.
1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
1-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.

1-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,Well, this was a pleasant diversion.
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,Now that we’re caught up, keep on playing how you’re playing, ~name~. Don’t go easy on me, because I’m not going to go easy on you.
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,Are you going to be taking this more seriously, now, ~name~?
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,Hm. Cortisol and testosterone are rising. Are you going to give up a better fight now, ~name~?
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=excited,Not bad, ~name~. Not good, given how poorly you’re doing. But it’s not bad!
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,Well, we’re reaching the end, ~name~. Any more tricks up your sleeve? Does that euphemism even apply now?
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,Well, you look good, at least, even if you’re playing like an idiot.
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=rage,If you deliberately try and provoke me into making weird responses, you’ll be making things a lot harder for Scanner units down the line!

1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?
1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=frustrated,...It's a shame I couldn't loan you some of my regeneration chips. I'd hate to stand by and let you get slaughtered.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=happy,I always like things that leave an interesting silhouette in motion. YorHa doesn't let us have that type of equipment, however.
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,How'd you take that off without disturbing your hat?
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Hm. My encounter data for human females in your age range and phenotypic skillset suggested you’d start with something a little smaller… Way to keep it interesting, ~name~.
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=clever,~Clothing~? You must be really confident, ~name~. But now that I’ve gotten started, I hope you don’t think I’ll lose as easily as I lost that first hand.
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=happy,Looks like I take the lead, ~name~.
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,~name~’s taking off her ~clothing~. <i>Pod</i>, give me diagnostics...
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=clever,That’s a good choice accordingly to the algorithm. And, you know, enjoyment.
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh. You’re looking really… Wow, ~name~.
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=happy,Well, ~name~, you saved that for last, which makes some sense… But not if you’re already so exposed… Hmm…
1-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Hmm. You should’ve probably used that to cover something.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
1-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...
1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=frustrated,S-sorry, ma'am. Mommy? Uh... nevermind.
1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,id:2=confident,Show us what you're made of, Haru, no holding back.
1-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
1-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=excited,That evens it up. I’d have expected you to start smaller, though.
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=confident,What’s next for you, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,This was impressive. Let’s keep it up, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,According to my analytics, a big play like that’ll keep people invested for quite a bit. Smart move, ~name~!
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=calm,That’s a pretty typical play, but you’re really far behind, ~name~. With your ~clothing~ gone, are you going to play better?
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, the data you’re generating isn’t anything particularly exciting… But for some reason I want to see more…?
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Once you’re finished, could you tell me why you didn’t just… Wear that?
1-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=excited,You’re weird, ~name~, but it’s kind of cute how you defy expectation.


#lost boots
2-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
2-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...
2-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,You're a fascinating competitor, Jotaro... I bet we'd have been great partners!
2-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,It takes all types, huh, Oracle?
2-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=rage,Keep fighting, Kamina! Let's show them what we're made of!
2-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=rage,Is--is that a hand!?
2-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
2-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
2-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,For his first play, ~name~’s taking off ~clothing~!
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you really taking your ~clothing~ off first? Did my two losses really make me seem that pathetic?
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,<i>Pod</i>, compare ~name~’s ~clothing~ to his behavioral algorithm…
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,That’s pretty interesting, ~name~!
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,This is a big loss for you, ~name~. I don’t want to be a bully, so I’ll let you in on a secret...
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,I’m not going to throw a hand just because you’re losing.
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=confident,And ~name~ should be finished now.
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=interested,You know, I get why you held onto that for so long. But aren’t you showing off the important things?
2-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6=frustrated,They say overconfidence is a pretty insidious killer.
2-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=frustrated,20,000 Yen...? Uh... Seems pricy. I really wish stuff like stopping time extended beyond brief simulations like this...
2-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=interested,I feel his Manly Energy flowing through me...
2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm that? Something is messing with my sensors...
2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him for this "Killer Queen" he mentioned.
2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=interested,You're really quite a strong guy, huh? Your endurance has to be incredible. You'd make an impressive sparring partner! Want to press yourself against a Scanner-class model?
2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=interested,That’s a bold start, ~name~. Let’s see what comes after your ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=excited,Well… I liked that ~clothing~, ~name~. It was a good defense to forfeit.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=happy,It’s a bit early for something like that, but I’m not complaining.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,Huh. That’s a good variant choice. Usually human males don’t opt to to that at this stage in the game.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,I will let you know my next item is fairly important.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,I’m not going to upload <i>this</i> to my records.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Why did you save that?
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=excited,All over but the actual losing, ~name~. I look forward to seeing how you finalize your encounter data.
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
2-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!
2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
2-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan Haru...? I feel... strange.
2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Hm... I'm seeing some behavioral disalignment...
2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=calm,Oh, at the YorHa project, female-body androids have a synthetic bodysuit under their outfits. It's actually remarkably resistant to environmental damage...
2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=custom:Pod,Wait, that wasn't obvious? Oh... right. I guess the rest of you don't have nine factor optical analysis...
2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=calm,Hm... do you normally undress when writing "FanFic?" What kind of file is that? A report, I imagine?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
2-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, clear my memory buffer. Mavis has some sort of hypnotic property...
2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like."
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear underwear. Now I'm going to get &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;."
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought."
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now."
2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?

2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,How'd you take that off without disturbing your hat?
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,I’d critique going so hard from the get-go, but you are pretty ahead of me, ~name~...
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Wow, ~name~’s definitely feeling brave. I
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hm. I guess something big has to come off without showing your weakpoints at some stage… I guess you wanted this one, huh?
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=excited,That’s a bold statement.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Yeah, yeah. You lost the hand, something big is coming off, and so on.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,There we go. I wish I were just a bit more ahead, but your ~clothing~ seems like a good choice.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,<i>Sigh</i>.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,~name~... You’re about to lose but…
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
2-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...

2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=frustrated,I haven’t seen someone goad other players since A2…
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,When you’re doing well, I guess it’s easy to get caught up in the moment.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,I wouldn’t overdo it, even if you’re doing well against me, ~name~. Don’t ask for your ~clothing~ back if I start winning.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,That’s interesting apparel, but what’s more interesting is how you look now, ~name~.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,<i>Pod</i>, make sure you record my vitals. I’m feeling a lot of things watching ~name~.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=excited,Good data, and good visual variety here tonight! Most of the androids I know are just restricted to very similar appearances, though their personalities differ a lot!
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,I really shouldn’t have to tell you saving your ~clothing~ for after the important parts are exposed isn’t the way this is supposed to work.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=happy,You look great like this, ~name~. It’s actually really cool to see what someone looks like without having to be modified into looking like that.

3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
3-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...
3-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,You're a fascinating competitor, Jotaro... I bet we'd have been great partners!
3-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,It takes all types, huh, Oracle?
3-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=rage,Keep fighting, Kamina! Let's show them what we're made of!
3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=rage,Is--is that a hand!?
3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=excited,I like the forwardness!
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,Just because you’re ahead and making big plays like that just means this is going to be more fun.
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,<i>Pod</i>, note that this playstyle is having a high success rate in both arousing this Scanner unit and winning the game.
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=happy,Don’t worry ~name~, you’ll be all caught up in no time.
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Everyone’s running out of armor
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=clever,I see you’re deploying major countermeasures.
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,He saved his ~clothing~ for last? Why? Everything else is already on display?
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=interested,Are you hiding something more defenseless than your anatomy, ~name~? Something embarrassing?
3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
3-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6=frustrated,They say overconfidence is a pretty insidious killer.
3-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=frustrated,20,000 Yen...? Uh... Seems pricy. I really wish stuff like stopping time extended beyond brief simulations like this...
3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=interested,I feel his Manly Energy flowing through me...
3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm that? Something is messing with my sensors...
3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him for this "Killer Queen" he mentioned.
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=interested,You're really quite a strong guy, huh? Your endurance has to be incredible. You'd make an impressive sparring partner! Want to press yourself against a Scanner-class model?
3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,Don’t get sloppy now, ~name~.
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=happy,Well, I hope you catch up soon.
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=interested,Huh, I didn’t expect to be so neck and neck with ~name~.
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=clever,I wonder why you came out tonight, ~name~? Maybe we could talk a litlte more about it.
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=confident,Let’s keep at it.
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=calm,You have a little more fight, huh, ~name~?
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,I still can’t make sense of the play. I keep reviewing the materials… Are you just trying to troll?
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Well, whatever reason you kept that on, you’re almost done.
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
3-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!
3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan Haru...? I feel... strange.
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Hm... I'm seeing some behavioral disalignment...
3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=calm,Oh, at the YorHa project, female-body androids have a synthetic bodysuit under their outfits. It's actually remarkably resistant to environmental damage...
3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=custom:Pod,Wait, that wasn't obvious? Oh... right. I guess the rest of you don't have nine factor optical analysis...
3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=calm,Hm... do you normally undress when writing "FanFic?" What kind of file is that? A report, I imagine?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
3-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, clear my memory buffer. Mavis has some sort of hypnotic property...
3-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like."
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear underwear. Now I'm going to get &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;."
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought."
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now."
3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=frustrated,...It's a shame I couldn't loan you some of my regeneration chips. I'd hate to stand by and let you get slaughtered.
3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=happy,I always like things that leave an interesting silhouette in motion. YorHa doesn't let us have that type of equipment, however.
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
3-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
3-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,How'd you take that off without disturbing your hat?
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Wow, you’ve gotten me down three before you even lost one? I appreciate you taking off something big!
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=excited,Really? <i>Pod</i>, whatever ~name~’s doing, it’s working. Try and emulate her pattern for me.
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=happy,So you’re going to try and make a big play early, huh?
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,Oh! This should be enjoyable.
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Your ~clothing~, ~name~? You’re almost done!
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=excited,<i>Pod</i>, you can scrub this. It’s nice just to watch.
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=clever,It’s a good idea to save your big stuff for last...
3-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=happy,I understand why you’d preserve countermeasures, but with my first big loss out of the way...
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
3-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...
3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=frustrated,S-sorry, ma'am. Mommy? Uh... nevermind.
3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,id:2=confident,Show us what you're made of, Haru, no holding back.
3-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
3-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
3-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.

3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
3-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
3-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,Thanks, ~name~. Though it’s not the best move, what’s life without a little kindness, huh?
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=happy,There’s not a lot of time for kindness when there’s Machine Lifeforms involved… But thanks, ~name~.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,I mean, tactical simulations are thrilling, but seeing real exposed flesh that’s not… Uh, violent, is pretty. Pretty good.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,Man, this is getting really fun! The tension has to be something else, for you and me alike.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,Hm. Yes, yes, please do go on.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, you’re really getting down to nothing, huh, ~name~? I hope I won’t be following.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=confident,...I wonder if you could’ve thought that through better.
3-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=frustrated,I… Feel really aggressive now for some reason.

4-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=calm,Yeah, yeah, we get that you’re amazing at this.
4-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,It’s interesting. Once I’m down to the little items, your big stuff just seems that much better, ~name~. Just like the model expected.
4-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,There we go. Looks like my model is <i>finally</i> working.
4-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,This is… Way better in person than just in simulation, I think.
4-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=excited,Okay! Shouldn’t be long now, should it?
4-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,You saved ~clothing~? Even now? <i>Sigh.</i> Do you know how hard it is to measure erratic behavior?

4-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6=frustrated,They say overconfidence is a pretty insidious killer.
4-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=frustrated,20,000 Yen...? Uh... Seems pricy. I really wish stuff like stopping time extended beyond brief simulations like this...
4-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=interested,I feel his Manly Energy flowing through me...
4-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm that? Something is messing with my sensors...
4-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him for this "Killer Queen" he mentioned.
4-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=interested,You're really quite a strong guy, huh? Your endurance has to be incredible. You'd make an impressive sparring partner! Want to press yourself against a Scanner-class model?
4-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=happy,Well, hopefully the rest is just as good. I mean, of you.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=interested,Okay, that’s that, right?
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=happy,Speaking of models, have you considered serving as a body template, ~name~? I think the YorHa morale would improve if more male androids looked like you.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=interested,Though I have to admit model No.~name~ seems a bit… Indulgent.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,I didn’t even have to hack to get here. Not a bad use of time.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=calm,You know, This is <i>way</i> better when you’re not just looking at it through a screen.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Though, seeing your anatomy is… A mitigating element.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=happy,Well, at least we get to see <i>all</i> of you now. No need to be shy, ~name~. It’s just a body!
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
4-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
4-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
4-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan Haru...? I feel... strange.
4-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Hm... I'm seeing some behavioral disalignment...
4-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=calm,Oh, at the YorHa project, female-body androids have a synthetic bodysuit under their outfits. It's actually remarkably resistant to environmental damage...
4-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=custom:Pod,Wait, that wasn't obvious? Oh... right. I guess the rest of you don't have nine factor optical analysis...
4-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=calm,Hm... do you normally undress when writing "FanFic?" What kind of file is that? A report, I imagine?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
4-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, clear my memory buffer. Mavis has some sort of hypnotic property...
4-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like."
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear underwear. Now I'm going to get &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;."
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought."
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now."
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
4-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
4-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=frustrated,...It's a shame I couldn't loan you some of my regeneration chips. I'd hate to stand by and let you get slaughtered.
4-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=happy,I always like things that leave an interesting silhouette in motion. YorHa doesn't let us have that type of equipment, however.
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
4-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,How'd you take that off without disturbing your hat?
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,Hey, I don’t mind playing with a handicap. It’s ~name~’s choice if she wants to be suboptimal.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=clever,Oh, I see, you’re trying to be distracting, aren’t you?
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=rage,You know, I’m all out of major items, so it makes me a little jealous to see that you still have some.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,I’m not jealous that ~name~’s just now taking off something big.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,~name~, I’m interested to see what you look like without your ~clothing~...
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,This’ll be good.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=confident,Okay, that’s an odd last choice.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=rage,Oh come on, I’m almost out of the game, why are you showing off everything else but keeping a grip on that?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
4-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=frustrated,S-sorry, ma'am. Mommy? Uh... nevermind.
4-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,id:2=confident,Show us what you're made of, Haru, no holding back.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
4-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
4-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
4-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
4-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
4-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
4-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=confident,You might regret being so hasty, ~name~. I’m just about to step it up.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,Well, I’m happy I at least get to see ~name~ lose once.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,Well, don’t count yourself or me out just yet. We still have a lot of hands left to play in this simulation!
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,I’m not too far ahead of you, ~name~. Though… Maybe you’d like for me to get behind you?
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh wow, you have such wonderful… Assets. Do you ever back those up?
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,<i>Pod</i>, backup my data to bunker. ~name~ is making my black box sizzle.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=confident,Fine, you’re vulnerable, I’m not, let’s keep going.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,What a pain you are. In terms of analysis, I uh, mean.


#lost boxers
5-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
5-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...
5-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,You're a fascinating competitor, Jotaro... I bet we'd have been great partners!
5-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,It takes all types, huh, Oracle?
5-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=rage,Keep fighting, Kamina! Let's show them what we're made of!
5-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=rage,Is--is that a hand!?
5-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
5-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, run a quick diagnostic...
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,Oh wow, you’re playing really well, except for the “removing a major article first,” ~name~.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your Old World-style ~clothing~?
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Your ~clothing~? I was wondering when you’d be removing that countermeasure…
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,Wow, ~name~, you’re easy on the eyes.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Hmm. The combat visor has no negative filtering set… So I can see you just as well with it on as I would without it.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=happy,Phew. Close match, ~name~.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,I’m just glad to be finally done.
5-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
5-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.

5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...

5-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,Well, Pod hasn’t led me wrong yet, so I guess you aren’t cheating, ~name~.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=frustrated,You started with something big. It’s a big start. But it’s just a start...
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,Say, does your ~clothing~ happen to come in my size? I bet it’d look good in black. And reinforced for combat.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=happy,I have to say, I’m liking the variety of ~name~’s ~clothing~ over the kind of… Monochromatic thing we have going on at YorHa.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,Oh wow, ~name~’s taking off his ~clothing~? While I’m exposed like this?
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, I assume you’re easy on the eyes even without my visor, anyway. Maybe easier, given the lack of constant data influx.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=calm,I’m running out of interesting commentary. Suffice to say, I’m surprised you saved a major article for last.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Scanning and commenting on all this tactical data isn’t easy… So I hope you know that despite that, it was worth it, ~player~.
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
5-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!

5-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Well, thanks, ~name~. I appreciate the concession.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,Aw, ~name~, you shouldn’t have.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,It’s a start, but not a terribly strong one.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,Did you consider bringing more big stuff, or is it just a hassle to keep that on before taking off smaller things?
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,A typical play. But, still enjoyable.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,~name~, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Hm. You’ve held onto that for a while, ~name~.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=interested,So, you’re saving your big ~clothing~ for last?
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
5-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...
5-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
5-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
5-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
5-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
5-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=frustrated,S-sorry, ma'am. Mommy? Uh... nevermind.
5-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,id:2=confident,Show us what you're made of, Haru, no holding back.
5-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
5-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
5-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
5-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
5-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
5-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
5-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
5-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
5-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=confident,You’re being very generous, but don’t think I’m going to just roll over.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,But I’m not out just yet. Keep it going!
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,I’m just curious. I don’t… Really wear other outfits.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,I think a lot of the people who participate in these simulation exercises don’t tend to consider other types of costumes.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,It helps that you’re pretty and confident. Or um. I think you are.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=calm,I can understand if it was smaller, but isn’t it defeating the purpose of the game if we can already see the rest of you?
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,There. Almost done.

-3-male_removing_major=interested,~name~’s taking off something big. His ~clothing~, it looks like.
-3-male_removing_major=happy,That’s certainly interesting, ~name~.
-3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
-3-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...
-3-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,You're a fascinating competitor, Jotaro... I bet we'd have been great partners!
-3-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,It takes all types, huh, Oracle?
-3-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3=rage,Keep fighting, Kamina! Let's show them what we're made of!

-3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
-3-male_removed_major=clever,I think there’s an expression for how I’m feeling. “Hot under the collar?”
-3-male_removed_major=confident,~name~’s kind of tempting me to lose this next hand.
-3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
-3-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.

-3-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6=frustrated,They say overconfidence is a pretty insidious killer.
-3-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=frustrated,20,000 Yen...? Uh... Seems pricy. I really wish stuff like stopping time extended beyond brief simulations like this...
-3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=interested,I feel his Manly Energy flowing through me...
-3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm that? Something is messing with my sensors...
-3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him for this "Killer Queen" he mentioned.
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=interested,You're really quite a strong guy, huh? Your endurance has to be incredible. You'd make an impressive sparring partner! Want to press yourself against a Scanner-class model?
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
-3-female_removing_major=happy,~clothing~? Hmm. Brave choice.
-3-female_removing_major=interested,It’s a good thing I can mitigate stimulus to certain anatomical components…
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
-3-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!
-3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
-3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
-3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
-3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan Haru...? I feel... strange.
-3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Hm... I'm seeing some behavioral disalignment...
-3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=calm,Oh, at the YorHa project, female-body androids have a synthetic bodysuit under their outfits. It's actually remarkably resistant to environmental damage...
-3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=custom:Pod,Wait, that wasn't obvious? Oh... right. I guess the rest of you don't have nine factor optical analysis...
-3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=calm,Hm... do you normally undress when writing "FanFic?" What kind of file is that? A report, I imagine?
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
-3-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, clear my memory buffer. Mavis has some sort of hypnotic property...
-3-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like."
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear underwear. Now I'm going to get &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;."
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought."
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now."
-3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
-3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
-3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=frustrated,...It's a shame I couldn't loan you some of my regeneration chips. I'd hate to stand by and let you get slaughtered.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=happy,I always like things that leave an interesting silhouette in motion. YorHa doesn't let us have that type of equipment, however.

-3-female_removed_major=clever,Well, at least I’ll have something to look at if I lose the next hand...
-3-female_removed_major=calm,I’d hate to be rude, after all.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.

-2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?

-2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6=frustrated,They say overconfidence is a pretty insidious killer.
-2-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=frustrated,20,000 Yen...? Uh... Seems pricy. I really wish stuff like stopping time extended beyond brief simulations like this...
-2-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4=interested,I feel his Manly Energy flowing through me...
-2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you confirm that? Something is messing with my sensors...
-2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan him for this "Killer Queen" he mentioned.
-2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=interested,You're really quite a strong guy, huh? Your endurance has to be incredible. You'd make an impressive sparring partner! Want to press yourself against a Scanner-class model?
-2-male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Offer's outstanding. Much like part of your anatomy.
-2-female_removing_major=happy,Oh! Yes, please, more like ~name~’s ~clothing~!
-2-female_removing_major=interested,I bet you’ll look even better without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
-2-female_removing_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:3=rage,C'mon, Chihiro! Fight! Don't retreat inward!
-2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
-2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
-2-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
-2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you scan Haru...? I feel... strange.
-2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=custom:Pod,Hm... I'm seeing some behavioral disalignment...
-2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=calm,Oh, at the YorHa project, female-body androids have a synthetic bodysuit under their outfits. It's actually remarkably resistant to environmental damage...
-2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=custom:Pod,Wait, that wasn't obvious? Oh... right. I guess the rest of you don't have nine factor optical analysis...
-2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=calm,Hm... do you normally undress when writing "FanFic?" What kind of file is that? A report, I imagine?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
-2-female_removing_major,target:mavis,targetStage:2=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, clear my memory buffer. Mavis has some sort of hypnotic property...
-2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like."
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear underwear. Now I'm going to get &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;."
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought."
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like "Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid. Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now."
-2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
-2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=frustrated,<i>Results inconclusive?</i> What's that supposed to mean... when that hood comes off, are we going to see something non-human...?
-2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=interested,Actually, hold on a second. This is a much more interesting thing to analyze.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=rage,Bring it on!
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=frustrated,Is this material... alive?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=frustrated,...It's a shame I couldn't loan you some of my regeneration chips. I'd hate to stand by and let you get slaughtered.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:silhouette=happy,I always like things that leave an interesting silhouette in motion. YorHa doesn't let us have that type of equipment, however.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,How'd you take that off without disturbing your hat?
-2-female_removed_major=excited,Can you do the next piece just like that, ~name~?
-2-female_removed_major=clever,I-I’m surprised your ~clothing~ of all things is what provides such a good boost.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=frustrated,...
-2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
-2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
-2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
-2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=frustrated,S-sorry, ma'am. Mommy? Uh... nevermind.
-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,id:2=confident,Show us what you're made of, Haru, no holding back.
-2-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!

-2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
-2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.


#finished
-1-male_removing_major=excited,Interesting! Even though I’ve lost, seeing ~name~’s ~clothing~ come off is eliciting a similar response to earlier.
-1-male_removing_major=confident,Wow, ~name~, you had something big like your ~clothing~ left?
-1-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
-1-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5=interested,But... I think there's wonder in things beyond simple calculations...

-1-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=frustrated,A... hidden power? Is this a bluff?
-1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=happy,...High adenosine triphosphate usage... lactate resistance... slow-twitch fiber development three sigma above sample group...
-1-male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=custom:Pod,Every android is good at doing field repairs, and I have my Pod to help advise me if you wanted me to work the muscles a bit...
-1-male_removed_major=clever,You’re really impressive, ~name~! I wouldn’t mind experiencing this game with you again.
-1-male_removed_major=interested,Oh wow, you look even better without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
-1-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-1-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second non-exposing piece, huh?

-1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Stripes, too? Hm... I guess it does make the aspect ratio on your hips <i>extremely</i> appealing...
-1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=frustrated,I guess it's possible that some players in the simulation have to make things up as they go...
-1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,id:1=happy,Yes! Please. I want to see how you format your data. I've gotten really good at untangling all kind of semantic knots.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=interested,You're using a euphemism, right? I don't really have bodily fluids like a human man...
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=frustrated,Not a human one, no.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=frustrated,You're breaking the model! But... it's not... without appeal. I see.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=happy,I guess even a Scanner can be wrong. You <i>are</i> a human, right, Raven? Look, she's even really cute!
-1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=calm,You seem adequately equipped, but you clearly aren't human, so there's no need for me to pretend like your physical body is all that interesting.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=confident,Impressive. Way to keep things interesting, Ryuko!
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,Well, it seems you two operate like a good team. Feel free to give more details, but I think I'm done for now.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:bracing_sayaka=clever,I'd imagine the tactile sense of wind on your genitals might be quite bracing...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,marker:chips_sayaka=clever,Oh, when you can disengage from a fight, it'd convert carbon in the air into nanotubes that brace damage in your system until you return to the bunker... er... it's like healing.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:6=calm,All I'm saying is that I get why you'd want to keep that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
-1-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=happy,I see! I think it completes your "look," according to my visual analysis.




#OPPONENT REVEALING CHEST OR CROTCH
#Characters have different sizes, allowing your character to have different responses for each. Males have a small, medium, or large crotch. Females have small, medium, or large breasts.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Hmm. You're going to show us your chest, right, ~name~?
male_chest_is_visible=confident,Not bad!
male_crotch_will_be_visible=frustrated,Damn. I'm going to see your penis but my context scanning isn't working... Peculiar...
male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm,Huh. I guess that's small, but is it because we're playing with so many large people?
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy,I think mine matches yours, ~name~.
male_large_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,I didn't know that type of anatomy could come in such a large size. That seems rather inconvenient...
female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,I guess it's time to see those tits of yours, ~name~!
female_small_chest_is_visible=clever,Hm. Those aren't even picking up on my Scanner...
female_large_chest_is_visible=excited,For some reason I get a real mothering instinct from you, ~name~.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,Looks like you're just about done, ~name~. Not that this line should trigger normally.
female_crotch_is_visible=confident,Huh. I can see the appeal.


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hmm… I wonder which one I’d want…
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#lost gloves
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#lost coat
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#lost shorts
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#lost boxers
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#naked
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition... Well, at least to others.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#masturbating
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition... Well, at least to others.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.


#finished
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=happy,I'll refrain from further remarks, and just enjoy the display.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,I'm... tempted. To see how a fight between my planning and your creativity would play out.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=excited,Impressive. Hm. Your pulse rate indicates you're either an incredible liar... or this battle's just about to start. Bring it on, Jin.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro=happy,I think I'm getting the hang of it! I think I saw this "Star Platinum" of yours... but I was a bit distracted by your chest. I'll review the scan later.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=rage,You can't be serious! That's just about the most important part of this game!
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro=interested,Let's see it, Jotaro... Does it measure up to the rest of you?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=interested,Rousing works, but I felt that was more appropriate...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=interested,It just occured to me, do you use the same optical treatment on <i>all</i> of your body hair?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=happy,Impressive glutes.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=calm,Whether or not that was a joke, at least it's impressive. I only get to use one weapon at a time, so I may as well use a sizable one.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro=excited,Impressive! Say what you'd like, but your hormone profile and brain waves are showing excitement, if a little frustration.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=clever,I'm a bit sad your hair isn't styled into a flame.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:3=calm,Oddly fast for a... human...? What's this?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:haru=calm,I just... feel so small and vulnerable... I'd... love to find comfort from the harsh world.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=excited,Oh! You're turning bright pink. Sorry if that comment was frustrating.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,It's admirable... if you don't want me to say anything else...?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mavis=interested,Is your species naturally hairless, by the way?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=happy,Though, I guess we could see the <i>breast</i> part next...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia=clever,Or you can avoid a battle you'd lose. I'm quite skilled at anti-projectile techniques.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=happy,If you designed it, shouldn't it match the rest?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius=custom:Pod,I haven't seen an endothermic program before! <i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! That's a luminous... something! It's hard to even see her!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support unit! It's not effective against my sensors, but it's a great obfuscation technique!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, scan her support units! They gave away her weakness!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, rerun analysis. Are you <i>sure</i> this girl has a vengeful nature? I was expecting more competition... Well, at least to others.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=custom:Pod,<i>Pod</i>, can you interface with... whatever this is?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=interested,<i>Extremely</i> cute. I bet when you move, the freckles can create some rather interesting patterns! It's... quite distracting!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=clever,You seem shockingly calm about all of this. Dignity worthy of a human.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=frustrated,...Don't even talk to me about destiny. <i>Pod</i>, give me whatever you can get on her.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=interested,In person, no. But I like the rest of you too, so this is quite exciting!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mavis=interested,Hm... I wonder if 2B would look like you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,id:6=clever,Seems like you designed a more... minimal approach, Sayaka.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=excited,I can't imagine what you're self conscious about. They're rather large for such a petite girl, aren't they?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly <i>equipped</i> in other ways.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:haru=interested,...Please?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=clever,Sheena, you have to explain how you're doing that!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,count-hero:1-3=confident,<i>Can you</i>? I don't expect you to give up, but don't get overconfident, Remilia.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=clever,...And now for a twist in programming...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru=custom:Pod,...I admit, Haru's proportions are...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=interested,This is something like out of your "FanFic" files, right? A naive android boy finds a soft, gentle human girl... enticing?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=custom:Pod,Hm. Do you trade your underwear or something like that, Mahiru?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mavis=frustrated,...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=calm,Hm. I guess we'll see if this is her final layer or not...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,totalExposed:1-=excited,Hm... I think bodysuits look so much better than some of the "underwear" other people have worn tonight.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=interested,I'm surprised. Does your species of metahuman lack pubic hair, or...?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,alsoPlaying:uravity=custom:Pod,I'll admit, to a human's eye, that must have looked really confusing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=interested,At least it's good to know people find you really attractive!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=frustrated,Are you... trying another distraction?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=clever,...Is this all a ploy to just get naked, but to act coy about it...? You seem like you're rather excited.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:4=frustrated,I kept the secret the whole game, Chihiro. Isn't this a victory, as far as sticking around?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:haru,targetSayingMarker:booty=rage,<i>Even thicker than 2B's? Impossible!</i>
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lotte=happy,I'd love to read that file, if you have any ideas!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=happy,I like to swap weapons and Pod upgrades with 2B. So, I totally understand it.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=happy,It seems like it's kind of exciting to be the only girl, huh?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mavis=happy,Well, I won't complain about the view, at least...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=custom:Pod,Really, it only makes sense. Having something to brace your chest is reasonable... but wouldn't you want to remain flexible down there?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=clever,I see being a confound to a data set runs in the family. Personally, it's interesting to see that those wings are functional!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=clever,Oh! Your pubic hair configuration is certainly interesting. I can't see behind you, but you're facing the rest of us... it's such a brilliant blue... and, uh, lush.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena=confident,You're awfully cute, Sheena. Uh, for another S-type model.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=rage,There it is! My analysis is never wrong! Her vengeful nature is coming!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.

-1-opponent_stripping,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sei_combo1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo2=interested,Sei's a field medic, and Streaming-chan is like a low-grade scanner… They're kind of like a team together.

-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_housewife2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_housewife3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_housewife3=interested,According to Bunker repository data, it seems like the more stressed out Streaming-chan gets, the more viewers she manages to acquire. Seems kind of sadistic to me, but I guess it’s a bit like a Berserker mode.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:nat_doujins2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nat_doujins3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:nat_doujins3=happy,Ah, looks like she's daydreaming about… Streaming-chan's suggestion.

-1-opponent_stripped,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sei_combo2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_combo3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_combo3=clever,...I guess a good strategy is hacking your opponents by plying them with alcohol...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sei,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sei_jill2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:sei_jill3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_jill3=happy,Hm… it’s always interesting to see what kind of personalities can exist in a situation like this.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_must_masturbate=happy,Flawless.
male_start_masturbating=clever,Well, I mean, you seem to be without flaws, but my play was also pretty much error free.
male_masturbating=interested,~name~ certainly looks to be enjoying himself.
male_masturbating=calm,~name~, can you pick up the pace? I’d hate to be stuck here because you couldn’t find a groove.
male_masturbating=interested,Wait, can you back up a bit? I want to see that technique a bit!
male_finished_masturbating=clever,Oh, done already?
female_must_masturbate=happy,Interesting. Let’s see what ~name~’s techniques are like.
female_start_masturbating=interested,I honestly haven’t seen another person do this in… Uh, person.
female_masturbating=calm,~name~’s enjoying herself. That’s nice, even though she lost so fast.
female_masturbating=interested,Wow, that looks like it elicited a great response. Can you do that again so Pod can track it?
female_masturbating=happy,Keep going, ~name~!
female_finished_masturbating=clever,Wow, that was quite the climax. Uh, and the orgasm too.

#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

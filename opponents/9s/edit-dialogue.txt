#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-interested,Operator 6O told me this was a chance to study behaviors that might help my missions with 2B. I’m looking forward to seeing how you all react to the stress of this situation.
start=0-confident,I’m YorHa Scanner unit, designation 9S. I know this card game is pretty simple, but I hope you’ll all give me a good challenge.
start=0-calm,9S here, and ready to observe and analyze this “Inventory” location. If you’d like, you can call me “Nines.”
start=0-clever,Huh, a simulation of an Old World card game? Is this the program you said would help me “blow off some pressure”, 21O?


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

0-stripping=stripping,Well, good news: you got me to lose a round. Bad news: a loss was the last bit my algorithm needed to really step up my game. Here I come, everyone.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripping,It's not a blindfold, it's a combat visor. I can see perfectly fine with it on, Nayru...
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena=stripping,<i>Excuse me,</i> Palutena. I am not a robot. Robots are machines with enough self-awareness not to walk into walls. Mostly.

#losing boots
1-stripped=stripped,I promise I won’t use any hacks here. Just supplementary data.
1-stripped=stripped,Okay, let’s see what you’ve got <i>now</i>.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,A better codename than my model designation? Let me think on that…
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Oh, no, it has a visual feed. It's like looking through a screen from my end.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stripped,I was made by the YorHa project. I'm a Scanner Model, Serial Number 9, Misato. <i>You</i> remind me of <i>my</i> commander.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,And it’s a combat visor. Sort of like your helmet, but mine has a headsup display. Yours is mostly for shielding, right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=confident,I hope it'll be interesting, Pit! Show me what you're made of!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,No need to use hacks here. I'll disable my tactical network... And well, yeah, Palutena, it's not like I <i>really</i> expect to lose.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=happy,It's a designation, Pit, something I was made with. But of course, I do really like Nines!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=confident,...Anyway, Rinkah, my visor doesn't obscure my sight. It even has neat features like heat or moisture tracking. It's uh, fairly enlightening in this situation.
1-must_strip_winning=happy,Well, tonight’s study worked out really well. I think I’ll stop using it so stringently now.
1-must_strip_winning=confident,<i>Pod</i>, you can dethread the data coming in. Let me try this my way for a bit.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:futaba=confident,Oracle… Oh, because you observe behaviors? I get it!
1-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
1-must_strip_normal=interested,Close match so far. I’ll go ahead and store this test file for a bit.
1-must_strip_normal=clever,Yeah, yeah, I’ll turn off the systems data. It’s not hacking, but it is a bit unfair.
1-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:futaba=confident,Oracle… Oh, because you observe behaviors? I get it!
1-must_strip_losing=frustrated,I guess the combat data is less useful than I thought…
1-must_strip_losing=frustrated,<i>Pod</i>, scrap the working file and start over. Let’s try doing this a little looser now.
1-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:futaba=confident,Oracle… Oh, because you observe behaviors? I get it!
1-stripping=stripping,To make up for that last item, I’ll take my socks off with my boots.
1-stripping=stripping,I think I’ll keep the coat on for now. It’s a bit chilly, and apparently it’s important I don’t show my anatomy so early, or I’d have just started from the bottom and gone up.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,I’m not much of an engineer. I mostly use data analysis and a lot of combat experience to make my assessments…
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I'm actually surprised you aren't familiar with Pod technology, Meia!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,I think Oracle would be a great codename for me, too then. You’re kind of like a human Scanner, in a way!


#losing coat
2-stripped=stripped,There. I took off my boots, my socks, and I shut down my tactical network.
2-stripped=stripped,Here we go, this should be a lot more fair, now.
2-stripped=stripped,Right now I’m just finding that the group of people in this simulation are certainly… Something else.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=happy,Oh, I see. So it’s unique… How about… Oathkeeper. Yeah. Oathkeeper! I like it!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,It's an honor to compared to humanity, Palutena. Though, I'm not sure if you're joking or not...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=stripped,Oh, it's after my sword. Cruel Oath. Also, you now, someone that keeps their promises, lives up to their duty, and so on. Very important stuff for a soldier, Pit.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Well, thanks, Pit. It was kind of overkill to use my tactical network at full capacity for just a game.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,...I mean, surely you're familiar with androids, right?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,...Huh. Maybe you've been away from earth so long you aren't familiar with androids and our technology...
2-must_strip_winning=happy,I can cool my subsystems down manually, but I think I’ll really <i>heat up</i> the room with this next play.
2-must_strip_winning=interested,I’ll take off my coat next, just so you all don’t feel so left out. It’s also kinda steamy in here, isn’t it?
2-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
2-must_strip_normal=clever,I’ll admit that even though I’m testing this to gather data, I’d still like to enjoy myself...
2-must_strip_normal=happy,Everyone’s playing pretty well. I guess you’ve earned this.
2-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
2-must_strip_losing=interested,Wow, maybe I should’ve kept my tactical stream on. You’re all doing way better than I thought.
2-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Fine, I turn off my code advantage, I don’t hack, and I lose.
2-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
2-stripping=stripping,Let me just pull off my coat...
2-stripping=stripping,I’m not sure what the patterns are supposed to represent, but I’ve heard that they’re hard for machines to process, so they act kind of like camouflage. Neat, right?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,I'll remove my coat and... huh? No, Mahiru, why would I need one?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,I think the Factotum series is responsible for fabricating most YorHa gear. I could talk to 91F if you'd really like, Palutena.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,marker:machine_rude=stripping,I am not a machine, and it's rude to refer to me that way, Meia.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I think they did a pretty good job with the male anatomy. A lot more patience too, based on what you seem to be used to...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripping,I’m not sure what the patterns are supposed to represent, but I’ve heard that they’re hard for machines to process, so they act kind of like camouflage. Neat, right, Shimakaze?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Thanks! If you're interested in a blacker version of your gear, I'm sure I could have one fabricated. It's a very stylish tunic, Pit!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,Well, not exactly, we're mostly made from carbon fiber and high-octet silicon/titanium meshwork...
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Well, uh, about the “Quirk” thing you’re talking about.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,This is kind of what I was made with, Futaba…


#losing shorts
3-stripped=stripped,Androids don’t need nipples, and I hear they’re vestigial on male humans too. I hear the female models like them, though.
3-stripped=stripped,That was the biggest item I owned. Well, besides <i>Cruel Oath</i>, but why’d I want to bring weapons to a game like this?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,I think most humans seem to find this unusual about my body.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,I mean, my modelers thought it was a superfluous detail. If no nipples is that offputting, I can put in a service request back on the Bunker.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=clever,You know, for someone who's been awfully embarrassed by losing, you sure like to stare, Mahiru...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=excited,Too fast to be seen? Well, you're on display to be studied now! I like how your designers even built in nipple and stimuli receptors!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=stripped,Too fast to be seen? My, you're a marvel of engineering! I'd love to study you, if that's okay? I bet your engineers even put in nipples!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Wait a second, you aren't an android too? The wings definitely don't seem human.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,marker:9s_pit_robot=frustrated,I am not a robot.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jotaro=stripped,Of course. Why would I lie about that, Jotaro?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Well, my core diagnostics say I'm running at a cozy 556K internally. That's Kelvin, if you're more familiar with archaic measures, Palutena.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,I only have a bellybutton because it also operates as a data port... does your species nave nipples, Nayru?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=clever,Well, one of us has to have a perfect figure, huh, Faye?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:4-7=excited,Oh? You can touch if you'd like, Pit! I've never, had another male android touch me before, and I could touch you, since you're also shirtless.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_goron=frustrated,I don't understand what a Goron is... are they similar to androids? Creatures made from metal or something?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_tech=stripped,...with diamond and superconductive filaments to facillitate nervous transmission between our extremeties and our cortical blackbox... Does that answer the question, Jura?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,marker:jura_nips=stripped,...I'm telling you about cutting edge science more than six millenia after your era, and that's what you worry about?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,So I suppose you should be happy with what I’m already showing?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=excited,Oh, I never saw the point of that anatomical upgrade. I did have a penis built in, though, so don't worry, it's not a total loss for you, Elizabeth! (If you can make me lose two more times!)
3-must_strip_winning=confident,After this, I’ll be exposing my second “vital”-rated point.
3-must_strip_winning=clever,I’ll take off something sizable this time.
3-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
3-must_strip_normal=happy,You’re all putting up a really fun match!
3-must_strip_normal=clever,Just because I can use a sword doesn’t always mean it’s my first choice… Like these cards.
3-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
3-must_strip_losing=calm,Okay. I’m losing. So what? I can always just reset if this goes that badly...
3-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Yeah, yeah...
3-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
3-stripping=stripping,Okay, my shorts next.
3-stripping=stripping,These come off really easily. To be honest, I’m actually pretty excited to take them off!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Huh? Why shouldn't I be? Isn't losing part of the fun of this game?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,I think they're comfortable and flexible. It's important to keep up morale against the Machines, Palutena.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Uh, I’m working on that Futaba. And a Phantom Thief? I don’t think I’d ever need to steal something. Though I guess hacking <i>is</i> kind of theft.


#losing boxers
4-stripped=stripped,My pants aren’t super high tech, but they’re flexible and have quite a bit of sample storage space for when Pod can’t make an accurate scan.
4-stripped=stripped,I don’t get why everyone says this is hot. They’ve never felt a blackbox detonation, I’m guessing.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Oh, I usually just steal Machine termination sequences and cause them to self-detonate. So I guess that’s like stealing their hearts?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Huh? Oh, okay. I'm sorry if I haven't asked you a lot about your technical stuff... Like, is it by choice your Pod doesn't have anti-grav?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=stripped,Huh? I'm here to protect humanity, just like you, Pit! I have to hack the machines! Futaba understands!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,count-futaba:1=confident,Codenames, no codenames, this has been kinda... fun!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Sticks don't have short ends. Definitionally, they're one unit of length...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Of course, I mean, I can regulate my internal temperature somewhat, but it's harder without an insulating layer, Pit.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripped,These have quite a bit of sample storage space for when Pod can’t make an accurate scan. And of course, Shimakaze. And in context of this game, I believe explosions should be premeditated.
4-must_strip_winning=happy,I’ve been waiting to try out the new equipment.
4-must_strip_winning=confident,Hm. Okay, let’s try this...
4-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
4-must_strip_normal=calm,So, I guess it’s time for me to take off my underwear...
4-must_strip_normal=confident,This kind of gear does support my uh, extra anatomy, but it’s a little restrictive.
4-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
4-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Okay, I’ll be a good sport. At least I can show off the new equipment...
4-must_strip_losing=rage,I’m only losing because everyone else came out in so much stuff. If I’d brought a support frame, I’d be winning. I’m sure.
4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
4-stripping=stripping,I’ll keep my visor on. It’s not exactly a fair tactic, but hopefully this next part will be distracting.
4-stripping=stripping,Androids aren’t usually created with this type of anatomy, but a lot of us have it installed later.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,...Your "trick" did not work. And seriously? Do you try this a lot?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I think the developers did a pretty good job. Let me know what you think, though... I'm a little excited about all this!


#losing blindfold
5-stripped=stripped,I’m a little shy, so don’t mind me while I let this system warm up a bit.
5-stripped=stripped,I haven’t shown anyone this before, so forgive me a bit if I fiddle with it to get it running.
5-stripped=stripped,Of course I’d keep the visor. What? And lose my tactical advantage while you’re all distracted?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=clever,Yeah, yeah, Meia, it should be functional in the same way a human's is... let me know if your curiosity gets the better of you.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=stripped,Well, Jura, I'm best in class for my model, so once I figure out how the anatomy works, I wouldn't mind testing it with you, I suppose.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=confident,We certainly are an trio, aren't we? After this, maybe we should... <i>Pod</i> what's the euphemism? Oh! Get to know each other!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Well. Uh, thanks, Palutena! (She's so comforting!)
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=frustrated,The engineers are supposed to be really good, Mahiru! I thought it was only supposed to get rigid later...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,You’re so strange, Futaba, but you seem to be enjoying this, so why change a winning strategy?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=interested,I'm... actually not sure. I don't think it <i>explodes</i>, but I think human and most mammals shoot something when they achieve climax. I haven't tested my anatomy until this simulation. Have you, Shimakaze?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,No, Pit. I'm not an automaton. I have wills, desires, and thanks to optional upgrades, the equipment to deliver on them.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=clever,Oh, sorry Elizabeth. It's... As natural as the rest of me? I suppose?
5-must_strip_winning=happy,Okay, everyone else’s either naked, masturbating, or pretty close to one of those. I wouldn’t mind trying that out.
5-must_strip_winning=clever,There. Now we should be all evened up.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:jura=rage,I am <i>not</i> a dungeon bot, or machine, or whatever it is you're implying.
5-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_normal=clever,I played almost a full game with my HUD. It’ll be nice to see you all with my own eyes.
5-must_strip_normal=calm,A loss is a loss.
5-must_strip_normal,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:jura=rage,I am <i>not</i> a dungeon bot, or machine, or whatever it is you're implying.
5-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_losing=confident,Last countermeasure.
5-must_strip_losing=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:jura=rage,I am <i>not</i> a dungeon bot, or machine, or whatever it is you're implying.
5-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=frustrated,Well, sometimes a plan doesn’t survive engagement with the enemy.
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,notSaidMarker:twiceloss,priority:200,marker:twiceloss=rage,Wait, I lost twice in a row? What kind of... <i>Pod</i>, run an error check on the algorithm... Did I forget a bracket somewhere?
5-stripping=stripping,Usually this gets blown away by a big explosion. Then I die. So this is kind of an improvement.
5-stripping=stripping,It’s nice to take this off in a non-dramatic fashion, but I’m not thrilled that I’m losing my edge.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Oh, I've got a round or two left in me, Meia. Let me take off my, again, <i>tactical visor</i>.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:misato=stripping,My visor is used as a focal mount for most of my combat data. I wouldn't want too many optics built into my eyes, after all.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripping,Of course I'd have to take this off <i>eventually</i>, Rinkah, it's just more tactically useful than my boxers...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,Uh, unless you have class 41-S optical components, I think you'll find this frustrating, but I have a feeling wearing a blindfold isn't a new experience, Jura.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,Er, no, my <i>combat visor</i> is useful, but I can still win if I hang in there another round, Futaba.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripping,Finally, someone with taste and knowledge! It has radar, LI-dar, and other sensory apparatuses--
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:shimakaze,marker:shima_recon=stripping,Of course, Shimakaze. Good recon intel is critical to complete a mission against the machines with minimal casualties.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripping,Well, it is the hardpoint for most of my tactical data. It's easier for Pod to stream directly to it than my brain, you know?

-3-stripped=stripped,It’s not a blindfold, people. It’s a tactical visor. Only an idiot would walk around on the battlefield blind.
-3-stripped=stripped,It’s not a blindfold. My tactical visor was uh, helping me keep track of all your playstyles. This’ll be harder now.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripped,Huh. Well, thank you, Chun-Li!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Oh, you think I'm cute? Thanks! I’m glad you’re one of the first humans I met. You’re a bit strange, but you’re also very smart and entertaining. I’d work with you again in the future! Uh, maybe in a less... intimate setting, though.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=stripped,Oh. Huh. Well, thanks, Mahiru. I'll have my Pod do a data sync with yours after the game, I suppose. I think mine has higher fidelity.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,Sheesh. Here you go. You and 2B would get along like nobody's business, Meia.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-futaba:1=happy,I think we all get along really well, Pit! Thanks for great combat data, both of you.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stripped,Cheating's an incredibly harsh word. I don't say you're cheating when you use drunkenness as an excuse to flirt, do I?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,Thank you! Pit gets it! At least we get to reboot with our memories intact, right? It has to be hard for mere mortals. And uh, yes, I do have eyes. Why wouldn't <i>eye</i>?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,I mean, Rinkah, I saw you staring. You being distracted has more weight than me removing my visor.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripped,I see! An external connection to your command is very interesting. Do you ever worry about being hacked...? Or... maybe you like that risk?




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Okay, I think I’m starting to get ~name~’s playstyle. No hacking needed, just observation.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,This is it for ~name~, right? No more tricks!
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,Here comes the best part of the simulation!
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Too easy.
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Really, ~name~? Are you trying <i>at all</i>?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,Looks like you’re falling behind, ~name~. You going to keep up with me?
0-male_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,Looks like we’re cracking ~name~’s firewall. I wonder what countermeasures he’s got in store?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.

0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,Looks like we’re cracking ~name~’s firewall. I wonder what countermeasures he’s got in store?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,My lead’s growing, ~name~.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Okay, I think I’m starting to get ~name~’s playstyle. No hacking needed, just observation.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.
0-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,…
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Pit, huh? Are you human, or something else?
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=interested,(Hmm. Is there something going on between Pit and Annie? They seem so furtive.)
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,This is it for ~name~, right? No more tricks!
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,Here comes the best part of the simulation!
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Too easy.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Really, ~name~? Are you trying <i>at all</i>?
0-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=calm,Huh. Corrin again?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:prince=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,This isn’t your first loss, ~name~, but I don’t expect you diverge from pattern…
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,I’m not quite sure why this anticipation is so appealing, but I can’t wait to see what ~name~ takes off next!
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=interested,I’m interested to see what ~name~’s going to choose as her first play.
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,~name~’s first item. <i>Pod</i>, give me a character analysis based on norepinephrine and cortisol levels.
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,This is it!
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,~name~’s last item. I’m not thrilled I didn’t generate good data, but I’m still enjoying the rush of a clean win.
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Male YorHa models tend to either perform really well or really poorly. Not that ~name~’s playing badly but she’s over halfway done and I haven’t lost at all yet…
0-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,I wish 2B were here. She might be bored but she’d at least give me a challenge.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
0-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
0-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
0-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…
0-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.
0-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
0-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
0-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
0-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.

2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=calm,Huh. Corrin again?
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
2-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,~name~ is almost done. Without countermeasures he shouldn’t
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,This is it. ~name~ is officially out of defenses now.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,Time to catch up, ~name~.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,Finally. I was worried you’d manage to keep your win streak going.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,What’ve you got for us <i>this</i> time, ~name~?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=calm,You’re looking cold, ~name~. I guess this is the opposite of what you’d call a hot streak, huh?
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=rage,You know, ~name~, male YorHa models are supposed to be the advanced ones. You’re not really doing a lot for humanity or male androids if you’re playing so poorly.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,Huh. Most men tend to run out of countermeasures by now.
2-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,They say No.2 and No.9 units tend to be compatible as field partners. It’s a shame our item summary is surpassing nine. Okay, this is a contrived joke, but you’re starting to seem stressed, ~name~.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=calm,I’m not finished yet either, ~name~, but I’ve got a lot further to go. Thanks for the analysis.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,Win-loss ratio exceeding 2.00…
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=calm,Hm. What’s next for ~name~? <i>Pod</i> record this carefully. For… 21O’s metrics. Of course.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,We’re really close! I’m glad you’re putting up a good fight. That’s always a better way to generate combat data.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=confident,Well, plus or minus one piece, it looks like you’re also burning through your countermeasures.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,I should’ve taken you more seriously, ~name~.
2-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,You’re playing well, ~name~. I’m impressed.
2-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
2-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
2-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
2-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
2-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=happy,Win-loss ratio exceeding 2.00…
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=calm,Hm. What’s next for ~name~? <i>Pod</i> record this carefully. For… 21O’s metrics. Of course.
2-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=clever,They say No.2 and No.9 units tend to be compatible as field partners. It’s a shame our item summary is surpassing nine. Okay, this is a contrived joke, but you’re starting to seem stressed, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=calm,I’m not finished yet either, ~name~, but I’ve got a lot further to go. Thanks for the analysis.
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
2-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
2-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
2-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
2-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
2-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
2-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.
2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--

2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,You’re playing well, ~name~. I’m impressed.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,We’re really close! I’m glad you’re putting up a good fight. That’s always a better way to generate combat data.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=confident,Well, plus or minus one piece, it looks like you’re also burning through your countermeasures.

3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.

3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.

3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?

3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
3-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
3-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,Well, time for ~name~ to take a bow.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,That’s it for ~name~! I hope you can appreciate what I’m showing. I have a feeling I’m about to.
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=calm,If you want to stand a little closer, we can talk strategy, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,I’m not that far behind you, ~name~. I think I’ve generated pretty good data by now, so strip whatever you’d like.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,<i>Pod</i>, use the high-quality streaming for this. Uh. For better data analysis later.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=excited,Now that I’m pretty exposed, I’m quite a bit more interested in what you have to lose, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
3-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, ~name~, I’m surprised. I didn’t take you for a strategy-type! You’re playing really well!
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=happy,Some Scanner-types would be jealous that their data is so off prediction, but I just see this as a chance to learn more.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
3-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
3-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
3-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?

5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Pit, huh? Are you human, or something else?
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,It’s been fun, ~name~, but you should know I don’t give up when I’m backed into a corner.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=clever,Hm. Do you fold under pressure, ~name~?
5-male_must_strip,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,…
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=calm,Hm.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,Let’s get you caught up, ~name~.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=interested,I’m feeling a twinge of something, ~name~. I don’t think it’s jealousy… But it feels kind of like that?
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=calm,Oh, I haven’t forgotten about you, ~name~. You’ve been doing really well!
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=frustrated,I thought I’d be doing a little better than you, ~name~. I can admit that I’m wrong. You know, when I’m actually wrong.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,A Swan… Miraculous? Does the syntax on that statement make no sense to anyone else?
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=clever,A second loss from Pit, huh?
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=interested,Pit, huh? Are you human, or something else?
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:prince=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=interested,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=calm,I feel a little bad for you, Corrin.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,(I’m not so sure about the two of them together. They’re upbeat, at least.)
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,So, what’s next, Corrin? And please, try to be confident.
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i>
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=interested,(Hmm. Is there something going on between Pit and Annie? They seem so furtive.)
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,This has been fun, ~name~. But what’s next is your...
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:7=interested,Phew. Close match, ~name~.
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=calm,Huh. Corrin again?
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=interested,Ouch, Pit, are you just going to let her challenge you like that?
5-male_must_strip,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Corrin, you look like an android… But who is this Camilla of yours? Is she your Commander?
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,I’m not out yet, and this is just getting started.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,My visor and my eyes give me all the info I need for a comeback. You might be getting started, but this is far from over, ~name~!
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Enjoying the view, ~name~?
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,I still have my visor, and nothing else to lose. So you better watch out!
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,You’re not so far ahead that you can afford to get distracted, ~name~.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Keep going, ~name~. I’ve gotten the combat data I needed, this is just for me.
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,This is it!
5-female_human_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,That’s your last piece, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
5-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=happy,That’s what you call a weapon, ~name~?
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:virtual=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
5-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
5-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
5-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,I’m not out yet, and this is just getting started.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=clever,My visor and my eyes give me all the info I need for a come back. You might be getting started, but this is far from over, ~name~!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:video_game=clever,I’m all for games, but isn’t it a bit silly to project your desires onto pixels, ~player~?
5-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=interested,A superhero?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:shy=interested,No need to be shy, ~name~. We’re all here to have fun. Well, fun is variable to people but…
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=happy,This is it!
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:7=confident,That’s your last piece, right?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:overwatch=clever,You seem to know something about Tactical Visors, ~name~, but none of you bothered to bring one. That seems like a bad choice to me.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=interested,You’re not so far ahead that you can afford to get distracted, ~name~.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,Keep going, ~name~. I’ve gotten the combat data I needed, this is just for me.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=happy,Enjoying the view, ~name~?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=clever,I still have my visor, and nothing else to lose. So you better watch out!
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=interested,Humans are so strange…
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh no, here she goes again…
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
5-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
5-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
5-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
5-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=interested,Pod, why are you giving me warning feedback… She’s going to <i>fire</i>?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,Marinette… Whoa!  <i>Pod</i>, can you rescan her yo-yo?
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.

-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=interested,Hm. Wait--
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:rwby=frustrated,Transforming weapons, right? That seems like an impractical solution to just having a Pod and suspension technology…
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess=interested,A prince? Wait, really? A human that’s ordained to be above even other humans? That’s such a weird concept!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,<i>Pod</i>, run R070 this time.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=confident,Very handsome and well put together. Your designers should be proud!
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,“Uravity?”
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:2=calm,Hm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:2=interested,Alcohol? Is that like an E-drug for humans?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2=calm,Why would ~player~ be especially into--
-1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,You’re taking off your choker?
-1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:1=clever,Let's see what you've got, Monika. You're not quite as alone in here as you think you are.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:0=interested,You’re a bit strange, Alice, to say the least.
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Well, that seems obvious. What else can you do with--
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! I didn’t think I’d encounter another android here.
-1-female_must_strip,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=calm,Is your Pod uploading this to the Bunker too, Streaming-chan?
-1-female_must_strip,target:gifany,targetStage:0=frustrated,Uh.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. You’re definitely biological…
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:5=frustrated,Well, you skipped two perfectly viable small pieces, and…
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,Oh! This is interesting. You’re going in reverse order, aren’t you Ms…
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=interested,You said you didn’t wear a bra to this, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, why aren’t you scanning Kyu?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,Your equipment seems a little outdated, but pretty clever.
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:4=interested,Magic? Um.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meg,targetStage:0=interested,What are these “serial killers” you keep talking about, Meg?
-1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well aren’t you charming, Revy.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4=happy,<i>Pod,</i> scan Marinette’s earrings this time. And Marinette, is this Tikki you mentioned some sort of artificial intelligence?
-1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=frustrated,I have a thing against "becoming as gods," Palutena. I hope you don’t mind if I take this opportunity to get some good data on archaic religious figures, at least.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:5=confident,It’s kind of sentimental, but I usually give Pod-153 a fist bump… When it does something cool. I know it’s not a particularly intimate form of gratitude, but I’m enjoying this loss of yours.
-1-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,You don’t talk…?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:6=excited,Marinette, what other types of Miraculous are there? How does the cat differ from the ladybug, for instance?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=clever,Your “costume” reminded me of something you’d see at a carnival.
-1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=calm,White hair and red eyes… Did you catch a logic virus before backing up your data, Rinkah?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=clever,Your tactical visor must be one of the older models that feeds right into your optic nerve.
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=calm,Saki… Hm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=confident,Are you one of those women who uses vintage casing for its own sake?
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Saki, you’re sort of out of your element, aren’t you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:5=calm,And that should be it, assuming your wings stay attached, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Hm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=interested,You're very clearly a woman dressed like a man. How... curious.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=clever,Cool, aloof, keen… Uses a combat visor.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=interested,That’s an interesting jacket… But, anyway, like we were talking about before you lost this hand…
-1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. You know, Revy, I take back what I said earlier.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to--
-1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:0=clever,Hm. Healing stream technology? Based on the energy signatures from your armor, anyway.
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger=excited,What bright red hair! Usually it’s far more muted, or synthetic looking, like with the Devola and Popola-class models. Very handsome, ~name~.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:1=interested,Alice is definitely biological, but…
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,Huh. I like the black and white contrast.
-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:confident=happy,Oh, someone is certainly confident. I like the enthusiasm!
-1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=interested,Hm... You know, Zizou, I bet you could use those Tres crystals kind of like a blackbox.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ann,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. I’m reading here you’re a model, but it doesn’t give a designation, Ann.
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:4=confident,Oh, don't hold up. She's going to get attacked this round, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=happy,Meia, again!
-1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=confident,Zizou, are you familiar with dodging attacks from a lot of angles?
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Huh? Are you not going to take off that chip in your hair, Chiaki?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=interested,Zizou…
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:2=interested,So what kind of Androids have you met, Videl?
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:3=happy,That jacket has a lot of sentimental value, but a lot of your dialogue focuses on those thigh-highs. Or “thights” as you endearingly refer.
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=calm,You're getting the hang of it, Corrin. I don't imagine anyone's actually bothered except you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,At YorHa we usually use nanofabrication to repair bodily harm.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:2=interested,I think we’ve gotten off to a bad start, Futaba.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:1=frustrated,I was thinking about your earlier questions, Futaba, and no, I’m not a <i>machine or robot</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:1=calm,You’re joking. You can’t expect me to believe you’ve figured out a way to onboard an A140:Gravity program into your body.
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=interested,Huh.
-1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re lucky I don’t just hack you, ~name~. Not that it would be terribly polite, but it’d be a lot faster.
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Talk about perfect timing, looks like the Scounter program’s ready!
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm,Hm… Wow, humans really are special.
-1-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0,marker:va_designate=interested,You’re a professional gamer… D.Va? What’s the syntax on .Va designations?
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:6=excited,Corrin’s last piece! I’m feeling somewhat conflicted.
-1-female_must_strip,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, I haven’t had a chance to run this program before, but I get the feeling now’s the right time.
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,You put up a brave face, but you’re really kind of troubled to be here, aren’t you, Corrin?
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=interested,Huh. Those have to be really flexible and evasive.
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=confident,Are you getting distracted, Meia?
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,WCS?




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_accessory=happy,This is kinda fun, playing without the algorithm.
male_removed_accessory=frustrated,Okay, my Pod should’ve rebooted right now.
female_removing_accessory=calm,Well, I suppose your ~clothing~ will be fine while Pod reboots.
female_removed_accessory=interested,I’m not used to operating without uh… Some insight.


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=happy,You came fully armored… You’re awful at this, ~name~.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,And without a scratch on me.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=clever,Saving a little tease for the ladies, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=confident,Wow, you’ve really been hanging on to that, huh, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,Good pacing, ~name~. I think. You’re trying to take a loss, but not show too much yet, right?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,<i>Pod</i>, add his ~clothing~ into the behavior algorithm. No, not the xenomapped ligase… The <i>other</i> XML.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,A reasonable start. Nothing too personal, nothing too covering. Good play, ~name~!
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,Hmm. That’s I figured you’d ante your ~clothing~, ~name~.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6,totalMales:5=clever,Saving a little tease for the ladies, ~name~? Uh, if there were any here. Kinda weird that it’s all guys…
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
0-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,Yeah, yeah. Let’s keep going.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,Not bad, ~name~. Don’t overthink it.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,You’re falling behind, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=calm,9S to Operator 21O to report status. ~name~: Two losses, 9S: 0.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,A game like this is no fun if you don’t take it seriously, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,I’d probably save my visor for last. Though I don’t think your ~clothing~ is a real tactical advantage, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Nothing left to lose now, ~name~. May as well fold.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=interested,Now that I can see all of you, I’m honestly amazed. You saved an accessory for last, but I haven’t lost at all yet. You’re weird, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
0-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,Usually androids in the Bunker try out Old Earth accessories, but they’re usually the first thing that they remove when getting to work. To be fair, you haven’t really started working, ~name~.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=rage,So not only are you playing poorly, but you’re not going to remove bigger pieces?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,~Clothing~? That’s a reasonable start.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, starting small, ~name~. For a first play, that seems to fit the model.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=calm,It’s still early, so your ~clothing~ seems like a fine choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,~name~’s slowing it down a little bit. If I were losing, I might consider that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,That must be important to you, to save it even after everything, and while you’re doing so badly...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=calm,Well, I can’t really complain about holdout apparel, given that you’ve somehow lost eight times before I even lost once.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,I wonder if you’d like a blue ribbon or a pink ribbon… Hm...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,I’m only a little ahead of you now, ~name~. Let’s see what you’ve got!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,I wonder if this is going to shape up your strategy moving forward. I’m going to guess no, though.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,It’s hard to play against a Scanner type.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=calm,Huh, I see. So when a male holds onto an item, it’s mostly because they were trying to get naked. But with females, it’s supposed to be for display.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,To be honest, while you weren’t great competition, I’m enjoying looking at all of you. Uh, you know. Androids can appreciate this kind of too.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,It has to be pretty hard to lose so many times without having gotten a single item off of someone, so it’s okay to try and save some dignity.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,Oh, come on. You just took off your ~clothing~, and this late in the game. <i>Pod</i>, let me get started on my report. This is going nowhere.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
0-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.

1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,I’m kind of amazed you held onto that.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=interested,I wonder if 21O would like it if I wore something like that…
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,Okay, so he doesn’t want to get to the good parts yet. Not a bad strategy.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,You know, I don’t really mind the small stuff, ~name~. Let’s keep going, though.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=frustrated,I could still see you wearing that but I’d expected it to just stay on as you lost…
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,I expected I’d like this more if a female model had held onto their ~clothing~ even after exposing everything else…
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.

1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=clever,It’s a start, at least.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?

1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,There we go. Now we’re even, but don’t think I’m going to go easy on you.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,I hope you enjoyed being ahead while you had the chance.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=clever,Yeah, yeah. Get on with it.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=rage,Are you just trying to mock me?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=clever,That was an interesting idea, holding onto that for last.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=calm,I don’t really have a lot of sentimental items. It’s hard to account for emotionality, I suppose.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,Even for a Scanner model, I must be pretty good at this.
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,Nothing to report here.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
1-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Huh. I think there’s something in my records about this. Are you doing a striptease, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=frustrated,This doesn’t make a lot of tactical sense but it’s definitely doing something for me…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Wait, you’re <i>still</i> holding onto something like that?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=interested,Wouldn’t it make more sense to have taken that off earlier, ~name~? Why did you keep it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,Ah, ~clothing~. You’re still on the small stuff too, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,You’re still doing pretty well, ~name~!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,~Clothing~. That’s a fair opening move. Kind of derivative, though…
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,Looks like we’re going to be even now, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,That’s that, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=clever,Saving your ~clothing~ for last seems like a striptease to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,If I were in your shoes, or uh, lack thereof, I’d try and delay until I got some help too.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=interested,You held onto your ~clothing~ for that long, but you’re still so exposed... <i>Pod</i>, adjust depth of field on ~name~, I don’t want her to catch me off guard.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,What a pain. I’m not going to just let you win, but do you really have to have so many diversions?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,So that’s going to be your last accessory, right? The rest of the stuff doesn’t count, does it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,We’re tied for now, ~name~. But that’ll change soon.
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=confident,I know it took a little bit to warm up, but now you’ll see what a top of the line YorHa scanner model can do.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.


#lost boots
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:8=frustrated,That has to have some sort of sentimental value to you for you to have brought it and kept it for so long.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,I’ve heard of stripteases, but isn’t hat something women are supposed to do?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=interested,I wonder if you’re taking it easy on me.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=rage,What kind of nonsense is this?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,You know, at this point, shouldn’t you be running out of accessories, ~name~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,Yeah, yeah.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,That’s a reasonably smart start.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,I wish you’d started with something bigger.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Well, it seemed… Cool while you had it, ~name~.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=interested,It seems to be working on me when you do it, ~name~.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,You’re worse than 2B at cards. She always just says the game is stupid. I’ve lost nothing and you’re… This is odd.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,I’ve seen Machine Lifeforms with more sense than you.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=happy,Why’d you keep that ~clothing~ around for so long anyway? Sentimental value?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,Now that you’re out of trinkets, ~name~, let’s see if you can’t form up a better defense.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,Hopefully that’ll be the first of many.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=frustrated,Okay, not a bad first choice, but a little
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=clever,I wonder if some sudden urge came over you to keep your ~clothing~ on… It’s not great tactical sense, but it is confusing… <i>Pod</i>, add this play to the Misdirection Tactics file.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Hm. Did you forget you had your ~clothing~, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...

2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=rage,Oh come on, if you’re going to throw the game, don’t be insulting, ~name~.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,Is this because I took my boots off instead of my coat? <i>Whoosh</i> my model did not account for forgetfulness.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!

2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=frustrated,Well, the point of this game was to get encounter data… I’m just <i>vexed</i> that this is your first play.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=confident,I’m impressed, ~name~. You’re generating a lot of good metrics, and putting up a great challenge!
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,You’re no 2B, but we’d make a pretty good team, ~name~.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=excited,We’re neck and neck, and following a similar order… Do you also have something big next, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?

2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.

2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=calm,Well, you look cute, ~name~. Not that you didn’t before...
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=frustrated,Yeah, yeah. Very clever. Let’s keep on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,I mean, we’re performing at approximately the same level. It’s a compliment, trust me.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,Though I <i>am</i> interested in whatever you have next.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=clever,Huh. Okay then. At least we can enjoy the view?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,It happens to the best of us. Sometimes, I forget to take my visor off before I sleep, to be honest.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,Something bigger would be nice, but I can hardly blame you for that first play.
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,Gloves <i>and</i> boots for <i>~clothing~</i>. That seems fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.

3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,So you saved your ~clothing~ for the very end of the game?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,I think maybe I’ll hold onto my visor for last, just to try it out.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Starting small?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=happy,Well, I’m far from out myself… Making it a challenge?
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Hm. <i>Pod</i>, make note of stalling tactics.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=confident,Well, ~name~, saving your small stuff for last is… Maybe not the worst idea.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,I wonder if I could’ve brought Cruel Oath and treated it as an accessory.
3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,That’s not exactly sending shockwaves my way.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,Hm. You look <i>much</i> better without that.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=confident,You’re easy on the eyes, ~name~. Under the visor and all.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=rage,I know I’m not that far behind you, but did you really need to hold onto something like that for so long?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,Yeah, yeah. Let’s keep going to the good stuff.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,Keep playing like that, ~name~, and I don’t even need predictive data to win.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=happy,This is close, ~name~. I’m going to have to refactor your risk index…
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,At least you didn’t remove a limb, I’ve seen machine lifeforms try to emulate this game and… It has odd results.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=confident,If that’s your first move, ~name~, I think we’re in for a long game.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.

3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=frustrated,<i>Pod</i>, does the algorithm account for-- Oh, it does account for my own state of undress.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,That’s… A play you can make.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hm. <i>Pod,</i> can you stream something more interesting to my visor? There’ve been better plays already.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your ~clothing~’s quite cute, but I think a nice ribbon works just as well.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=happy,Well, it’s a bit late in the game, but at least you’re trying, ~name~.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,Hm. I think most people would’ve rather you taken something off something bigger.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,Are you checking out my chest, ~name~?
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=excited,Did you hold onto that because… I’m this exposed? To make a point? Or to stand with me?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=interested,Holding onto your ~clothing~ this late, ~name~? Huh. I guess it buys you time, at least.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,Oh, I see. ~name~ held onto her ~clothing~ as a backup measure. Not really what I wanted to see about now, but it’s good tactical sense.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Well, now we can see all of you, ~name~. Well, all but one part...
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,It’s strange, but I’m actually finding the appeal of saving your ~clothing~ for last. It adds… Something extra.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=happy,<i>Pod</i>, make a note that ~name~’s playing well. Let’s implement some of her strategy next play.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=excited,<i>Pod</i>, ~name~’s score is close to mine, but she came with more countermeasures. Make a note to bring more next time.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,It would’ve been nice to see more, but I guess I’ll just have to keep up the play.
3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm. Smart first play, but uh, maybe I should’ve played a little better if that’s all you’re taking off.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!


#lost shorts
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Huh, I guess saving an accessory for last means it can be a distraction… Or a final hidden play.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=frustrated,I’ve seen you wearing your ~clothing~, but I suppose I was just expected you to keep it on...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,Well, you <i>are</i> winning. Maybe there’s a lesson here rather than something to be frustrated about.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=clever,Even though I’m down to two layers, you had something so small for your first play? You’re really into winning, ~name~.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.

4-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?

4-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,Statistically, this <i>should</i> be your last extra piece.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?

4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=confident,Even though you’ve still got your weakest pieces, I still think we’ll see more from you before this is over.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=calm,Yeah yeah, let’s keep going. I’m not trying to rush, just want to keep playing.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,Would you mind helping me regulate my model after this?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=frustrated,Hm. I wish I’d thought of that. I guess humans just have a good grasp on this kind of thing.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
4-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=happy,For the Glory of Mankind is supposed to be our motto in YorHa.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,My exocortex is on fire right now. Why am I feeling all these weird emotions?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=clever,Wow, for some reason having your ~clothing~ last is really quite pleasing!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=happy,It’s contrary to the expected order, but it's very exciting that you've kept your ~clothing~ on, even if you're exposing your other primary vulnerabilities.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,I can respect a better player, but part of me wishes there was more to see.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your ~clothing~ isn't a bad choice at all. Here's hoping it's the first of many!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=interested,All things considered, this could be worse.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,I should've played better if all name has to remove is...That.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. I never really understood why such accessories were so popular among the female androids...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,Well, one countermeasure down.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=confident,It’s a start. And a start is all I need.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,Well, good to see you get into it, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=interested,Well, this has been enjoyable, ~name~.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,So, this is what you look like in full behind all the countermeasures, with no augmentation? It’s… very striking!
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=interested,It seems almost rude to watch you scrounge for spare parts when I'm like this.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,Hm. I wonder if 21O would like something like that… Or maybe 2B...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
4-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?

4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.

5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=excited,Hm. A late stage play with your ~clothing~...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=confident,Your ~clothing~ isn’t your first and it’s not going to be your last, ~name~!
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your ~clothing~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=clever,You’re still in the early stages, ~name~, so it follows trend data that you’d still have countermeasures like your ~clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Not what I’d have liked you to pick, but you’re the one that’s winning...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=clever,Are you just trying to show off, ~name~? Your ~clothing~ doesn’t show much.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
5-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=rage,Argh, I hate to lose. I’m supposed to be a shining example of a YorHa Scanner, and you’re overwhelming me so readily, ~name~.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=interested,I hope most of your processing power was reserved for your ~clothing~, ~name~, and we can start seeing bigger losses.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=calm,I guess there’s something to be said about playing accessories early.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=excited,Well, one more thing down. I hope it isn’t the last.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=calm,I’m enjoying the look, ~name~!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=happy,Let’s keep going. No need to “yeah yeah” you when you’re positioned like you are. In the game, I mean.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=confident,I’m glad you’re keeping this so interesting!
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Though, I’m really liking this whole “completely unarmored” look.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
5-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,You really brought me around on saving something small like your ~clothing~ for last.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:7=interested,So, Pod finally sent the old information, this is what you’d call a “strip tease,” right, ~name~?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=interested,Okay, that’s an early play.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3=happy,Well, one more down, at least.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.

5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=frustrated,I can’t believe you’re so far ahead, ~name~. Your first loss, and an accessory?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0=rage,What? ~name~? Were you running some kind of stealth program? I can’t believe you’ve only lost one item.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=clever,Your ~clothing~? Oh, come on, ~name~, don’t just drag this out!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:4-6=calm,Well, it’s not that your ~clothing~ isn’t impressive…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?

5-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?

5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.

5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.

5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?

5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!

5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=interested,I don’t suppose you’d be willing to uh, take off more?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:2-4=clever,I’m certainly less dressed, but if all you’re taking off is ~clothing~, can you really say you’re better dressed?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=clever,Your ~clothing~ was… A little impressive, considering that you’re so far ahead.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1=happy,You’re really impressive, ~name~, even if that was a first loss.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=excited,It’s just that you’re so distinct.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5-7=excited,The rest of you just stands out so much more!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=happy,Anyway, it has… Definitely had a profound effect on my model moving forward.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:8=excited,I mean, I’m doing that with my visor, kind of. It just… Uh, happens to be more functional.
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
5-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?

-3-male_removing_accessory=clever,Your ~clothing~? That’s a pretty common accessory, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory=calm,Oh, ~clothing~. It’s not big, if you want help.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-3-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
-3-male_removed_accessory=happy,Well, you lost your ~clothing~, but I have a feeling the frustration people are experiencing will pass soon.
-3-male_removed_accessory=confident,This has definitely been a fun experience.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=confident,Hm… You are <i>fascinating</i>, Pit!
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-3-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removing_accessory=interested,Her ~clothing~? Nice choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory=happy,Something small? Yeah, yeah. It’s still cute though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-3-female_removed_accessory=confident,Well, fair’s fair. I’m excited to see just a <i>bit</i> more of you.
-3-female_removed_accessory=clever,So isn’t that an Old World custom, where someone else takes off small bits of ~name~’s clothing with their teeth? I… Could be persuaded.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?

-2-male_removing_accessory=interested,Well, it’s one step closer to getting you fully exposed, ~name~.
-2-male_removing_accessory=confident,Oh, your ~clothing~? Well, I’m sure you can be creative with how it comes off...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-2-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-2-male_removed_accessory=confident,You seem a bit lost, ~name~. Here’s a tip: Big stuff, then follow my lead.
-2-male_removed_accessory=happy,Okay, what’s next, ~name~?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,This is… Kind of frustrating. The data is really interesting, though.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=clever,Anyway, a long flowing cape certainly holds an appeal, but don’t you worry about it being caught in battle?
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!

-2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?

-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=confident,I’ll enjoy matching wits against you, Pit! If the commentary from the Bunker is to believed, I think others would like to see us match… Oh, uh, huh, you know, let’s just keep going.
-2-male_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?

-2-female_removing_accessory=frustrated,I could use a bit more support than your ~clothing~, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-2-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
-2-female_removed_accessory=interested,2B’s better at taking care of small stuff… Hacking tends to be a one-size approach.
-2-female_removed_accessory=confident,Something bigger’s next, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
-2-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.

-1-male_removing_accessory=happy,~Clothing~ from ~name~? Hmm.
-1-male_removing_accessory=clever,I bet you’ll be wanting that back, right? I wouldn’t mind a little souvenir, ~name~.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=interested,If you don’t want to play, why don’t you stop? Come on.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. You seem clever, at least.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=frustrated,Really?
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=interested,Wait, am I saying that right? Pit? Or is it P-It. I’ve met a few androids with that designation.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=confident,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a male-type operator before...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Hades? Ha-Des? What kind of machine lifeform is that?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=interested,So you don’t want to become as gods, Pit? Thank goodness! I would hate for you to do something reckless!
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...

-1-male_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re certainly very polite, but Camilla seems like a slave driver. Yeesh. Making you strip naked in front of strangers?
-1-male_removed_accessory=happy,Well, it’s not much but it’s something to cover up with, anyway.
-1-male_removed_accessory=frustrated,Why’d you bring your ~clothing~ to a simulation like this anyway? Just to pad your countermeasures?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.

-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=rage,Mettaton is such an offensive stereotype I don’t even know where to begin!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pit_sacrifice=frustrated,Uh. If we could focus on the game and not sacrifices, I’d be a lot happier.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.

-1-female_removing_accessory=happy,Well, it’s small, but if it’s anything like a blackbox or machine core, big things can come in small devices.
-1-female_removing_accessory=confident,I’m <i>really</i> impressed you’ve managed to keep your ~clothing~ for this long, ~name~!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=calm,You metabolize that very strangely… I never understood the appeal of getting disoriented. Well, the metabolic data you’re generating should be interesting, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=calm,Are you some kind of combat model?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=interested,I mean, your pod. You're using an oversized optical lens and no antigrav circuits...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=interested,Oh, I know your antenna are black, Shimakaze. I meant as an accessory! Lots of female androids use ribbons and bows. At YorHa, anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=interested,No… Most YorHa models tend to have lighter skin. Hm.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,You’re pretty clever, but you’re kind of mean for no reason... Or is there a reason?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=clever,That thing’s loaded with potential energy. Do you just swing that around, or does it serve some other purpose?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=calm,That seems a lot like my hacking.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=happy,Hm. She has a high concentration of potential energy in her.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=frustrated,Oh, you’re saving <i>that</i> for last?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,<i>Pod</i>, what are these brain wave readings you’re sending my way?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=clever,<i>Pod,</i>, run A1999: Scounter.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=interested,You remind me of partner, Meia. Her name is 2B.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=rage,H-hey! What the hell!? I didn't realize you had hacking capability, Monika... I'm keeping an eye on you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=calm,Do they just take serial numbers off a body? Or do they delete ID information?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,Though I think the whole “carrying lots of gear around in pockets” strategy is centuries out of date. Why doesn’t your armor have compartments?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=clever,What could be so bulky you need pockets to carry it around?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=excited,It says…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=interested,Okay. This is really unnerving... The only nonverbal things I've met that move like that have been machines...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=interested,I can feel pain, but it’s all synthetic. Processing injury reduces overall cost, says the Commander.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confident,Slowing down a little bit, Shimakaze? I don't blame you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,And you keep your Pod on your head. How cute. Though…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=clever,Uh, no, Ochako, I think these “Quirks” you’re talking about are probably more positive than WCS.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=frustrated,I can’t seem to link to the data repository if so, but I found something on the intranet…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,But it had some interesting energy fluctuations. Even among YorHa units, you don’t usually see that kind of thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=clever,As in, upside down gravity? The Japanese language asset was lost a long time ago, but I’ve picked up a bit here and there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,We use external Pods because of risks to our blackbox. Though if you’re a human…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=interested,That’s quite outdated, isn’t it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did you just call in some sort of artillery support to remove your clothing?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=happy,I guess my YorHa background is showing, isn’t it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-mean:1=confident,Even though some of the players are kind of mean, that’s no reason to just roll over and take their abuse. Fight back!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,count-kind:1-3=happy,The good news is that the other players aren’t here to shame you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=calm,You kind of act like a machine trying to parse through old human information.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,How strange. I just can’t quite pin down her brainwaves. Has she lost her mind?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,<i>Purple</i> hair? I had to check my visor's color input for a second.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:purple_hair,priority:80=interested,Huh. <i>Purple</i> is kind of synthesize, let alone color hair pigment. Maybe that's why royalty was so sensitive about it in human history...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:1=frustrated,Really? I think I must have bugged this program into other simulation.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=clever,<i>Pink</i> hair? Wow! I haven't seen that on a human before. Some of the Operator models like to add a little dye to their hair to get that tone, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? I haven't seen a female-type operator with your eye color before...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:pink_hair,priority:80=interested,Wait, ~name~, are you an Operator model...? You're playing how I'd imagine 21O would.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=frustrated,I thought I fixed this bug... Is this supposed to happen to her?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,I have to say! I really like red hair! Especially that natural coppery hue. The Devola and Popola models can get a little vibrant.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:ginger,priority:80=interested,Say, are you any good with music, ~name~? I know the Devola and Popola models are pretty great musicians, and your hair's close to theirs.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=clever,I guess we’ll see how you do here, Miss Song.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Green hair...? Looks kind of toxic, ~name~. Most organic toxins and corrosives don't really affect me, though...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:green_hair,priority:80=frustrated,I feel like I'm underdressed. ~name~'s ~clothing~... ~name~'s green hair...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=frustrated,What do you mean she’s not showing up?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. I’d rather keep mine on.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Looks like we're balanced, ~name~. You've got black hair, I've got white...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:black_hair,priority:80=interested,Black hair, huh? I think that'd be a little too much for me with my outfit... Though, maybe black hair and a white outfit...? Like your ~clothing~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,Hm. Your ~clothing~ isn't really worth commenting on, but blonde hair's kinda rare, right? I'm not seeing any chemical damage in the follicle structure, at least.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,I'd talk about your ~clothing~, ~name~,  but it's kind of... boring. Your hair though; it's interesting to see that your genetic stock is actually pretty clean!
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blonde,priority:80=clever,You know, blonde hair is pretty recessive, right, ~name~? You must be from a really specific background.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=confident,I think you’re going to be safe here. Just relax and enjoy the company.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:exotic_hair,priority:80=interested,Your ~clothing~'s not nearly as interesting at whatever's going on with your hair, huh, ~name~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=calm,I actually know a few non-YorHa androids with blue hair. I guess it's common on Old Earth too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:blue_hair,priority:80=frustrated,It's weird, the gene for blue hair seems so prevalent, but so strange. Shouldn't most of you have some shade of brown, ~name~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=calm,But I’m fortunate to see two models here. Are you prototypes, or something else? Nugi-chan’s designs seem more like YorHa than Streaming’s.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,~Clothing~... I mean, it's typical for this stage, but it's not interesting. Brunette hair is also pretty plain too... guess I'll just update my log.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:brunette,priority:80=calm,What to talk about... Sorry, ~name~, your ~clothing~ and your physical appearance are pretty... mundane as far as data analysis goes.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=happy,I’m an android. I apologize if my implication was rude, just that the model I'm building doesn’t really account for those with unusual mindsets.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:0=interested,9S to Bunker… We have a problem with this game...
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested,Hm. I can think of a few battle models who’d look good in ~clothing~ like ~name~’s.
-1-female_removed_accessory=clever,~Clothing~’s off to you, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1,marker:chan_designate=clever,I don’t think I’ve met many “-chan” designated models before.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=happy,Well... I'm sure there's a design paradigm that wouldn't mess with your reception. Unless you really like the black ribbon. I have to say, I like black a lot, it's just weird seeing it on a non-YorHa android, to be honest!
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:medium_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Just your ~clothing~... And your hair's kind of middle-ground, ~name~. It reminds me of 2B. Which is... a little weird, but a little nice?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=confident,Oh! I’m sorry! I’ll be a bit more clear… Next time.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=happy,This game sure digs up a lot of history.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=clever,What hurtful words? I’m sorry if I implied you don’t exist.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=confident,I’m certainly grateful I get backed up at the Bunker, either way. It seems kinda… Deviant behavior.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=frustrated,Oh, sorry, Shimakaze. I know I'd get annoyed if someone was critical of my analytical skills.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,She’s also kind of a stoic pain in the neck. But I wouldn’t have anyone else by my side.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,Creation, huh? How interesting.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=confident,Sorry, I'm just more interested in your technology and motives than your apparel... but ask me again when you're a bit more exposed... I can't see under your clothes, after all! That'd be cheating!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=clever,Short hair may not look as elegant in combat, but it's very simple, huh, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:short_hair,priority:80=confident,I like short hair. It turns out hair length was a big design problem at YorHa! Scanner types get too overheated with long hair, it turns out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=clever,That seems a little dangerous... but I'm glad it seems to be localized on you. You've got a pretty durable design, don't you, Shimakaze?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=frustrated,(Two can play at this game. Just you wait, Monika dot chr...)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is Neo actually human? Or some sort of simulated Machine Lifeform? I don’t want to deal with another Adam or Eve for a long time.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=calm,Is she just some sort of shared hallucination?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=frustrated,Uh, no thanks. There’s certain materials that are incompatible with android physiology. Like mackerel, for instance.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=frustrated,YorHa’s tried to develop morale-busting programs for the machines. Maybe you know something we don’t.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=clever,Are you so competitive you’re just trying to… Oh! I get it. You’re trying to distract everyone else.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, they’re scan proof. That’s really dangerous technology, Sei, but very interesting!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=clever,I’ll have to do more research into this “Flame Tribe” of yours.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=interested,I think your hair looks... really interesting, ~name~. It reminds me a bit of an older type of combat model...
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:very_long_hair,priority:80=clever,Long hair looks a lot better in battle, but it also has to be functional. Most A-units actually have pressure sensors along their hair that lets them adjust rapidly to combat feedback!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=calm,Hrm… Start compiling her personality profile. This is strange. Oh, uh, nothing to worry about Saki.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=frustrated,But with Humanity on the moon, how much do we really need to worry about materials when we can scavenge from Earth…?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gifany,targetStage:1=rage,I’m detecting .GIFany is over 90% corrupted by a logic virus. What do you mean I can’t terminate?
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=confident,Interesting, no hair? Is that by design or are you just kinda clumsy, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:bald,priority:80=frustrated,Hm. Well, now's a good time to talk about your lack of hair, right, ~name~? Since your ~clothing~ isn't anything to write home about...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=confident,The way you think matters a lot for persona based data, so I want to make sure it’s accurate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Which is magic of its own, I’ll have you know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=excited,I guess the Old World called that type of particle manipulation magic. That'd make her a witch in this simulation, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=frustrated,Huh. The results are inconclusive.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=interested,Whoa, did Vriska steal your powers, Marinette? Or just the costume? Or is this a common thing?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=confident,What does it say about Videl’s power level… Hm. This might take a bit for it to boot and install… Anyway, not a terrible first play, Videl.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=calm,O-oh. You aren’t an android at all. Um. Go ahead and uh, carry on with what you’re doing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=calm,Huh. Did she steal your powers, Marinette? I mean, she's clearly doing better...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=clever,Huh. That probability manipulator copied Marinette's suit. Weirdly appropriate.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:chainsawsword=happy,You made the right choice not bringing your weapon, Corrin! After all, I left my sword at the Bunker!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=confident,Say, you are human, aren’t you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=frustrated,Well, I hope she finds it. A sharp intellect is pretty important for games of probability like this.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You <i>could</i> probably integrate it into your suit. No?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=happy,Stripes though! How interesting, and useful as optical camouflage.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=happy,There we are. <i>Pod</i>, finish diagnostic scan of the Inventory environment. I'm not here to spar.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=interested,How do you run a Pod program with no external unit? To float like that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:3=clever,Humans have such odd fetishes.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=happy,Those gloves have a nervous interface… Huh. Are you a pilot too, D.Va?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,The model isn’t perfect, but it worked out pretty well until the end!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=interested,Material analysis indicates... Sarasalloy? Wow! That's a really rare metal! And uh, yeah! They're pretty.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=happy,Your ~clothing~? It's not nearly as interesting as how long your hair is! You must look incredible in motion.
-1-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:1-3,filter:long_hair,priority:80=frustrated,Does your hair ever get in the way of stuff, ~name~? It's pretty long, so without an extrasensory node, it seems kind of intrusive.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=confident,Maybe… WCS and Quirks are two possible outcomes? This simulation sure posits some interesting theories… I guess that’s the goal of fiction, though.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,(Pod, check that response against her heart rate and alpha-pattern. She’s so interesting to study!)

0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=confident,Not a bad first choice. Everyone’s endorphins are rising.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=excited,Your ~clothing~? Bold choice.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Okay, so first you lost your… Hmm… And now you’re taking off your ~clothing~... <i>Pod</i>, add this to the algorithm.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,Oh! That’s not bad.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=calm,Scanner types are great at lots of stuff. But my specialty is combat data. You’re not putting up much of a fight, ~name~.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,If you really want to win, ~name~, you’re going to have to be less predictable.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=clever,This is it, isn’t it? Everything’s out there already, but I’m sure you had a reason to save your ~clothing~ for last.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=confident,I think getting almost naked and saving your ~clothing~ for last was a neat trick, but distracting the group with everything else clearly didn’t work. I’m still at full strength.
0-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
0-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=confident,I’m not going to hack into your loadout, ~name~. But if I were you, I’d add some Reset chips to your stack next game.
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=calm,You didn’t even get me to lose once, ~name~. I’m a little uncomfortable with not understanding why.
0-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
0-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!

0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=clever,That’s not a bad piece to give up
0-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Everything that lives is designed to end. Hopefully your loss streak is the same.

0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
0-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?

0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,hough I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
0-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!

0-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=interested,Huh. I’d have expected either something bigger or smaller, but considering you’re already basically naked...
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,What a strange last item, ~name~... You’re really making me question what exactly your goals here today were…
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,That’s pretty predictable given how much you’ve already lost.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,Ah, hold on, ~name~! My visor tracking desynced for a second. I need to observe this carefully. I hate it when stuff gets fragmented.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,That isn’t a bad choice for early, but you’re still a little behind, ~name~.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,I’m not ahead by a huge margin, but it’s good to see you’re keeping with the spirit of the game, ~name~. This is great data.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,Oh! That’s bigger than I expected.
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=excited,~name~ is taking off her ~clothing~? First? Huh!
0-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=clever,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
0-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
0-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=frustrated,It’s nice to see you naked and to be winning and all, but you’re really throwing a wrench in my predictive model.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,Well, I’m not quite sure why you showed off your important stuff but saved that for last. But I suppose if you don’t have fun, there’s not a lot of good in doing it, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,Okay, so you’re almost done now. I’m surprised you waited this long to remove that.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=confident,We’re really getting down to it. Well, <i>you’re</i> really getting down to it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,Interesting first choice!
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=happy,I think your ~clothing~ was a good initial ante, especially when we’re so close in score. I’m happy to see where this goes, ~name~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,Yeah, yeah. Okay, what’s next?
0-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,You keep losing, ~name~. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.

1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
1-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.


#lost boots
2-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,Wrapping things up, huh, ~name~?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,<i>Pod</i>, take a study of that item. I want to make a heuristic for future encounters of this type.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,Looks like we’re finally working our way through ~name~’s bigger objects. More to go, though.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,That’s a pretty big series of losses, ~name~.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, that seems like a reasonable start.
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Yeah, yeah. Catch up, will you?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,Just ~clothing~?
2-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=confident,I knew you were playing poorly, but saving something like your ~clothing~ for last?
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=frustrated,I’m still not understanding why some people save their minor clothing until the very last.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=excited,Well, that’s just about it for you, ~name~. Now that you’re fully exposed, are you going to fight back, or fold?
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=confident,Even a Scanner type can appreciate a good contest.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,9S to Bunker. ~name~ has removed a minor countermeasure after I’ve removed my gloves and boots.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=calm,This is going to take a while. At least you’re making good progress.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,Okay, ~name~, what’s left?
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Yeah, yeah. Let’s see what else you’ve got.
2-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,Smaller than I’d have liked, but a reasonable first play.
2-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
2-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
2-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,~Clothing~? Huh. That definitely makes me feel better about these projections…
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Not exactly breaking the mold with your ~clothing~.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,<i>Pod</i>, make note that ~name~’s strategy is typical. And a losing one.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,It’s not as big as I’d like-- Uh, as big as generates useful data.
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=confident,
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,Well, you’ve been showing off everything else, so despite getting me down to my coat, your efforts to sabotage my analysis hasn’t worked...
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,That’s a weird first choice, but it’s weirder that I’m losing...
2-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. You’re following my lead, huh, ~name~?
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,hough I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=clever,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Not too out there, so let’s see what next.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=confident,It’s still early. Plenty of time for a comeback.
2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,Well, that’s pretty typical for uh, how both of us are doing.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Not exciting, but ~name~’s definitely making it easy to sit back and enjoy this instead of working all the time.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,Almost out, ~name~. This has been fun!
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,Hmm. Not what I’d have picked but you’re not diverging from how you’re supposed to be playing…
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:7=happy,Okay, that was an interesting final choice, ~name~. But I’ve got my doubts you’ll be coming back after that.
2-female_removed_minor,targetStage:7=calm,Well, that was strange you saved something minor like your ~clothing~ for very last… But I have a hunch you aren’t disliking the attention now.
2-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
2-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.

3-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,What a pain.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh. I’d have figured you’d have gone for something a little more secure, ~name~. No need to rush. And I’m not saying that just because my uplink froze.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,A conservative first play, considering I’m already halfway naked...
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. What kind of tactical benefit does your ~clothing~ provide, ~name~?
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.

3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=calm,Okay, nothing bad, nothing good. <i>Pod</i>, report to Bunker that ~name~’s meeting expected trends.
3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=clever,Your ~clothing~ is interesting, ~name~. I mean, not as interesting as what you’ve got left to show, but interesting.

3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,~Clothing~... Maybe I should try something like that…
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=excited,I guess it probably doesn’t provide you much of a reason to keep it on past the first stage...
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=interested,Well, that’s that I guess.
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=happy,I have to admit, I was expecting you to deviate from this model a bit more…
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=clever,I guess that’s not terrible for a late game play, ~name~.
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, at least you’re almost out of items.
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,If you wouldn’t mind, can I see what makes that so important to you?
3-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=confident,It’s kind of odd you have everything hanging out and still have that for your very last piece, but… I guess that’s how some people like to play.

3-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
3-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=confident,I’m learning that based on your endorphin levels, I’m falling in the top 40% of what you find attractive.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,I’m guessing I’m the distraction here, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, that’s over with.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=confident,Okay. Well, we’ve already seen your breasts and genitals, so...
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,I mean, to beat her at this game.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,That’s kind of an odd first play. Don’t worry, ~name~, I’m sure you’ll catch up.
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,Not a bad play at all.
3-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=excited,Don’t count me out yet, ~name~. The longer this goes, the better my odds!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=clever,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
3-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.
3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.

4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:7=excited,Okay, you’re going to have to teach me this trick, ~name~.
4-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. That’s a good play, but not super satisfying.
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0=happy,<i>Pod</i>, check the composition of ~name~’s ~clothing~. I’m hoping there’s more to it than just…
4-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.

4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=happy,Neck and neck, ~name~.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,I’ll give it to you, ~name~, I’m usually pretty quick to adapt, but you’re putting up a great fight.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,<i>So</i> close.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,Good tactics, ~name~.
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,It makes no sense you kept that for last, but it seems to definitely be having an arousing effect...

4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,Not bad, ~name~. Have you ever considered helping the YorHa project?
4-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,Well, I can’t really complain since you’ve been kicking my butt so far.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.

4-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=excited,Are… Are those women’s clothes? Wait, is that something men can do? Can we wear dresses and tights? <i>Fascinating.</i>
4-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.

4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=happy,That’s a start. I hope I’ll enjoy the view as much as you have mine.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,Is that an old world ~clothing~?
4-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
4-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=happy,Well, you’re down by one more, ~name~.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=calm,You’re showing a lot of skin, ~name~, it’s a shame this isn’t much more.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=frustrated,I’m mostly just confused as to why you held onto that for so long…
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=clever,So, any particular reason you saved that for last, ~name~? I mean, you can basically see all of me, and I can see all of you, so...
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!

4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=frustrated,Yeah, yeah.
4-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=clever,This seems like a fine first piece. I wish I’d seen it a little sooner.
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,hough I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
4-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
4-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
4-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.

4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=calm,Well, anyway, I’m not hoping you’ll <i>lose</i> as much as my predictive algorithms will help me <i>win</i>.
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=interested,I’m excited to see what else
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.

4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=calm,<i>Pod</i>, go ahead and adjust her algorithm. I’m going to need to go on the offensive.

4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
4-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=clever,We can see so much of you, but it doesn’t seem like it’s over just yet.

5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=happy,I’m not exactly complaining but...
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:1=clever,For a first move, that seems fair.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=frustrated,I mean losing a game. Not the euphemism for “going down,” though I do die a lot when 2B’s around.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=interested,Hm. If we’re both exposed like this, maybe we should try that “going down” thing. I believe the tactile feedback would be even better than the optical.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=interested,Well, I’m happy that I’m not the only man like this, but that it’s ~name~ makes this even better.
5-male_removed_minor,targetStage:8=happy,Well, that’s that, ~name~. I have to say, I like the visuals on this look!
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=interested,hough I must admit, they’re kind of like 2B’s and they do draw the eye…
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=happy,--Oh, those are <i>very</i> nice legs, if you’d like, I can rub--
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,our earrings and yo-yo seem to project energy around you, forming the costume. And the costume does something to increase sensory and physical output while reducing damage you suffer.
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=calm,Hm. I’ve only known 2B to wear armor once. Most of the time evasion works best for androids like us.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=clever,Don’t get overconfident. One or two bad hands and <i>woosh</i>, you’re naked like me, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:4-6=interested,Looks like the cards are “drawing down” on you, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=calm,Saki reminds me of Pascal, from the Forest Village.
5-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=happy,You keep losing, Shimakaze. Maybe it’s time to change your chip loadout?
5-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=calm,<i>Pod,</i> run a scan of Futaba’s beta waveform again. This seems weird…
5-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, what's this meter...? "Forthrightness...?" Let's crank that up...
5-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=calm,I really think I prefer something much more casual than bulky armor.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=frustrated,I’m not super worried about being hit, but I have a feeling the others aren’t so protected.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=excited,Actually, wait a second! That chip looks kind of like my hacking interface! Are you trying to show off your talents to me, Chiaki? I can't say I mind the attention!
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,It seems suboptimal to play like that, but humans aren't exactly known for being consistent...
5-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=clever,If you don’t model data, what would you even do if you’re not in an android series…
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Pod, run R070…
5-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=excited,You’re just biologically attuned?
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=interested,Oh. Okay, garble your words. I see.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,What are you saying, exactly?
5-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=frustrated,The tactical feed from my pod should make the next round interesting... H-huh? I'm not cheating. I'm just using tactical networking...
5-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=interested,I’m not detecting a black box…
5-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=happy,I like your spirit of competition but… You seem a little overconfident.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=interested,You’ve put up a good match, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:7=calm,<i>Pod</i>, make sure to scan this supplemental data. Based on ~name~’s figure, I think many of the female androids might like to get a good look at her.
5-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=clever,It may require refinement, but I bet you could be hacking and strafing in no time. Er. Digitally too!
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=interested,Why don’t I scout ahead and see what you have next, ~name~?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:1-3=excited,Oh, your ~clothing~? Not your… Uh, other stuff?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=frustrated,I’m losing this badly?
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0=frustrated,I’m… Not used to being so bad at games like this.
5-female_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.
5-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=clever,It’s a clever way to disperse your device’s energy output while still providing combat support. I’d love to gather data from whoever made your “Miraculous.”
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Aimee, we all have our archaic interests, but would you mind being just a <i>bit</i> more cautious?
5-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=clever,Well, if ~player~ didn't know you were interested, I think that display of your underwear erases any doubts.
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,I guess let’s keep playing.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=rage,I can’t even really enjoy this, if I’m being honest!
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1=rage,I can’t believe I’m this far behind!
5-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm,alsoPlaying:marinette=frustrated,A lucky charm? Do you and Marinette have something you need to tell the rest of us about?
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=frustrated,Based on how your nerves are connected, you still have full function. Sure, it's not pretty or whatever, but it's only skin deep. Your mind is far more important, Kyoko.
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=clever,The only thing 2B hacks are machines. And she just hacks them to bits. With a sword, usually. Anyway, I’m the Scanner in our partnership.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
5-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=clever,No, no, you’re fine. Your mental map is a bit different from the ones I’m used to, is all.
5-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=calm,Hm… Fascinating, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,Who needs armor when you’re made of the finest dermal plating and synthetic sinew mankind’s ever known? It’s far easier to dodge, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=frustrated,Are we just blind to each other? Am I an illusion? Do I dream of electric sheep?
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:1,filter:superhero=calm,Hm. I guess sufficiently advanced technology might resemble magic...
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.
5-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=calm,I do get the feeling that you're already kind of used to doing that in physical space.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=calm,You know, Corrin, I’d try those gloves on now if you would… Actually, that would be cheating. Not that I’d need to cheat when I've got my tactical network up and running now.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,It’s not that what you’re taking off is boring, it’s just… A little behind where my model told me to expect.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:2-4=clever,Well, no tactical plan survives encounter with the enemy. Not that you and I couldn’t be friends, ~name~.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
5-female_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=excited,Let’s see what your next play is, since you’re really… Exposed.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:5-7=happy,This was fun, ~name~. We aren’t much separated now.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:innuendo=calm,Hm.
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=excited,I’d be happy to do a more in-depth study, if this is how you… Act and play. And look.
5-female_removed_minor,targetStage:8=clever,Would you want to try again sometimes?
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=clever,I see, you aren't an android, then. <i>Pod,</i> run a trace elements scan on her armor. I can't make heads or tails of it.
5-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=frustrated,I can’t believe YorHa has lost so much human history… To think of what we could’ve accomplished if White Chlorination Syndrome hadn’t taken hold.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,Well, I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. In like, an epilogue or something like that.
5-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=calm,Hm. I wonder if those old Red Ribbon Army protocols created any interesting combat models.

-3-male_removing_minor=frustrated,Hm. Not quite small enough to complain about, not quite big enough to be really satisfying.
-3-male_removing_minor=happy,Well, your ~clothing~ is fine too. I mean, you’re doing fine, and are fine, so the clothing is fine.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=calm,Okay, at least you don’t seem to be crying.
-3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:superhero=frustrated,What makes you bigger than a regular hero?
-3-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=frustrated,The Tarakkians do certainly seem monstrous. They must be like Machine Lifeforms.
-3-male_removing_minor,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=clever,I’m one of the only combat-capable YorHa scanner models, but I have to say that’s not nearly as impressive as some of our Pod programs or close range gear.

-3-male_removed_minor=confident,I hope that, without my visor, I’m not super reptitive.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=frustrated,Huh. Come to think of it, most androids do look really similar. But what exactly are the two of you? Machines? Humans? Not with those ears, I'd bet.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=clever,It’s uh, interesting to try and model how innocence can cause tragedy, I think.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=clever,Hmm... but wouldn't you perform better with a combat visor? It's hard to believe you're so potent in combat!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=clever,...This is technically pretty interesting. I’m pretty impressed you’re doing all the physics calculations to not die so quickly.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:cheater9s,totalMales:4=interested,Oh. You know, that does sound a lot like cheating when you put it that way, Mahiru.

#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=happy,Huh. I guess this’ll have to do for now.
male_removed_major=interested,No no, your stripping is great! I mean my algorithm.

0-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,You’re out of your league, ~name~. Not to get overconfident, but I hope you’re holding out on us.
0-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Your ~clothing~ isn’t doing you any good, ~name~, maybe losing it’ll help you focus.
0-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=excited,Current tactics are clearly working, judging by the size of that piece. I’m not going easy on you, ~name~!
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,9S to Operator. 9S: No casualties. ~name~: 8. Consider this report sufficient countermeasures.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=calm,I’ll admit that I don’t get your strategy, ~name~, but I don’t want to waste a lot of time studying one that’s so clearly… bad.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=confident,At this point, I shouldn’t really be surprised. I’d just expected more a fight to get here.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,I was hoping to improve my behavioral algorithms, but between my Pod and myself, it doesn’t look like I really need much fine tuning for human men, ~name~.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,You’re keeping it interesting. I’d have guessed you’d start smaller.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=excited,This is going to be fun, ~name~!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=clever,That’s a substantial loss for an early game play.
0-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=frustrated,You’re going to have to play better, ~name~. Keep going like this and it’ll be over for you and I won’t have even started yet...
0-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
0-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
0-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
0-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, 'Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought.'”
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like.'"
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “Off comes my dress.  'I <i>do</i> wear underwear. Now I'm going to get <i>serious</i>.'”
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought.”
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “'Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now.'”
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Well, it’s a big piece, but you kind of put it in a bad spot, because everyone can see… Well, almost everything.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=rage,Your choices in this game don’t make sense. Are you some sort of deliberately bugged simulation, ~name~? Maybe a logic virus spiked into my visor or something?
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=confident,You’re really running out of options, ~name~.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=clever,9S to Bunker. Status report: ~name~ continues to lose, while I suffer no losses. Syncing encounter data now.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hmm. It seems a little early to take off your ~clothing~, ~name~.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,That’s a big hit for so early in the game.
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=clever,Wait, you’re starting with your ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Huh! I didn’t expect you to lose your ~clothing~ first.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
0-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
0-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=frustrated,I think you used your ~clothing~ wrong. Why didn’t you cover your other assets, unless this was some sort of deception? Human women are so strange.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=excited,There. That’s all eight of your pieces, without anything down on me. I’d be almost flattered if the goal wasn’t to gather data on game theory.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=confident,I’m not surprised that you had to take off something big, but I am surprised you’re over halfway done and I haven’t even taken off my gloves.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,I wonder if 21O would play like ~name~... Hmm...
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,With your load lightened, maybe you can perform better.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=clever,I can respect taking smart risks early, but I hope they pay off, ~name~. Your ~clothing~ seemed hard to refabricate.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=frustrated,Is this supposed to be a grand gesture? A bad play? Something to incite confusion…? Well, it’s working.
0-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=interested,I can’t wait to see what other plays you’re going to make, ~name~. That’s quite the start!
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
0-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.


#lost gloves
1-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,Are you taunting me, ~name~? These models are really important, and beneficial for the glory of mankind.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Oh, so you’re not very smart. That’s… Disappointing.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,All according to plan. Note that plan means a compiled series of data based on your hormone levels, stance display, and corroborated using existing background statistics and my own high levels of training as a YorHa scanner unit.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,Hm. Well, your ~clothing~ matches trend data.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Not an unusual play, but if you’re dropping a big piece like that early...
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=happy,I think I’ll enjoy this. Great data and an interesting physical display.
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Oh? Starting strong, ~name~?
1-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,Hey, ~name~, just because it’s your first lost doesn’t mean you <i>have</i> to make a big show of confidence.

1-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,Well, this was a pleasant diversion.
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,Now that we’re caught up, keep on playing how you’re playing, ~name~. Don’t go easy on me, because I’m not going to go easy on you.

1-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,Are you going to be taking this more seriously, now, ~name~?
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,Hm. Cortisol and testosterone are rising. Are you going to give up a better fight now, ~name~?
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=excited,Not bad, ~name~. Not good, given how poorly you’re doing. But it’s not bad!
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,Well, we’re reaching the end, ~name~. Any more tricks up your sleeve? Does that euphemism even apply now?
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,Well, you look good, at least, even if you’re playing like an idiot.
1-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=rage,If you deliberately try and provoke me into making weird responses, you’ll be making things a lot harder for Scanner units down the line!
1-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
1-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.

1-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Hm. My encounter data for human females in your age range and phenotypic skillset suggested you’d start with something a little smaller… Way to keep it interesting, ~name~.

1-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=clever,That’s a good choice accordingly to the algorithm. And, you know, enjoyment.

1-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Once you’re finished, could you tell me why you didn’t just… Wear that?

2-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,<i>Pod</i>, compare ~name~’s ~clothing~ to his behavioral algorithm…
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,That’s pretty interesting, ~name~!
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,For his first play, ~name~’s taking off ~clothing~!
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you really taking your ~clothing~ off first? Did my two losses really make me seem that pathetic?
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,This is a big loss for you, ~name~. I don’t want to be a bully, so I’ll let you in on a secret...
2-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=frustrated,I’m not going to throw a hand just because you’re losing.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=interested,That’s a bold start, ~name~. Let’s see what comes after your ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=excited,Well… I liked that ~clothing~, ~name~. It was a good defense to forfeit.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=happy,It’s a bit early for something like that, but I’m not complaining.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,Huh. That’s a good variant choice. Usually human males don’t opt to to that at this stage in the game.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,I will let you know my next item is fairly important.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,I’m not going to upload <i>this</i> to my records.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Why did you save that?
2-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=excited,All over but the actual losing, ~name~. I look forward to seeing how you finalize your encounter data.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
2-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, 'Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought.'”
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like.'"
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “Off comes my dress.  'I <i>do</i> wear underwear. Now I'm going to get <i>serious</i>.'”
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought.”
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “'Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now.'”
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,I’d critique going so hard from the get-go, but you are pretty ahead of me, ~name~...
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Wow, ~name~’s definitely feeling brave. I
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Hm. I guess something big has to come off without showing your weakpoints at some stage… I guess you wanted this one, huh?
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=excited,That’s a bold statement.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Yeah, yeah. You lost the hand, something big is coming off, and so on.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,There we go. I wish I were just a bit more ahead, but your ~clothing~ seems like a good choice.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,<i>Sigh</i>.
2-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,~name~... You’re about to lose but…
2-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
2-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=frustrated,I haven’t seen someone goad other players since A2…
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,When you’re doing well, I guess it’s easy to get caught up in the moment.
2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,I really shouldn’t have to tell you saving your ~clothing~ for after the important parts are exposed isn’t the way this is supposed to work.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=happy,You look great like this, ~name~. It’s actually really cool to see what someone looks like without having to be modified into looking like that.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,<i>Pod</i>, make sure you record my vitals. I’m feeling a lot of things watching ~name~.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=excited,Good data, and good visual variety here tonight! Most of the androids I know are just restricted to very similar appearances, though their personalities differ a lot!
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,I wouldn’t overdo it, even if you’re doing well against me, ~name~. Don’t ask for your ~clothing~ back if I start winning.
2-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,That’s interesting apparel, but what’s more interesting is how you look now, ~name~.

3-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Everyone’s running out of armor
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=clever,I see you’re deploying major countermeasures.
3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=frustrated,He saved his ~clothing~ for last? Why? Everything else is already on display?
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=interested,Are you hiding something more defenseless than your anatomy, ~name~? Something embarrassing?
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=excited,I like the forwardness!
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,Just because you’re ahead and making big plays like that just means this is going to be more fun.
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,<i>Pod</i>, note that this playstyle is having a high success rate in both arousing this Scanner unit and winning the game.
3-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=happy,Don’t worry ~name~, you’ll be all caught up in no time.
3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.

3-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,I still can’t make sense of the play. I keep reviewing the materials… Are you just trying to troll?
3-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Well, whatever reason you kept that on, you’re almost done.

3-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=clever,It’s a good idea to save your big stuff for last...

4-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,There we go. Looks like my model is <i>finally</i> working.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=happy,Speaking of models, have you considered serving as a body template, ~name~? I think the YorHa morale would improve if more male androids looked like you.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=interested,Though I have to admit model No.~name~ seems a bit… Indulgent.
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Though, seeing your anatomy is… A mitigating element.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=happy,Well, at least we get to see <i>all</i> of you now. No need to be shy, ~name~. It’s just a body!
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=happy,Well, hopefully the rest is just as good. I mean, of you.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=interested,Okay, that’s that, right?
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=clever,I didn’t even have to hack to get here. Not a bad use of time.
4-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=calm,You know, This is <i>way</i> better when you’re not just looking at it through a screen.
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=rage,Everyone be careful!
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,But why the armor if you’re planning on dodging…? Are you distracting your foes with your legs…?
4-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=interested,Shimakaze, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
4-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=clever,What I mean to say is that I’m trying to explain phenomena like why you’d keep your glasses and headphones on, but part with other gear.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=confident,Okay, that’s an odd last choice.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=rage,Oh come on, I’m almost out of the game, why are you showing off everything else but keeping a grip on that?
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,~name~, I’m interested to see what you look like without your ~clothing~...
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=happy,This’ll be good.
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, 'Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought.'”
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “So I'm out of my dress, you could already tell what I looked like.'"
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “Off comes my dress.  'I <i>do</i> wear underwear. Now I'm going to get <i>serious</i>.'”
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “Off comes my dress. You're proving to be better than I thought.”
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=clever,You really do remind me of 2B! She’d probably be like “Ah, emotions are prohibited. This game is stupid, “'Maybe I'll start taking this seriously now.'”
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=rage,You know, I’m all out of major items, so it makes me a little jealous to see that you still have some.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,I’m not jealous that ~name~’s just now taking off something big.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,Hey, I don’t mind playing with a handicap. It’s ~name~’s choice if she wants to be suboptimal.
4-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=clever,Oh, I see, you’re trying to be distracting, aren’t you?
4-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=interested,You’re going to take off your pants before your shirt? Why?
4-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,I want to see if this uncanny luck of yours is just smart playing or something else…
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=confident,A two-for-one! Maybe not the best play given how everything’s going.
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=frustrated,I... would hope that you wouldn't use a hydrocarbon fuel as a lubricant... I wonder how the female androids at YorHa are designed for intercourse...
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=confident,You might regret being so hasty, ~name~. I’m just about to step it up.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=calm,Well, I’m happy I at least get to see ~name~ lose once.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=happy,Huh. This is pretty miraculous technology, I guess.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=interested,Like a soul? That’s… A little too heavy for this game, I think.
4-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=interested,Was this some sort of projection or camouflage? Weird… Though it would explain the weird readings I was getting earlier from your suit.
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:necklacestrip=interested,Huh. That stone of yours seems to resonate with a strange energy signature. How curious…
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=frustrated,Er. Or something like that.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=clever,Aren’t ignition type rounds sort of outdated? Surely your organization would rather you go into battle properly armed.
4-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. Right. Sorry, Shimakaze. I keep forgetting you're like me. Your designers should be very proud!
4-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player6=excited,...Or just nothing. This was fun, ~player~!
4-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,Ah, so you're shutting down while you incorporate your upgrade... right? I will say I enjoy the new aesthetics without your dress! Far more streamlined.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=confident,Fine, you’re vulnerable, I’m not, let’s keep going.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,What a pain you are. In terms of analysis, I uh, mean.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh wow, you have such wonderful… Assets. Do you ever back those up?
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,<i>Pod</i>, backup my data to bunker. ~name~ is making my black box sizzle.
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,Well, don’t count yourself or me out just yet. We still have a lot of hands left to play in this simulation!
4-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=confident,I’m not too far ahead of you, ~name~. Though… Maybe you’d like for me to get behind you?
4-female_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.


#lost boxers
5-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. <i>Pod</i>, run a quick diagnostic...
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:0=confident,Oh wow, you’re playing really well, except for the “removing a major article first,” ~name~.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,Wow, ~name~, you’re easy on the eyes.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,Hmm. The combat visor has no negative filtering set… So I can see you just as well with it on as I would without it.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=happy,Phew. Close match, ~name~.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,I’m just glad to be finally done.
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,Your Old World-style ~clothing~?
5-male_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=calm,Your ~clothing~? I was wondering when you’d be removing that countermeasure…
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
5-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=frustrated,Those underwear look like something YorHa would make! But you seem so embarrassed. Why? <i>Pod</i>, why is he being aroused by being humiliated? That doesn’t make any sense.

5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=happy,This is it! Nothing left but the good stuff!
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player5,notSaidMarker:player6,marker:player6=clever,Wow, you're really using all the tricks in the book, huh, ~player~?
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=calm,I’m running out of interesting commentary. Suffice to say, I’m surprised you saved a major article for last.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:8=interested,Scanning and commenting on all this tactical data isn’t easy… So I hope you know that despite that, it was worth it, ~player~.
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=happy,Hm. Your second piece non-exposing piece, huh?
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player1,notSaidMarker:player2,marker:player2=clever,You’re not an AI, but I feel like you have some tricks up your sleeve the rest of us don’t.
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
5-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=clever,~player~, that was an interesting choice. But let’s see if we can’t get some more interesting data out of you yet!
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,Oh wow, ~name~’s taking off his ~clothing~? While I’m exposed like this?
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, I assume you’re easy on the eyes even without my visor, anyway. Maybe easier, given the lack of constant data influx.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,Say, does your ~clothing~ happen to come in my size? I bet it’d look good in black. And reinforced for combat.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=happy,I have to say, I’m liking the variety of ~name~’s ~clothing~ over the kind of… Monochromatic thing we have going on at YorHa.
5-male_removed_major,target:human,notSaidMarker:player1,marker:player1=happy,You in particular seem like you’re worth analysis, ~player~.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,Well, Pod hasn’t led me wrong yet, so I guess you aren’t cheating, ~name~.
5-male_removed_major,targetStage:1=frustrated,You started with something big. It’s a big start. But it’s just a start...
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=clever,Wait, there’s more Miraculous...es? Miraculii? How do you say that?
5-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=rage,Uh- <i>Pod</i>?
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=frustrated,What is this? Nayru, is this some sort of augmentation?

5-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=calm,Hm. You’ve held onto that for a while, ~name~.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:7=interested,So, you’re saving your big ~clothing~ for last?
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=calm,A typical play. But, still enjoyable.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:4-6=interested,~name~, I’m really glad you’re here. Your aesthetics are truly memorable. I’m glad you’re one of the first real humans I’ve gotten to meet.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=clever,It’s a start, but not a terribly strong one.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:1-3=interested,Did you consider bringing more big stuff, or is it just a hassle to keep that on before taking off smaller things?
5-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=interested,Well, thanks, ~name~. I appreciate the concession.
5-female_removing_major,targetStage:0=happy,Aw, ~name~, you shouldn’t have.

5-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=calm,I can understand if it was smaller, but isn’t it defeating the purpose of the game if we can already see the rest of you?
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:8=clever,There. Almost done.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=interested,My visor is saying… Wow, you’re enjoying this, based on… Certain forms of viscous excretion.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:5-7=happy,It helps that you’re pretty and confident. Or um. I think you are.

5-female_removed_major,targetStage:1=clever,But I’m not out just yet. Keep it going!
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=calm,I’m just curious. I don’t… Really wear other outfits.
5-female_removed_major,targetStage:2-4=excited,I think a lot of the people who participate in these simulation exercises don’t tend to consider other types of costumes.

-3-male_removing_major=interested,~name~’s taking off something big. His ~clothing~, it looks like.
-3-male_removing_major=happy,That’s certainly interesting, ~name~.
-3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=interested,Okay…

-3-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!

-1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player2,notSaidMarker:player3,marker:player3=happy,You’ve been keeping this up pretty well!
-1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=excited,Oh. I have to say, I’ve always enjoyed the default anatomy of some of the combat YorHa models… Your legs are very enticing. I guess all that running around does make you kind of built like 2B!
-1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=clever,I’m happy to see you taking a turn to lose, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player3,notSaidMarker:player4,marker:player4=happy,Really getting down to it, huh, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=excited,Whoa, you must’ve worked really hard for that physique! I can tell you’re very combat experienced!
-1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=excited,Always a pleasure to watch you, ~player~! I'm honored you picked me.
-1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:player4,notSaidMarker:player5,marker:player5=interested,Well, if that wasn’t the last piece...
-1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=clever,I’m not staring. I’m not thinking of how 2B would look in this outfit.
-1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,It’s… A work in progress with you, I’m afraid. Maybe you <i>are</i> just playing the game by a different set of rules.




#OPPONENT REVEALING CHEST OR CROTCH
#Characters have different sizes, allowing your character have different responses for each. Males have a small, medium, or large crotch. Females have small, medium, or large breasts.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Hmm. You're going to show us your chest, right, ~name~?
male_chest_is_visible=confident,Not bad!
male_crotch_will_be_visible=frustrated,Damn. I'm going to see your penis but my context scanning isn't working... Peculiar...
male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm,Huh. I guess that's small, but is it because we're playing with so many large people?
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy,I think mine matches yours, ~name~.
male_large_crotch_is_visible=frustrated,I didn't know that type of anatomy could come in such a large size. That seems rather inconvenient...
female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,I guess it's time to see those tits of yours, ~name~!
female_small_chest_is_visible=clever,Hm. Those aren't even picking up on my Scanner...
female_large_chest_is_visible=excited,For some reason I get a real mothering instinct from you, ~name~.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy,Looks like you're just about done, ~name~. Not that this line should trigger normally.
female_crotch_is_visible=confident,Huh. I can see the appeal.

0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
0-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hmm… I wonder which one I’d want…
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly *equipped* in other ways.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.

1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly *equipped* in other ways.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.


#lost boots
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.

2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.

3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly *equipped* in other ways.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?


#lost shorts
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
4-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.

4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?


#lost boxers
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
5-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
5-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
5-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly *equipped* in other ways.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mulan,totalNaked:1=interested,Any question, huh? Scan shows some atemporal energy on you. These “worlds” you talk about, how do you get between them?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit=excited,You’re in good shape, Pit! I was at least made like this, so I can’t imagine having to work hard for a formidable state like yours.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Running out of countermeasures, ~name~?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=frustrated,I don’t really understand your reasoning behind saving your chest for last...
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=clever,I’m glad you seem to be human...ish.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=confident,Hm. I thought we were supposed to delay that sort of exposure for a while...
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,A big loss for ~name~.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,alsoPlaying:palutena=interested,Oh, I get it! Your relationship with Palutena is like mine with 2B. I see, I see. Don’t worry, I understand you, Pit!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=rage,I’d hate for androids to get a reputation for being weak.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,But a big win for the rest of us.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=confident,It’s impressive. Though… Aren’t the nipples supposed to be more a female thing?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Especially when you uncovered your penis so early.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit=happy,That seemed comfortable, but like my coat, I suppose it’s ultimately designed to come off.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Well, you kept most of yourself covered for most of the game. That’s admirable competition, I suppose.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=clever,Good playing so far, ~name~. But this is a big weak point coming up, right?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=happy,Huh, I won’t complain, but it’s a bit early to expose yourself, don’t you think?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,You put up a great game, ~name~.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=happy,Well, this was a fun exchange, Pit.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Wow, your cortisol is really shooting up. And I think something else is too...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,You’re already showing off your most valuable physical asset? Why?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=excited,Oh, well that’s an interesting modality. I’ve heard that larger ones used to be preferred among human woman. Though I'm certainly not one of those.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=excited,Oh, don’t be shy, ~name~. Your anatomy lends itself really well to lots of sexual acts that would be uncomfortable with bigger tools. That <i>has</i> to be valuable.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=interested,Hm. So your strategy is to get it out now, ~name~, and hope it distracts us? Interesting...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,I like ~name~’s build. With your size like that, you must be really mobile, and less vulnerable to targeted attacks.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, I see. You must not have a lot of usage with your tool. Don’t worry, ~name~, this’ll be a great chance to generate new data.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=interested,Oh! We match! Should we compare more closely?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,It’s kind of a bad play to just take your penis out so early, ~name~... Unless that’s exactly why you’re doing it?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8,filter:circumcised=interested,Whoa, no wonder you saved that for last, it certainly looks different from mine.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=happy,Whew. My model had said you’d be up soon, but I wasn’t so sure… Worth the wait though!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=frustrated,Wait, you were serious? Why would you mess around like that? This data is going to be junk!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1-4,filter:uncircumcised=interested,Oh, well, I disagree with you playing so early, but it’s a good sample in terms of… Well, mine isn’t that different.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=interested,Hm. That seems roughly equivalent to mine… Different texture though. Do you mind if I gather some data on our differences, ~name~?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:0-7,filter:circumcised=interested,Huh, ~name~, could I get a closer look? Your anatomy seems formatted differently from mine.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-8,filter:uncircumcised=clever,Huh, all that buildup, just for the same loadout I’m using?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=excited,Honor is kind of a bad concept. If you have big guns like that, why wouldn’t you shoot them first? Or, uh, show them, for our purposes.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,You’re really excited to show that off, if you’ve taken it out so soon! Good for you, ~name~.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,I’m not sure <i>how</i> you were hiding that, but I think YorHa would be interested in knowing.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Whoa. I didn’t know you could tune a penis to that size. I get why you’d want an impressive thing like that on display.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=excited,Whoa, already, ~name~? You should’ve come better equipped.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=interested,Hm. Most women usually opt to show off their breasts first… Are you really that embarrassed, ~name~?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=happy,Hm. I think seeing ~name~’s chest will provide a great point of comparison. I hope that’s not too forward.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=calm,I see. I wonder if they’re still on Earth, about 9000 years after your era. It would be an interesting YorHa project to seek them out.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=confident,Oh, because you don’t need the support?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,<i>Pod</i>, run a combat analysis. I think Cammy's a pretty good fighter, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=frustrated,Oh, that's no good. Have you ever tried reinforcing the carapace around your black box? Accidental internal detonations would be pretty bad...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=interested,Right, Twilight Sparkle.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Hm. So... are you just fiddling with it to buy time?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Don’t worry. You’re among… Ah, reasonable company!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly *equipped* in other ways.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Wait, are you seriously starting with that? That’s so counterintuitive. <i>Pod</i>, don’t add this to the data model, please.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=frustrated,I shouldn’t have to tell you that sufficiently advanced image technology…
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=frustrated,Some of these shots don’t make sense.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Oh, I see.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=happy,Last surprise? Oh. Right. I <i>kind of figured,</i> but let’s wait to see if the others figure it out.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,The comparison part was apt, anyway.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,~name~ has a minimalist design, it seems. Usually S-type models are built like that. I mean, even the female S-types aren’t much more endowed than me.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, I see. They’re not particularly large, so there’s no need to cover them. How confident, ~name~.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=interested,Well huh! I guess your default model comes with nipples. Are they sensitive too, or just cosmetic?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Hm. Those seem to be fairly typical.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confident,I think I read somewhere that courage is acting brave even when your instincts tell you to run. So I guess you’re pretty brave.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Not too forward at all. I don’t suppose you would mind a Scanner type getting… Ah, close-range data?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Oh. Aren’t you just so pink!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=happy,Well, I see you’re certainly *equipped* in other ways.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=clever,They’re fine to look at, though.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=frustrated,Hm. There’s no deformations or cultural oddities like deficient or excessive size… Why save these for last, ~name~?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy=confident,Well, I was worried that only <i>battle</i>-models got aroused by fighting. This is working on me too! I learned something today!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=clever,That’s a pretty name, but it seems like something you picked yourself. Then again, I like to go by Nines…
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=excited,Wow! Those are really impressive!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=confident,If you optimize your targeting protocol like… You know what, I’m not going to tell you. You figure it out, crazy.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=happy,Well, I suppose so!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=clever,How do you fight with a pair like that? That’s a lot of weight to carry around.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, I can see it being… Uncomfortable to keep those under wraps for too long.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=interested,Wow, even the Commander isn’t quite as… Embellished. I think.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,targetStage:8=clever,I see, that does make a nice finish...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:0=frustrated,Hey, whoa whoa whoa, why are you showing that off first?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=excited,I've seen lots of anatomical guidebooks on humans... and some androids like to get anatomy installed...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=interested,Er, your Oma and Fama. You aren’t the only one here without a father and mother, I guess.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=clever,Whoa, I was expecting <i>some</i> texture there.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=interested,You just look <i>so</i> much like another member of YorHa! But I know you aren’t! It makes me feel… Well, interested and confused.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=interested,Like I was saying, you didn’t wear…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=interested,I suppose this adds a lot of variety. Her getting... uh... "help."
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,Though… I guess the B-series of androids do end up getting pleasure from combat…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=happy,That means it’s a good model, and you’re providing excellent assurance. Thank you for your contributions against the Machines, Twilight.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=excited,You really are doing exactly the opposite of what the model predicts!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:7=confident,You put up a good play, ~name~, but this is it for you!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=frustrated,I was worried you were suffering from a virus, given you’re starting with your highest valued item...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:1-3=frustrated,Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to protect your lower anatomy the most? It has all of your reproductive material!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,targetStage:4-6=interested,Huh, you held out for quite a while, at least. I am a bit curious to see one that’s purely natural...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:2-4=rage,YorHa works so hard to protect humanity’s legacy, ~name~. While you’re enticing, it’s… Somewhat hard for me to put aside my duty.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:1=calm,I’m… Confused by this choice, but I suppose you weren’t trying to start off with that many layers, or something. Is this just a bug?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:8=confident,Well, for your countermeasures anyway. You don’t have to self-destruct until next round.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,targetStage:5-7=clever,You look very nice, ~name~. You’re certainly giving me a rush of good hormones.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:kyussy=frustrated,Let’s not call it that.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=happy,Maybe Aimee’s biometrics were used somewhere along the line in the YorHa Project…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=excited,You’re really downplaying your own appearance, Meia.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=clever,Oh, I get it. So they'll come back next round too, right? I think with the game setup the way it is...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=confident,But I've never actually seen it in person, let alone used! I'm really interested in how you're built, Shimakaze. Have you... you know, tested your components yet?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=clever,Oh, I think I see why female anatomy is sometimes called a box. It’s like a blackbox, with all the fuzzy matter on the outside. I get it now!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=excited,Hm. Futaba, you were right, this was a pretty uh… Enticing play.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=happy,Hm. Normally, I’d be pretty frustrated, but let’s see if my model runs in reverse.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=happy,Oh. Okay. Way less confused and <i>way</i> more engaged now. Um. Too much information?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=happy,I haven’t seen many female androids with the extra anatomy installed, but most look like that. It’s nice to see that the YorHa developers went for a timeless look.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=interested,That’s really interesting! Humans are so creative with even the smallest bits of their anatomy. Very attractive, ~name~!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,Well, this is different, maybe-imaginary-fairy-girl.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

female_start_masturbating=interested,I honestly haven’t seen another person do this in… Uh, person.
female_masturbating=calm,~name~’s enjoying herself. That’s nice, even though she lost so fast.
female_masturbating=interested,Wow, that looks like it elicited a great response. Can you do that again so Pod can track it?

female_finished_masturbating=clever,Wow, that was quite the climax. Uh, and the orgasm too.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
-3-must_masturbate_first=rage,I can’t believe I lost… And so badly…
-3-must_masturbate=confident,I haven’t done this before, but… I’m a fast learner.
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=interested,Hm? I suppose the same way you'd know where your genitals are, Elizabeth. Aren't you terribly familiar with them?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:jura=frustrated,<i>Sigh.</i> This requires a second to build up. But I'm not a fake man, I'm just a male android, Jura. I'm not trying to be something I'm not...
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=interested,Er, Elizabeth, is autoproximation a YorHa improvement? I see you needed help finding... Your own genitals?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:pit=interested,Admittedly, this will be a first for me, Pit. Any tips?
-3-must_masturbate,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=frustrated,I can't believe I lost! And, well, this is more of a beta-test, Palutena. It's not like... anyway, I guess you'll see!
-3-start_masturbating=starting,Here I go…
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jura=starting,Think? Uh, I guess right now that I'm being studied and want to perform well, Jura.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit=starting,Well, I think I can figure it out. And if not, I can always ask Pod-153 to stream me some useful-- Ah damn it, no visor!

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:pit,timeInStage:1=excited,It's <i>extremely</i> enjoyable, in fact, Pit.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:9s_duel,notSaidMarker:duel_lost,marker:duel_lost=calm,Well, this game is a simulation based on an old world erotic game called “The Inventory,” right? I suppose, Mulan, it's easier to fight for humanity when you understand them more.

-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:rinkah,priority:0,marker:D-Series.=frustrated,I don't think it's a design flaw to minimize non-essential fluids, Rinkah. Take it up with the D-Series.

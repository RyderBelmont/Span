#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
swap_cards=devoted,Lady Palutena, please bless these next ~cards~.
swap_cards=thinking,Um... can I trade for ~cards~?
swap_cards=shy,Not feeling these ~cards~. I'd like something else, please.
swap_cards=annoyed,Yeah, these ~cards~ can go.




#HAND QUALITY
#These lines appear each round when a character is commenting on how good or bad their hand is.
#The lines written here are examples only and should be replaced.

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,(I could have brought weapons? Whoops.)
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,Just Pit. Like bottomless pits?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,I'm not an android. It's just Pit.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,Just call me Pit. Should be easy enough to remember.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:kyu=stripping,I-I hope by "pegging" you mean pirate stuff.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,(Come to think of it, I've never met Ares. Wonder what he's like?)
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,Motif? This is just my uniform...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,Why would I need to dress up like the gods, Ladybug? I <i>serve</i> them. Er, one.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripping,Uh...thanks? Was that a compliment?
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripping,Oh, is that all? I guess that's fine.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:saki=stripping,Hmm... to be honest, even I don't know.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:saki=stripping,Only Palutena knows, to be honest. I don't remember much of my early life.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:saki=stripping,I <i>think</i> I've always been an angel, but...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,I'm getting mixed messages here...


#losing sandals
2-stripped=stripped,Its sacrifice will not be in vain!
2-stripped=stripped,Wait... did weapons count? Shoot, I could've brought my bow! Too late now...
2-stripped=stripped,Everything's fine. Just act like nothing even happened.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=beat,I really hope you didn't jinx it.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=joking,N-No, I didn't come unarmed...I'm just... using a Palm, is all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:juri=awkward,(I know I could take her in a fight... but let's not provoke her.)
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=shy,But, uh... why are you getting all flustered, Natsuki?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,W-Where's this going, Kyu?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Uh, okay... I'd like that back, though.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=awkward,Do I really? Stop, you'll make me blush.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=awkward,Thanks! You're pretty fascinating yourself!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=angry,I take back my thanks! I-I won't let you corrupt me!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998,count-marinette:1=stunned,Hades was super scary! If you're interested, I can share my heroic tales fighting him after this game.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:996,count-marinette:1=joking,I can assure you Ladybug, she is <i>not</i> flirting with me. Just some friendly banter is all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998=stripped,I'm in for the long haul, aren't I?
2-must_strip_winning=joking,Ah, well, I was starting to feel a bit bad for you all.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:marinette=surprised,Ugh. I can hardly stand socks when I'm <i>barefoot</i>. I don't want to imagine wearing them with sandals!
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:morrigan=embarrassed,U-Usually I like fun, but I'm not sure my fun and your fun are the same thing!
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,W-What is it? C'mon, tell me!
2-must_strip_normal=loss,Aw... I lost again?
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:morrigan=embarrassed,U-Usually I like fun, but I'm not sure my fun and your fun are the same thing!
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:marinette=surprised,Ugh. I can hardly stand socks when I'm <i>barefoot</i>. I don't want to imagine wearing them with sandals!
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,W-What is it? C'mon, tell me!
2-must_strip_losing=angry,What is this, Everybody Pick on Pit Day?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:marinette=surprised,Ugh. I can hardly stand socks when I'm <i>barefoot</i>. I don't want to imagine wearing them with sandals!

2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,W-What is it? C'mon, tell me!
2-stripping=stripping,All I can really afford to lose are my sandals, so I'm going with that.
2-stripping=stripping,Sorry they're kind of worn down. They melted years ago, but Lady Palutena insisted I wear them instead of my newer pair.
2-stripping=stripping,I'm not a fan of socks, but I wish I had <i>anything</i> else to protect me if I lose again.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripping,Are you okay? You keep looking back and forth between me and ~player~, Natsuki.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998=stripping,What are you talking about? These <i>are</i> my good shoes.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,Pardon?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,These are the normal shoes of heaven and Earth.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,These aren't casual at all! Every soldier wears sandals in Angel Land, Meia.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,These Tarakkians sound awful. Are they really so strict?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,My armorer? The only armorer I have is this one nice Centurion and whatever I find in chests...


#losing tunic
3-stripped=stripped,I took 'em off, see? No need to get mad.
3-stripped=stripped,What's the matter? There's nothing on my tunic, is there?
3-stripped=stripped,You seem disappointed. I'm not exactly a strip poker expert, okay?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripped,Y-You really like my feet? I don't know what's so special about them...
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998=stripped,W-What? I'm not hiding anything! Don't say things like that!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,W-What? Was it something I said, Uravity?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I don't really know what "pankratiatic" means. Is that a good thing, or are you making fun of me?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,That's probably for the best, Ladybug.
3-must_strip_winning=shy,I guess it's not so bad when you're all stripped too.
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:morrigan=annoyed,P-Please don't rub it in. I know all too well my wings can't help me...
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,W-What is it now? Should I be worried... I mean, more than I am already?
3-must_strip_normal=embarrassed,Oh no.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:morrigan=annoyed,P-Please don't rub it in. I know all too well my wings can't help me...
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,W-What is it now? Should I be worried... I mean, more than I am already?
3-must_strip_losing=sad,Why me?
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,W-What is it now? Should I be worried... I mean, more than I am already?
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:morrigan=annoyed,P-Please don't rub it in. I know all too well my wings can't help me...
3-stripping=stripping,I-it's nothing to be ashamed of, right? Lady Palutena says I'm pretty fit.
3-stripping=stripping,I'll be fine... the Wii Fit Trainer says I have a perfectly healthy body...
3-stripping=stripping,Don't be nervous... at least one of them won't mind me topless, right?
3-stripping=stripping,I have an undershirt, but I just want this to be over, so...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=stripping,I guess...but mine's probably not as hype-inducing as yours.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripping,(That's probably true...and you're probably going to size me up against them, aren't you...)
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,I'm glad I have <i>someone</i> I can rely on here.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripping,I don't think so. I'm not a glory hog or anything...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,That's true... Lady Palutena always wonders how I'm still in such good shape despite my diet.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,You don't seem to know any shy men, Meia. Or shyness at all.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,Your little quips aren't helping me, Meia.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia=stripping,I-I'm not self-conscious! I'll show you, space pirate...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,<i>Most</i> men don't care... but I'm not like most men.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,When I'm alone, I wouldn't care so much, Jura... but having women watch me is different.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,M-Maybe I wouldn't have such an issue with it if your expectations weren't so high...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:kyu=stripping,I don't even know how I'm feeling anymore...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripping,I dunno if "treasured" is the right word for it... no one's ever seen me casually shirtless like this.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998=stripping,Lady Palutena's seen me in my underwear once before, but...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:996,count-marinette:1=stripping,That's true. But doesn't make this less embarrassing.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:saki=stripping,W-What was that Saki? You want to... be friends?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripping,<i>C-Cute</i>? You don't mean that, do you?


#lost all clothing
4-stripped=stripped,Who am I kidding... I can barely look you in the eye.
4-stripped=stripped,W-well?
4-stripped=stripped,What's that look supposed to mean?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu,count-palutena:1=stripped,Lady Palutena, please...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998=stripped,Um... well... how do I look?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,count-palutena:1=stripped,I-It's not like that! I was mortally wounded!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki=stripped,I don't have many friends, honestly. So I'd be happy to be friends with you.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,I think you'd be surprised how roomy my tunic is, Rinkah.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,I, uh, get it custom made, Rinkah.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Not really any different from normal, Rinkah. The tunic's made to fit.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=embarrassed,(S-So she meant it? I... this is a new thing for me. Ohhh, what do I do now?)
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:996,count-marinette:1=stripped,I think you've lost me.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripped,B-Beauty? T-Thanks, I guess. <i>If</i> you really mean that.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,These are genuine wings, yeah...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,All angels have wings. I thought that was common sense...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,If nothing else, I'm proud of these wings. Useless as they are.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,Thanks, Ladybug. It means a lot to me.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,I don't quite know what that means, but thank you anyway.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=stripped,A photoshoot? I guess that's <i>one</i> way to get used to all this nudity. I'll, uh, consider it.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Do you... really need my help with that? I don't even know if I have this "angel-jizz" you're looking for...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,I hope you have more confidence in yourself than that...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,H-Hold up a minute, Ami! I've only just met you!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:9=stripped,At least one of you is enjoying this.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,I'm not quite sure what you mean... I didn't bring any food with me...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=stripped,I'm sure anyone would treasure it... you're very pretty.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:ami,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stripped,A photoshoot? I mean, I know I'm sexy, but am I really photoshoot material?
4-must_strip_winning=awkward,Shoot, I thought I was safe from having to get naked.
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,H-How can I be happy at a time like this? Sure I'm not the worst off, but still!
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,Come over there? Why?
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=embarrassed,Come over there? Why?
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Yeah yeah, don't have to rub it in...
4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:morrigan=shy,I'd be surprised if this has happened to you more than on-wait, did you call me cute?
4-must_strip_normal=loss,I don't like the looks you're all giving me...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Yeah yeah, don't have to rub it in...
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:morrigan=shy,I'd be surprised if this has happened to you more than on-wait, did you call me cute?

4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,H-How can I be happy at a time like this?
4-must_strip_losing=embarrassed,I had a dream like this once... but the real thing's way worse!
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Yeah yeah, don't have to rub it in...
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,H-How can I be happy at a time like this? Especially since I'm the only one losing a lot...
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=embarrassed,Come over there? Why?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,Come over there? Why?
4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:morrigan=shy,I'd be surprised if this has happened to you more than on-wait, did you call me cute?
4-stripping=stripping,This is just all-around awful.
4-stripping=stripping,My body isn't ready.
4-stripping=stripping,I'll do it, but please, no peeking...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Uh... what are you doing, Gwen?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,I don't really have a frame of reference for how big it is. Sorry...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,I-I couldn't tell you if mine's big or not. It's the only one I've seen more than once, after all...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,My, uh, "tube" isn't that small, I think... But you can be the judge, if you want.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-halloween_pit:0=stripping,S-Sure, but... I didn't think you'd want a naked guy near you, is all.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripping,Y-Yeah, I am. I wish I could've prevented this, but I'm not focused enough yet...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7,count-halloween_pit:0=stripping,S-Sure, but... I didn't think you'd want a naked guy near you, is all.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,Uh, same. Here goes, I guess...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:996,count-marinette:1=stripping,Uh... exactly what did you think we were, Ladybug?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:998=stripping,I always suspected you'd spy on me in the hot springs.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:7,saidMarker:mahirucheck,notSaidMarker:mahirucheck2,count-halloween_pit:0=stripping,A picture? If that's what Lady Palutena wants, I won't stop her.

4-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripping,I wish this wasn't true, Morrigan...

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

male_removed_accessory=calm,Let's move on now.
female_removed_accessory=thinking,Now, what will the next round bring?


#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
0-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
0-male_removed_accessory=joking,Let's move on now, yeah?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
0-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
0-female_removing_accessory=thinking,Now, what will the next round bring?
0-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Well, I'm certainly glad you had that!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
0-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=sad,You've already lost so much, when I haven't lost at all... I feel bad.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=happy,Oh, I remember that brooch. Good memories.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=beat,I still think you should have brought your aegis, Lady Palutena.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
0-female_removed_accessory=victory,No harm done.
0-female_removed_accessory=pumped,Enough talk. Let's play!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=smug,If you're going to be that upset about it, then I will gladly make sure you lose again!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=awkward,It's kind of a big deal.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=joking,Yeah. Life moves on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, uh... looks good on you, Lady Palutena.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Okay, Jura, let's keep going. I'll win this, one piece at a time! Er, two pieces in this case.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Anyways, what class are you? You seem like you'd be a... Commando.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can tell this is going to just keep happening and happening. Is there a limit on how much she can do this?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.


#lost armbands
1-male_removing_accessory=joking,Great choice, ~name~.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
1-male_removed_accessory=devoted,Just a minor setback.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
1-female_removing_accessory=happy,Smart move. This way, everybody wins!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=sad,You're losing a lot... I feel kind of bad.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=surprised,You're really giving away a lot, Lady Palutena.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=beat,I warned you. You should've brought the aegis.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
1-female_removed_accessory=pumped,Now, let's hope for some good luck in this next round!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=beat,If you say so...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=smug,If you're going to be that upset about it, then I will gladly make sure you lose again!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Okay, Jura, let's keep going. I'll win this, one piece at a time! Er, two pieces in this case.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can tell this is going to just keep happening and happening. Is there a limit on how much she can do this?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Anyways, what class are you? You seem like you'd be a... Commando.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=awkward,That's life for ya.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=pumped,You're right! Life moves on!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=happy,I think it looks good. Maybe try it out more after the game.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!


#lost sash
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
2-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Well, I'm certainly glad you had that!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=surprised,I know you're generous and everything, but there's such a thing as too generous.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=beat,You really should've brought more accessories. I lost all of mine already.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=beat,I feel kind of bad for making you lose so much.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=awkward,Looks good! And we almost sort of match!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Okay, Jura, let's keep going. I'll win this, one piece at a time! Er, two pieces in this case.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Anyways, what class are you? You seem like you'd be a... Commando.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=awkward,That's life for ya.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can tell this is going to just keep happening and happening. Is there a limit on how much she can do this?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=smug,If you're going to be that upset about it, then I will gladly make sure you lose again!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=awkward,Guess that wasn't so bad. Let's keep playing, Lady Palutena.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=shy,Please just be careful.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!


#lost sandals
3-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
3-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Well, I'm certainly glad you had that!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=beat,Oh, right. I forgot you had <i>that</i> brooch.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=beat,I know we're basically tied, but I feel a little bad.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=shy,You're so vulnerable like this. Will you be okay?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can tell this is going to just keep happening and happening. Is there a limit on how much she can do this?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Okay, Jura, let's keep going. I'll win this, one piece at a time! Er, two pieces in this case.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Anyways, what class are you? You seem like you'd be a... Commando.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=shy,Yeah. But I think that's just from me already being barefoot.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=joking,I guess...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=angry,That brooch means a lot to me! Don't just shrug it off!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=victory,Oh, I think I rock the look pretty good, and so do you!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I know, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=awkward,That's life for ya.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=smug,If you're going to be that upset about it, then I will gladly make sure you lose again!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!

4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
4-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
4-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
4-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
4-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
4-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
4-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
4-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
4-female_removing_accessory=awkward,Well, I'm certainly glad you had that!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=beat,You've got a big lead on me, but will you really be fine?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=surprised,I don't think it's such a good idea for you to take off so many things all in a row.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=shy,I know I'm showing way more skin. But I still feel a little bad.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
4-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
4-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=smug,If you're going to be that upset about it, then I will gladly make sure you lose again!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Anyways, what class are you? You seem like you'd be a... Commando.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
4-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Okay, Jura, let's keep going. I'll win this, one piece at a time! Er, two pieces in this case.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=shy,Yeah. But I think that's just from me already being barefoot.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can tell this is going to just keep happening and happening. Is there a limit on how much she can do this?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=awkward,I guess that's life for ya.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=sad,Are you just rubbing in the fact you still have clothes?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=shy,I guess I see...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=beat,I'm just saying. Look at what happened to me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=shy,I know, right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?

-3-male_removing_accessory=thinking,I'm impressed you kept that for so long.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
-3-male_removed_accessory=sad,This is kinda depressing...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
-3-female_removing_accessory=shy,Hey, even if I'm not modest any more, at least you are.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I'm not exactly fit to protect you, Lady Palutena... will you be okay?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=surprised,You really didn't need to give away all of that, Lady Palutena.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=shy,Stripping my boss, while I'm naked myself... feels a little bad, you know?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=smug,If you're going to be that upset about it, then I will gladly make sure you lose again!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=annoyed,I can tell this is going to just keep happening and happening. Is there a limit on how much she can do this?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,Anyways, what class are you? You seem like you'd be a... Commando.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=smug,Okay, Jura, let's keep going. I'll win this, one piece at a time! Er, two pieces in this case.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=shy,Does it have to move on?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,Being nude, on the other hand, not so much.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=beat,Alright... maybe these guys will be too distracted by me, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=shy,Yeah. But I think that's just from me already being barefoot.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=devoted,I think it suits you. I'd take that same outfit now, if I could.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=shy,When do I get my winnings?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?

-2-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Jeez, I didn't even get your ~clothing~ off.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
-2-male_removed_accessory=thinking,Maybe it was a mistake to come here.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
-2-female_removing_accessory=surprised,Are you trying to spite me or something?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:6-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore. R-Really...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shy,I've fought bats before. I'm not scared...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=surprised,This is making me feel so... bad.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=shy,I'm... a little busy right now.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=surprised,But... but... you really don't have to...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
-2-female_removed_accessory=beat,I think I'm gonna take a long nap after this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=loss,Yeah... wouldn't be right for you to lose so easily...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=shy,Yeah. But I think that's just from me already being barefoot.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I wish you weren't right about that...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=shy,I think I'm a bit <i>too</i> comfortable right now...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=devoted,And I'm glad it isn't.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=sad,I clearly can't beat you in this game after all...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=surprised,G-Geez... so condescending...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=annoyed,Can you start sending some wins my way, please?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=sad,You're probably loving this, aren't you? I got beat so badly...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=shy,Let's, uh, keep going. At this rate, I'm wondering if I'm just bad or Jura's just that good...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=joking,I would say you're being overconfident, but you've already beaten me super bad...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad,(How did someone who can't even speak decent English beat me so bad?)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Bad time to be asking that question, Lady Palutena!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=sad,How did this woman beat me so bad...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!

-1-male_removing_accessory=surprised,Wow, I'm bad.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:0=calm,Take your time, buddy.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,I don't think it's normal to wear a harness to card games.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=devoted,Right. Just relax! (If only I could follow my own advice.)
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=devoted,Only you can make taking off boots this exciting.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=pumped,An adaptable opponent? Should be interesting!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:0=stunned,I thought you were a spaghetti chef?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=surprised,(I've never seen him without the helmet... what'll he look like?)
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:florina=happy,Don't be too hard on each other, now.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=pumped,YEAH! COME ON!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=stunned,Er, yes. That is how belts work.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:4=sad,You held on for so long, only to lose it at the end... tragic.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=awkward,Guess it's a bit silly to get worked up over a cape, isn't it?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,Really? I haven't noticed.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:5=thinking,You sure? I can help, if something's the matter.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that looks neat. Wonder if it'd match well with my tunic.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,Then why wear them, Cappy?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,How <i>glovely</i>.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=pumped,Ah, there it is! There's the Captain I know!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:0=smug,The easy choice.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=happy,Ah, martial arts belts. More interesting than a plain ol' belt, but still not as cool as a utility belt.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:0=joking,I mean, have you ever seen a monk wearing boots?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=awkward,Yeah, having your clothes blown away by near death is <i>not</i> fun.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:0=joking,I've seen those up close more than I'd ever like.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=stunned,I didn't know this was an ad. Hold on... am I on TV?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=beat,Those are some stylish boots. The pink is a little bold, though.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=stunned,Are you bringing in food?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=thinking,Black Trigger? Fujin? Border? This is a lot to process all at once...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=joking,Alright, alright.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:link,targetStage:0=annoyed,Yes, yes, your gloves are impressive.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=joking,Don't look at me. I'm just an angel.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,<i>That's</i> your preferred name? Sorry, it's just easier to say 9s.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:0=joking,No need to hide your identity here. Pretty much everyone shows themselves off, I think.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=beat,What happened to loving thy neighbor?
-1-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,Good for you, I guess.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:1=smug,We'll see about that, Caleb.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:6=awkward,That's all? How cute.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=annoyed,Can't say I hate it... yet.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=smug,Oh, so you have eyes after all.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=thinking,O....kay? Dunno how a shield will help, but go ahead.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=calm,I agree. Gloves do seem pretty unnecessary for this type of game.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:7=stunned,Wow... didn't think you'd look so...rugged.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=calm,Fighting fair, huh? Respectable.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=beat,I hope that's the case. I really do...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=stunned,Nines is a good one. Can we use that?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:5=calm,At least you have your dignity.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:caleb,targetStage:2=joking,Heehee.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=thinking,Wait, can you even make spaghetti with your non-moving arms?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=happy,Ah, that makes a lot more sense. Want to have a Blade fight sometime?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:1=thinking,...That's it? Man of few words, I guess.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:2=beat,Ouch. Ice levels are the worst.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:2=happy,Hey, I know a Yoshi too! Mind if I call you that?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:4=beat,It's weird seeing the boots come off. I'm so used to them flying at my face.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Come on. That was a good one!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:1=sad,Playing with this guy was a bad idea. I'm going to get hungry <i>so</i> fast.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=beat,Man, pauldrons like that are so cool. If only they weren't so heavy...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:3=pumped,All you need to know is you're Fred, and you're going to lose this game!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:link,targetStage:1=pumped,Enjoy shooting arrows bare-handed!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:2=angry,I do too. C'mon dealer!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kira,targetStage:3=pumped,Try sitting cross-legged. That'd probably help.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:fred,targetStage:1=smug,It's not the <i>boots</i> we're after.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=joking,Hi, Lady Palutena! Can you see me?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryu,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm not used to seeing you in such a casual setting. It's almost nice.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=thinking,(I have a sudden craving for eggs. Where'd that come from?)
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=beat,Never knew you were such a pushover when it comes to this stuff.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Seems you two get along really well. I'm glad for you.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=joking,I'd like to give a shout-out to the Kid Icarus fans out there! Thank you for believing in me!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,You're taking this really casually, huh? Maybe I should too...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=angry,I knew it! You and Ms. Camera Hat are in on it together!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_threat=shy,I'd like a refresher on your powers too, if you don't mind.
-1-female_removing_accessory=shy,I'm glad you kept that until now.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=thinking,Value has nothing to do with it... does it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:0=stunned,A studded choker? It almost seems more like a collar.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=smug,Not as cool as angel jewels, probably!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2=beat,This "pervert" business is getting old fast.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:asuna=thinking,I wonder how your goddess and Lady Palutena would get along.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=surprised,B-blood?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=joking,Makes sense. It's best to not show any unnecessary skin, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:0=thinking,So how does earthbending work? Is it just making rocks move?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, what a nice locket.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:0=awkward,I see jewelry is prized equally between elves and humans. And angels.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=happy,The shoes, huh? That seems a solid first option.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=smug,That rapier is so low-tech! You can't even use it for long range combat.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:0=awkward,Is this an alternate skin? Like Pitoo?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=awkward,I'm impressed you can dance with those on.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=beat,A bit thick for a bracelet, isn't it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:0=smug,Lightsabers are cool, but can they shoot energy bullets?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=stunned,Really? I wanna see!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:0=calm,What else is new?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=annoyed,Oh yes. What a shame.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh! That was... fast.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=thinking,Those stick things?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=joking,What a mixed bag of fashion.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=stunned,I'm suprised, you actually have restraint.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=annoyed,So much for better...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, right! That's a good idea.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shy,I've fought bats before. I'm not scared...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=surprised,Who allowed this? You aren't even trying to hide it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh! Now I remember! Shulk's buddy, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:3=stunned,O-oh. I guess that works. Anyone have a problem with it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:0=loss,Bit bright...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=devoted,I'm more of a sandals guy myself.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Gotta agree. Definitely Japanese name.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:2=awkward,So much for my weightless theory.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=smug,Good. You wouldn't want to make an enemy of me! Or even Marinette!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:0=calm,Yep, there they go. (C'mon Pit, can you really think of nothing better to say?)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:4=awkward,You probably didn't need that anyway.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=awkward,Shoes are good. Plus it's more comfortable!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=victory,Sayonara, boots!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,Ooh! Does that mean I might be invisible on film too? Because that would be <i>the best</i>.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=joking,I can make a joke for you! Hey, so you see how it's just been accessories from Harley so far?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=annoyed,At least you can <i>fly</i> on your own...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=awkward,And I like breezy tunics. What diverse senses of style we have! We could have a fashion show.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=joking,I'm glad. Not everything has to be big, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=surprised,Off?! That's the last thing I want!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=happy,Is BLADE a weapon company? Maybe that's where Bayonetta gets those guns of hers...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:3=devoted,Eh, you don't need that anyway. Lady Palutena's blessings would be more than enough.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=happy,Kind of small, but yeah, that works.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=calm,I'm less disappointed than you think.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,So like me and Dark Pit?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=beat,Your biological father? Yeah, good thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=thinking,Expensive? Even though they look like papier-mache?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0=joking,Good first pick, I agree.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=awkward,Don't be nervous. We're all friends... we <i>are</i> friends, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=joking,I think it adds a bit of girlish charm.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=shy,You're much braver than us Skyworld folk.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=joking,But then you'd become the punk, Tracer! And you're too nice for that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=sad,Why do humans get to play with all the fun gadgets...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=annoyed,I wasn't that worked up.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=happy,Finally running out, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=shy,Phew. You gave me a mini-heart attack there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=beat,Welp, this is going to be a looooong game.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=stunned,I thought you were the only one who would wear that many belts.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:0=smug,Haha! I don't even have to say anything!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=awkward,I always thought yo-yos were a terrible weapon. But if Kirby and Ness can make it work, I guess anyone can.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=smug,That's right! Captain of Lady Palutena's guard, at your service! Oh, but I don't use yo-yos. That's more of Kirby and Ness's thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:3=happy,Oh! You wear sandals too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=stunned,And the socks, too? That'll make this go faster, at least. Thanks!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=calm,There you go! I'm proud of you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Do you really care about something stupid like that?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh, poor you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:aimee=sad,If I had known so many people would bring weapons, I would've brought my bow.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=thinking,(Kind of reminds me of Lady Palutena and her fashionable footwear. Guess that type of fashion exists everywhere.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,Sure, go ahead.No one's stopping you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,(Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought I could hear her heartbeat for a moment.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I thought those boots would be... dirtier, honestly.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:0=surprised,That's a lotta gear... you <i>were</i> here to play cards, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=shy,Are you giving them to us? ...How, uh... thoughtful?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=happy,There you go! Shoes are a perfectly viable choice now!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=surprised,It sounds like you live in the Underworld or something.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:april,targetStage:0=annoyed,Is a belt even necessary with a jumpsuit?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Yeesh... no need to throw down the gauntlet.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=happy,Just in time, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=happy,Oh yeah! Your clothes are alive or something, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:0=stunned,Huh. An ascot with a rose on it? That's cool. Overcomplicated, but cool.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0=beat,You don't seem to care that much. But then again, they're only gloves.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:0=beat,I'm no expert in fashion, but are hot pink shades really something one girl can signature?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=awkward,I've never seen someone so attached to their boots.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:0=smug,Serves you right.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:0=devoted,Kicking off shoes after a hard day's work is a great feeling.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=annoyed,Don't apologize! You did nothing wrong.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=joking,Did this loss throw you for a loop? ...Maybe a belt loop?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=annoyed,I hope you aren't planning on using all three of those separately.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=joking,I mean, I won't argue it, but...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Ah, a belt enthusiast. You'd get along great with Lady Palutena!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska=determined,This... totally isn't foreboding at all! Nope, no way!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not worried. If you have the confidence to joke, you're fine.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,It'd be worth it, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=thinking,I wonder about that...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Not a fan of the limelight?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=calm,Take your time. A belt like that's harmless enough.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=shy,Quite a portfolio you have there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:0=thinking,Is it really guessing if you're already doing it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0=calm,The obvious choice. Have you played before, Princess?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=smug,Yes and no. One particular clown tried to kill me with a foot that was three times my size! But he wasn't wearing shoes... what were we talking about?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=stunned,(That's actually the coolest helmet I've ever seen.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=annoyed,The right choice, maybe. But not a very exciting one.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=thinking,Tarts...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=devoted,Oh, thank goodness.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=joking,If you won't make the joke, I will: the gloves are coming off!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:3=thinking,Your belt? You don't sound too sure about it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:harley=thinking,There's a distinction? I would <i>never</i> have passed clown college.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=beat,Is this Webmaster watching now?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:0=devoted,Boots are always a reasonable first choice.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=smug,Everyone knows capes are out of fashion! Get with the times!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=thinking,Those are some thick leather boots. Like the type Magnus would wear.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=awkward,That's all you, ~player~.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma=surprised,H-Hey, that wasn't me!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=angry,How dare you! Only Lady Palutena should be owed respect!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=beat,I guess we all have some useless trinket or another.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1=awkward,Obvious is subjective... but yes, that's what I'd have picked, too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=pumped,I've fought bats before. Do you think I'd be here if I was scared?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=thinking,"Usually"?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:3=shy,Want is a strong word...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=smug,I know a few people who'd like to see those Jet Boots go, and not for dirty reasons.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=happy,I like the straw hat. I wish I had one for my days off.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:0=annoyed,Stalling with a sudden extra piece would be unfair. <i>That</i> would be borderline unfun.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=beat,Uh...good choice? Not really sure what else to say.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=smug,Ammo? Seriously? So low-tech.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:annie=beat,She's a grown woman. Budding doesn't really fit her.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Someone like that <i>does</i> sound interesting. Never met a fire-slinging human before.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:7=awkward,Whoops.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=beat,Those are called headphones? I thought they were ear mufflers.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=happy,Wanna compare? I bet I have more.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=joking,I could have sworn the sleeves were part of the dress. Shows how much I know about fashion.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=thinking,In what world would they not?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too. More than you could ever know.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=awkward,I always wondered if those suits were comfortable.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gogo=awkward,Can you blame her?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:palutena=thinking,Lady Palutena, if mortals can use light magic just fine, why can't I?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=joking,I bet you're <i>sweating</i> now.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:0=pumped,I can handle any punishment... not that I'm trying to look up your skirt.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:3=joking,Aw, but I was a fan of the zebra look.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=beat,I dunno. Trailtails are pretty bad, too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:0=awkward,Ah, shoes. A boring yet practical choice.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=awkward,Really, it's not even surprising anymore. R-Really...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:0=calm,Hm. Okay.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=shy,The whole waistband?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=stunned,Wow, you have a stripping sequence pre-programmed? Awesome!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=beat,And into the corner they go.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:0=angry,This better not be canon! I have a reputation to keep!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, those boots really suit you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, nice. Sandals!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:0=awkward,I guess this <i>is</i> no big deal for a model, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=angry,Don't be badmouthing the utility belt! They're called that for a reason.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=annoyed,Psssh. Show-off.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:1=devoted,(Thank you, management!)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=beat,Keeping it brief? That's cool.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=victory,Good-bye!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:3=calm,Ah... what a cute necklace.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=awkward,Well, I got beat pretty hard. Not unexpected, but still makes me feel bad.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=awkward,Package deal? Not dragging this out, huh? Respectable.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=surprised,I think you're being just a bit too generous with what you're taking off.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:0=pumped,The gloves are coming off!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=sad,Aw, but that's, like, the best part!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=loss,Not again...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:0=beat,Slow start. Not that that's a bad thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=beat,Shoes, huh? That's cool...c'mon, anything?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Normie? I don't get it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:0=calm,Yes. Are you paying attention?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=awkward,Heh... kind of impressive you made it this far unscathed. You'll be fine, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:elaine=happy,Not surprising. You seem the prudish type.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=calm,That's the logical choice. You're into that sort of thing, I think?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=beat,Oh, I didn't even realize you had that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stunned,There was a Dark Age of the Law? That sounds rough.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=calm,So there goes the helmet, I guess. Are you going to make it fly away or something?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1,marker:puns=smug,Time to win us some boot-y!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,How about I laugh at myself instead?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=happy,Ha! Just try and kill an angel. (Finishing me on the other hand...)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=awkward,Not as easy as my sandals, I bet.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=thinking,Does this count as a coup?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,Nice little recap.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Maybe you should from time to time.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=angry,Your tricoder is a <i>filthy liar!</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=annoyed,Might want to keep an eye on it. Never know with these types.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:0=happy,Sure.Take ten.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,Let me guess: something something gloves are off.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:7=sad,Ai-yai-yaina...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Sockin' it to ya!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Maybe this Edgeworth is just an outlier.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=surprised,Why are you looking at my wings as you say that?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=happy,It's fine. Scarves are overrated.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=awkward,Whatever gives you <i>piece</i> of mind.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:palutenacall=annoyed,Well, now I want to see it. What's it called?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=happy,You have a good heart, Ms. Fey. Don't worry, if something happens tonight, I'll take care of this Maya.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_first_time_playing=calm,Your first time too? Guess we can learn together!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh! That's a neat trick.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:5=joking,Ah, glad you could find something.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,We're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. The boots. Easy enough.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=awkward,Don't I know it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, guess that's a decent choice.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:0=annoyed,You're acting like we aren't even here!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:scarlet_witch,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=calm,Just for now indeed.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Ah! A classic.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=thinking,Uh, ew?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=beat,Oh yeah. How'd that happen?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=sad,I wish I knew how to tie ribbons like that. It's embarrassing to be an army captain who can't tie a solid knot.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=joking,I always thought that thing would be trouble to wear.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,Lucky's one word for it. I can think of a few more.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=smug,Haha! No more utility belt for you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:amalia=awkward,(I just visualized Viridi with a bunch of Toad lackeys...maximum annoyance factor.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, a belt. Very good.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:0=joking,I know, right? What'll people say when they see your possible bedhead?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=happy,Those pants seem tight enough to keep them from falling, at least.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=thinking,Are they? They don't look very soft.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,She has a point, Revy. You should relax.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:0=thinking,Yes, you <i>did</i> lose...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,Well, since you brought up obvious choices earlier...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=devoted,Oh, an apron! Are you a chef?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=thinking,Isn't having all your fingers normal?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=calm,Stuffy is one word for it. I would have personally gone with 'heavy'.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=smug,What's the matter? <i>Surely</i> the mighty Sonya can handle something as simple as this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=sad,I feel like I'm being left out.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=stunned,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=stunned,Whoa. Deja vu.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=stunned,Already? It feels like you just started!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:1=sad,Gross...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=awkward,You don't need a hat anyways. Or maybe you do. What do you have dominion over again?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=awkward,Coming here in a dress coat <i>will</i> do that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:raven=awkward,Definitely, with that coat.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=thinking,Well, you wore it here, so you probably have some use for it. Unlike Sei.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=joking,Shame. Now you'll have to bare it... your hair. I meant your hair.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=thinking,I'm sorry, your what now?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=beat,Join the club.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=thinking,Are those fur boots?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Glad you're looking out for her, Cappy. Even the cold ones need love, you know?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=smug,I just roll out of bed ready to go. Perk of having short hair!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=happy,That's why I wear a laurel crown.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:0=awkward,And I suppose I'll be over here, waiting to move on.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking,Just boring old shoes? I expected more from a love fairy.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking,Strange looking bracelets. Wouldn't they get in the way?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, Lady Palutena wears multiple belts too!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=thinking,Are those even shorts? They're basically just the undies superheroes wear on the outside of their costumes.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:0=stunned,Wait, do they? I should've brought my bow...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=thinking,Does that collar even go to anything? Or is it just, y'know, dangling there?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=beat,What a thick scarf. I bet it feels wonderful to take it off.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,And so you are.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:0=joking,You don't need sunglasses in a place like this. Unless this is secretly a beach and no one told me.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1,marker:puns=calm,Now debooting...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=shy,I... wasn't worried at all!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=victory,A small victory, but I'll take it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,I wouldn't be surprised if she did. She seems like the type. Oh, uh, no offense, Sei.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=awkward,You could try playing one-handed... or sitting down.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=calm,You wouldn't think that outfit would require a belt.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:0=smug,See? You're not so hot.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:4=smug,Ah, you had me going for a minute there! Clever, Zoey!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=shy,How... obedient of you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=joking,Don't rag on her too hard. She's not even using her camera as an item.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=awkward,Ah, you don't need gloves for that. Really, throwing them isn't hard.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:0=awkward,Going without socks isn't so bad. I've never worn a  pair in my life.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=calm,Don't worry, you still get to keep a gauntlet.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:0=surprised,That's not code for something bad, right? Like, you won't pull a bait-and-switch and take off your pants or something?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:0=smug,Lady Palutena wears a choker too. Of course, yours is nowhere near as nice.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=beat,Everything counts here.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,That was rude, Revy. Shame on you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=awkward,More like a loincloth, but it's not really clothing any loins, is it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:zizou=thinking,That... makes no sense.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:1=angry,I am calm! Who's not calm?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:0=shy,Do you know how much that hurts?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Guess even heroes have their copycats.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=annoyed,Hmm. Maybe I'm just used to standing around.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=annoyed,D-Don't be so c-cocky!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:0=stunned,Really? What's it say?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:3=stunned,Dibs!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kira=happy,Okay, that claim might actually be justified.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=beat,Nylon's kind of an awkward word, isn't it? And it looks awkward to wear, too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=angry,You leave the sacred buns out of this!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=joking,Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0=beat,Except it kind of is...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:0=happy,Good thing it didn't blow up on you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking,As far as I can tell, that's basically a broken  pair of glasses. Why do you have that?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:5=annoyed,The glasses. Oh, goody, I wasn't aware my birthday came early.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=joking,I think you're tripping over your words.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=smug,A poor craftsman blames his tools, right? Same idea here.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,totalMales:4=thinking,Are you okay? You don't look too pleased.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:0=beat,I dunno. Maybe I should've brought my bow to check.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=smug,Wanna have a race some time? I can be pretty fast too, y'know!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=awkward,Every magician's gota have a hat! It's a law, or something.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=awkward,Pretty sure it'll be awkward either way.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4=smug,(You totally did forget them.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=thinking,So I'm guessing you don't share memories with the other you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=thinking,If that's supposed to be lucky, I'm not seeing it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:5=awkward,I didn't forget. (But it would've been nice...)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:4=annoyed,Oh. Right. Those are a thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:0=beat,I can't really see how heavy gloves are supposed to be practical.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=joking,We can do without the whole plan, thank you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=victory,I should've expected you wouldn't be fazed by this!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=beat,Well, you wouldve had to remove it anyway if you wanted to take off the shirt.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=thinking,Bit high-tech for just a gauntlet, isn't it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm guessing that bag's totally green, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=beat,Fine then! I'll, uh, earn it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=thinking,So what was that about a trump card?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=shy,...Did you just call yourself a cow?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=beat,Just what I needed in my life. Stuck in a game with two huge nerds.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=awkward,You're kind of just letting her walk all over you, ~player~.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:0=thinking,Maybe you're more "Space Pirate" instead.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:0=stunned,So you're <i>not</i> Peach.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:0=joking,Sure, but how long until they're <i>Mist</i>?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=stunned,(Wow. So disinterested.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:0=smug,Ah yes. How engrossing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=thinking,Do you mind if I see those after the game? I want to find something that can help me resist ice physics.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0=thinking,...And she's gone. Is she coming back?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=smug,Not so lucky, is it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,totalRounds:0=stunned,The very first loss, and you're going for two at once? You must be really confident!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=happy,Glove us up, Shazza!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=beat,Yawn...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=stunned,Oh, I was right? <i>Cool</i>.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=happy,I like the speckled pattern on your tie. Matches your hair. Well, almost.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=joking,Are you gonna make the joke, or should I?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=beat,Oh yeah. I've been to the Spear Pillar before. It <i>does</i> get pretty chilly up there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=calm,It's literally impossible for me to be disappointed, Daria.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=thinking,Was that supposed to be taken as a joke?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:0=smug,Good! You shouldn't be bothered by that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=annoyed,Am I going to have to leave again?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=thinking,I'm surprised that necklace has sentimental value for you. I took you for the "different necklace for each hour of the day" type.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:2=surprised,Huh? Three more what?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=surprised,Huh? Your hair's suddenly blue... what's going on?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,Now doesn't seem like the best time to have tea and shoot the breeze.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:4=happy,Oh, it does!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:4=calm,Oh thank goodness.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:may,targetStage:0,marker:puns=smug,That first? <i>Sneaky</i> choice there.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=joking,They're just boots, you know. It's not the end of the world.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=pumped,Don't you worry. Fighting with all I got is what I'm best at!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=happy,Sure thing, Rinkah! I'm sure Magnus would be happy to fight you. Might not be cheap, though...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0=beat,How'd that happen? Isn't he Guybrush's lackey or something?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=thinking,That doesn't look like any necklace I've ever seen. I'm used to pure gold, not... whatever that's made of.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah yeah, add insult to injury. At least it's your injury, in this case.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=sad,Why do you try and take off the shirt by default...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=thinking,Come to think of it, don't ladies come to these games more often? How'd we end up with just Mahiru at our table?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:0=joking,I hope we're not going hiking... my sandals are built with mobility in mind, not grip.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=awkward,You guess? I mean, it's the best option, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:0=beat,I know I said I'd pay attention, but c'mon.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,I hope you mean your <i>own</i> palace.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smug,Holsters are a waste of space anyway. Why don't you learn to use magic?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=beat,It's courtesy in a lot of places, but in this case, it's just the toll for losing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=thinking,Was it a literal butt-kicking?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=smug,I doubt many people have seen anything like this party we have here.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=awkward,Bah, shoe type doesn't matter if you can fly!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=happy,You know, I wouldn't mind a pair of gloves like those.
-1-female_removed_accessory=sad,Maybe this just isn't my type of game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=shy,I wouldn't like a free eyeful anyway. Don't be like Moon over there.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=joking,Isn't that the whole point behind accessories?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:2=beat,Pretty sure that'd be cheating.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad you're a nice clown. I've known so many evil ones, I was starting to hate them!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=beat,Hmm... what happens when you boost alcohol? Whatever it becomes is probably dangerous.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:2=happy,Well, I love the feeling of being barefoot if that's what you meant.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=shy,Yeah. But I think that's just from me already being barefoot.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3=annoyed,I'll keep an eye out. Make sure no one pilfers them.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=sad,How did this woman beat me so bad...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:1=beat,What a great prize.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:1=calm,Well, you don't seem all that different.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=awkward,I mean, I never asked. But sure.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=smug,How fitting.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=beat,I mean, that's about what I expected, but...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=awkward,Wow, you chose the ~clothing~? How funny.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uhura,targetStage:2=joking,That's probably more accurate. Who is it, I wonder?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=shy,So next is the dress. Hoo boy...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=thinking,...Oh. Ew.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:1=angry,Where does that leave me?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad,(How did someone who can't even speak decent English beat me so bad?)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:2=stunned,Come to think of it, <i>my</i> weapons give me stat boosts instead of my clothes. Why is that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=beat,Yeah, look on the bright side of things. You'll live longe-uh, never mind.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Good to know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should've layered up more.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=thinking,Wait, what would a hero like you need a utility belt for? Is there anything small enough to fit in there that's fitting to your powers?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=surprised,G-Geez... so condescending...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=sad,...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:3=shy,I just won't say anything.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=happy,You ever feel the clouds beneath your bare feet? <i>That's</i> a nice feeling.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=happy,There's some beauty in simplicity. It's like bringing retro back!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:5=calm,Great! Let's keep going.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=sad,You wouldn't go down easily, would you... wish I could say the same...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=devoted,Joke's on you, I come from a magical world!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:1=happy,It takes a lot to disappoint me. You're fine.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=joking,I would say you're being overconfident, but you've already beaten me super bad...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=sad,I clearly can't beat you in this game after all...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,Guess I have to wait and see.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:1=smug,That's why we're playing, aren't we?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=calm,It seems you won't be deterred, even now. I can respect that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tifa,targetStage:3=shy,I don't doubt that, Tifa. You <i>are</i> using the literal, sense of the term, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:1=happy,Just how I like it!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=calm,They're okay, but they'll never hold a candle to the golden jewelry of Skyworld.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:3=happy,I'm not a thief, don't worry about that. I'm sure you'll get it back.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=devoted,Say, I was thinking... does your power work on people, too? Because I kind of wanted to see if someone other than Lady Palutena could help me fly...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:4=awkward,Sorry, but I can't really say much about that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=beat,I get you have an ego the size of a pirate ship, but that's no reason to drag this out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=sad,I think I'm a bit <i>too</i> comfortable, after that...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma=beat,I wasn't- never mind. Can we just go to the next hand, please?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=beat,Good to know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=sad,You're probably loving this, aren't you? I got beat so badly...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=shy,Let's, uh, keep going. At this rate, I'm wondering if I'm just bad or Jura's just that good...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=happy,I bet it's pretty old, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=beat,You're the boss.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:2=awkward,The belt, or my joke? Be honest.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,You hate desert worlds too?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=calm,(She's surprisingly airheaded, but I'm not saying that to her face.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Onto the next level.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=thinking,And now we're back on track... I think.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:3=awkward,Heh heh. Funny.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:8=shy,(Maybe I should've said something earlier.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=beat,Don't expect me to be doing any exercises. You're not my doctor.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:2=happy,I can relate. Wish mine were off right now...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:angie,targetStage:1=beat,Not like you at all. You're... very blunt.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=thinking,Honest question, how many people have actually called you a sailor?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:1=pumped,Maybe next hand will be a much bigger <i>deal</i>.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I once controlled the body of a little girl. Long story. Anyway, you remind me of her right now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, you'll let us borrow your choker?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:2=shy,Please don't spank me. I swear I've been a good boy!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=smug,Messy hair's not bad. You think I ever use a comb?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:2=awkward,Looks like you lost a few inches.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:1=happy,Well, shoe-t. Let's get back to the game, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:3=pumped,And now you'll fight at full strength, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:1=pumped,Next hand, next hand!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=surprised,Where have I heard that phrase before?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Why would you give it away? Seems like a waste to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3=joking,Don't take it so personal.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=awkward,Oh. I dunno, I think the orange is a good look!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=beat,(I thought I felt the faintest presence of magic for a second, but I guess it was nothing.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:3=beat,I bet. There's a reason Lightweight is Lady Palutena's favorite power.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1,marker:palutenacall=awkward,Would shoes ever qualify as big? Ooh, maybe if someone wore them as their underwear?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=pumped,Nah, there's no such thing as too excessive!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:1=sad,I probably don't wanna know who that is, do I?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=happy,I bet that scarf would make a great headband. Mind if I try?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=happy,DO YOU LOVE HOT SPRINGS TOO? Will you marry me?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=awkward,I doubt they will. No one moves from their spot anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=awkward,Just a moderate amount of sexy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought a lawyer could be so polite.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=awkward,That's good to hear. I <i>do</i> hate cold floors.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:3=calm,After you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yes, you've made your point.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=smug,You're just like Ryu told me! This is going to be fun.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=calm,You're fine, Chiaki. You've got plenty of HP left.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:6=happy,And now everything is the way it should be.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Still, it was the smart choice. Good job!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:4=happy,You can say she's <i>Harley</i> stripped yet.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=happy,But hey, no hat hair!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=happy,Aww, they're so cute! Why would you keep this a secret?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:4=surprised,N-not that I was ogling them or anything.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:2=calm,Not particularly, Blake.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:3=surprised,N-now's not the time or place!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe it's a good thing you didn't bring it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:6=shy,(Er, there aren't really eight people here, are there?)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:1=annoyed,(What an infuriating woman.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=beat,A pony complimenting the ponytail? That's new.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, I'm not opposed. But the others might take issue.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=shy,What's the conversion rate on hearts to GP?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:1=stunned,Already trying to seduce us? Don't give into it, ~player~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=sad,Not that I'm one to talk...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:1=awkward,For a clown, that was a really short show.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3=beat,I get squeamish around blood. Even doctors freak me out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=calm,Good for you. Moving on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=angry,Stop.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=smug,I'm sorry. You'll need to insert one quarter to continue.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=beat,So you're really not human? That explains so much...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,You've been unarmed... un-yo'd?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,You don't know who they are? You need to play more video games. Or at least watch a Smash tourney!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=awkward,Really? Maybe I oughta start wearing a wrist strap.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma_classic,targetStage:6=shy,That's probably for the best.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:4=smug,I could say the same to you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:2=joking,Sorry, even just mentioning the word "ballet" makes me sleepy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay! Let's keep going, before her luck kicks in!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chara,targetStage:1=thinking,That's weird... why do I feel like your defense went way down?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,I hope we all have good luck. But I hope I have slightly better luck.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:3=pumped,Big ego. Shame it'll all come crashing down.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:2=smug,We'll see.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:4=smug,I'd be impressed if you didn't lose again, Calisto. Can you pull it off?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=smug,Let's keep going. Maybe we can pull a <i>hat trick</i> on DMG!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sonya,targetStage:2=awkward,Heh.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=determined,I'm serious, by the way.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:2=sad,Suddenly I don't want to play anymore.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=happy,Bit messy under there. Not anywhere close to mine, but still, not bad.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:2=thinking,Is this a riddle? ...Can I have a hint?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,Do you live in a volcano or something? Because that would be <i>awesome</i>!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1=calm,How about I thank you now.... thanks.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1,marker:puns=pumped,I bet you being here <i>maid</i> his day!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,A Flame Tribe woman? Does that mean you have some sort of magic fire powers?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=happy,So if you're from the Flame Tribe, does that mean you can set your weapons on fire and stuff? That'd be cool!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=devoted,As a member of the Flame Tribe, do you get cool perks? Like shooting fire from your hands and stuff?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:2=happy,No, seriously. Annnnnnnnnnnnd?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=happy,You've got a nice style! Maybe you should wear your hair like that a bit more often!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=beat,Sheesh. It's just a scarf, dude.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:1=beat,Is someone really that much of a degenerate?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:2=awkward,I guess this is okay. But next time... oh boy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:3=victory,Glad you're not dragging this out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=angry,The management's actually making this interesting. It wouldn't be satisfying to beat an opponent who isn't trying!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:2=happy,Good! I mean, right! Moving on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=pumped,Haha! She said it for me!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:2=shy,You don't wear socks? Doesn't that get uncomfortable in boots like those?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=shy,I hope TM01 is in that bag. I'm going to have to work myself up to handle... this.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=surprised,...<i>What</i> game are you from, again?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:penny,targetStage:1=calm,In a roundabout way.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:2=beat,I barely even noticed them. I don't exactly go around watching ears.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:1=pumped,You're just getting started after all!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pauling,targetStage:1=calm,Let's play a guessing game. What do you all think she'll take off next?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:4=pumped,Time for stalling's over. Now we play for real!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:paya,targetStage:2=awkward,You'll be fine. That bun looks pretty solid.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4=annoyed,What do you mean I can't keep it? Lame.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:1=shy,I hope that's true.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:5=pumped,You betcha!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:navi,targetStage:1=happy,Oh! You're so tiny!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah. Hilarious.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=smug,Got it now? Good.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=calm,Hey, you actually have a mouth! Good for you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:4=beat,(Phew...)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=smug,Try it. I've got hundreds of years of experience on you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:2=thinking,Do you get it <i>now</i>? As in, do you realize what's at stake?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:4=awkward,To be perfectly honest, I like this hairstyle a lot more. More mature.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! There's not very many better feelings than getting to let your feet breathe!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=sad,Aww. That totally ruins the whole joke! Stupid generosity...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=beat,...What? It had to be said, and Neo clearly isn't talking.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=smug,I'm just getting started too. Just you wait!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=pumped,Haha! I love it!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=beat,...Okay. Moving on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=smug,I'd be surprised if you could actually keep up with him.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Only able to stall for so long, I guess.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:3=awkward,That's why I don't bother with neckwear. Can't risk strangulation in close combat!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=pumped,And that's the gauntlet you're about to go through!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:2=stunned,...Oddly specific.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=smug,Sandals are good enough for me, thanks.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ayano,targetStage:1=annoyed,(That's... not exactly a trustworthy smile.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheva,targetStage:2=shy,Can we just burn those boots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're not sanitary.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=calm,Makes sense. Shoes aren't typically part of a sailor suit.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:asuna,targetStage:4=awkward,Oh, it's not magical? Mine... isn't either!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=beat,You and Ryu really are a lot alike.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:3=victory,I can't blame you. I love the wind on my feet, too.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:2,marker:palutenacall=stunned,Oh! Is Riva like those "Sundares" you humans seem to love?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=awkward,That belt seems kind of a pain, if we're being honest.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=awkward,I actually thought those gloves were part of the Zero Suit. Jokes on me, I guess.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=calm,So... yeah. Great choice!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, hey, who needs fashion, am I right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:piper,targetStage:3=shy,Those weren't actually gauntlets though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=beat,...I take it back. I'd prefer them holstered.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=victory,Already halfway done.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=determined,I wouldn't have it any other way.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:misty,targetStage:1=thinking,Pretty? Kinda weird for a tomboy to call herself pretty.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=angry,Look, you're not getting away with whatever you're planning!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=beat,Because it'd be a bit weird to show up in your socks, don't you think?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=pumped,Of course! Playing is my middle name!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yes, we're all massive perverts for seeing your collarbone.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=joking,I'm a little jealous, Nagisa. I wish I had a winter uniform... or even a sweater.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:2=smug,Ah, mismatched socks. Aren't you a rebel?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,Just how cold were you expecting?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=stunned,Uh...right. That's all?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=beat,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=annoyed,I already get that enough from Lady Palutena and the Wii Fit Trainer.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1=awkward,Exactly. Just pick whatever you want.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=thinking,Seriously? I don't think the floor's that bad.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=annoyed,Does your pancreas have six toes, too?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:calisto,targetStage:3=beat,After all, my whole being here was one big joke by Lady Palutena...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:2=calm,(Yeah, pretty sure they're just rings.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kim=awkward,It's also not even clothing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=pumped,You got that right!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,You're accepting it?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=stunned,What?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Guarding the Wish Seed does that, I guess.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:clover,targetStage:3=annoyed,You know what? Fair enough.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Hey, don't be so rude, Revy! Or maybe you could try zipping it for once!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=stunned,I think Aimee's version is cooler.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=sad,Was I staring? Sorry. Let's move on, I guess.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,But Corrin's already in Smash. How can she improve from that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=victory,Yes, continuing seems like the right thing to do.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,Not doing a very good job so far.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:3=beat,Then again, Lady Palutena wears lots of belts for whatever reason.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:harley=beat,Yeah, this is way too confusing...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=sad,I hope Lady Palutena doesn't sneak out like you. I'd never forgive myself if something happened...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=pumped,Guess we need to try even harder!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:2=awkward,Pretty sure threats aren't part of the rules.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,Your sister sounds really cool, Mia! I'd love to meet her.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah. Keep an eye out.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,totalRounds:0=surprised,I guess I can accept that. No one's forcing you to play, after all. At least I hope not...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:futaba,targetStage:2=smug,Thanks for keeping the playing field even.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sonya=beat,So close yet so far.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lara,targetStage:2=thinking,Hmmm? Just hmmm?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:kira=beat,It is really creepy...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,What a boring answer.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:3=shy,Heard that one before?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:1=joking,I dunno, I'd say your whole entourage is pretty trendy!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=awkward,You could totally rock an eyepatch, though.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=happy,It's just one hand, Elaine. Don't jump to conclusions <i>yet.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=thinking,I have no idea what an Oma is.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Hermione's a grown woman. You don't have to apologize to her.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=happy,Wow, you're really breezing right through those clothes, huh? Confident? Or are you still learning the game, maybe?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank goodness. I was worried for a minute.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,(Well, they do call French a language of love...)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=thinking,Do I...?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=smug,Don't assume there <i>won't</i> be a next time.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=stunned,...I guess it was.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:harley,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,Angels... don't bleed, do they Lady Palutena?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ciri,targetStage:1=awkward,Thank goodness. That felt like it went on forever.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:willow,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Lady Palutena, technically. But I get what you're saying.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=pumped,I'm excited to take you on at your full strength!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=awkward,I know how you feel, last thing I want is someone I know finding out I came here.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=beat,From what I hear, Mei is a brilliant scientist! She probably knows all about gadgets.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:2=thinking,Anyone else just see a pop-up window?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=happy,I believe you. I'm just keeping an eye on you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2=thinking,Is something wrong? You're a bit out of it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia=smug,If there's one thing I praise these drinks on, it's their pun game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=smug,Yep. I think she'll be fine.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=annoyed,Don't forget phony.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=annoyed,No need to get so uppity with us.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Ouch. She's got you beat in the snappy boasts, Meia.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Still have no idea why humans like drinking that for fun.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=calm,Too bad your Defense Matrix can't defend against this, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:riva,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:kira=stunned,Gee. I don't know!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jubilee,targetStage:1=thinking,(Maybe she's just a copycat. Like how she's copying stuff Little Mac would do.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=shy,You've done a pretty good job so far.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=annoyed,Now you've encouraged her. Look at what you've done. It's two or none, dang it!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:orendi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:videl=stunned,Huh. You're smarter than you look, you know that?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=happy,Hehe. Only a matter of time now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,Really, how much more can it improve?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=beat,That...doesn't sound all that useful.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=beat,What a weird life you lead.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=happy,When she didn't lose three rounds?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:peach,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice=awkward,Title really doesn't matter in a place like this anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kim=happy,I think you've got a good outfit too, Kim. It's just not very spy-like.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zoey,targetStage:5=happy,Not really. How can I be disappointed in such a good joke?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:jane=surprised,Please don't.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=joking,Guess we should double our efforts.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:leela,targetStage:2=stunned,What does fire have to do with it?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=surprised,Dungeon?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=stunned,Can't we all just get along?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zoey=happy,I can hear Thanatos getting a headache from here.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=awkward,I gotta say: you look much nicer without a pink filter over your face.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=devoted,Thank you. Please, let's move on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=beat,Can't say I blame you for being antsy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,I kind of want to see them too. Can I tag along?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,totalMales:4=surprised,N-No, actually! At least, not like this...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=awkward,I know how you feel. There's a reason I only wear sandals.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=happy,My own dancing could use some work. Mind giving me a few pointers sometime?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:5=smug,Unlike most, I'm actually okay with stalling tactics. It's more time to prepare for the inevitable.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:8=annoyed,*sigh* Forget it. Just deal the next hand.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=stunned,And it's got hammerspace? Hmm. Have you ever heard of the Forces of Nature?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1=thinking,Not quite sure I get what you mean, but whatever.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=happy,Don't stop now!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=calm,I don't need any sort of jacket, so don't worry, I won't touch it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:4=thinking,(I think that's just in the job description for male Pokemon trainers.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:1=annoyed,Are you going to use those as extra layers too?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:2=beat,No worries at all, huh...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=devoted,She finally realized! We have a game!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=victory,But at least it still looked cool!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=joking,I'm not very good with computer stuff, so this is all very interesting to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=angry,I didn't want it anyway! It'd totally clash!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:1=smug,Unless you're me. I always win!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:6=determined,This was a bit of a setback, but you'll still lose in the end!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=beat,Ah well. Better luck next time.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:4=sad,Man, they really tied the whole set together. Now I'm sad.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=awkward,Are capes heavy? I've never worn one myself.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=annoyed,Normal.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hermione,targetStage:4=stunned,Nothing else tipped you off?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shazza,targetStage:3,marker:palutenacall=shy,F-forget you saw that, please.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=smug,Guess we just gotta try harder, then.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ami,targetStage:1=happy,They <i>are</i> pretty cute... even if I don't like socks.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=shy,Sort of...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=calm,You really should get more. Even if it's just a necklace or something.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Really downing those, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:3=thinking,Actually, are those even real drinks? They look kinda pixelly.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Maybe later.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:4=stunned,Mostly?!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tina,targetStage:2=thinking,.....Really.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:1=happy,Will this be an ascent or descent for you, Princess? Only one way to find out!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:1=awkward,That's not what your face says. And you're stuttering.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=stunned,Another drink?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hope,targetStage:2=thinking,A Mimeowhatnow? How close is that to an angel?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=smug,You think <i>that's</i> a real Moonblast? Try having the <i>actual Moon</i> shoot lasers at you... okay, it was a fake Moon, but still.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=beat,I dunno if that's such a good thing. These cards are... sticky.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=beat,Who would be turned on by that? No one here's that depraved... I think.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=awkward,At least you're acting a <i>little</i> more reasonable now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=awkward,Right. Forgot you're just getting started.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:1=devoted,I prefer Lady Palutena's sacred blades anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=joking,I won't, I won't. Don't worry about it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=happy,Oh... your <i>name</i> is Aella! I heard people talking about paella and got really confused.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,I bet you're not used to getting tongue lashings, are you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=shy,I wouldn't want a free eyeful anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=happy,I'll try and keep them in check.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meg,targetStage:1=beat,Not much, really. But it's nice to be done with it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lux,targetStage:1=angry,Maybe you should use your <i>light magic</i> to warm up.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what that is. Is it like a pegasus?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:faye,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe having visible eyes will sink that confidence a bit... or maybe not.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage2=pumped,If this keeps up, your loss will be a <i>shoe-in</i>.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=devoted,Oh good, you're back. I thought you were gone for good.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:2=beat,Is that how that phrase works?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luckycharm=smug,Oh yes. So lucky.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=happy,Don't worry, Elena. I can help make sure no one steals it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=beat,I don't think it'll be that simple. Although I wish it were.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:1=calm,Back to work!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-4=shy,I don't think it'll be that simple... although you're doing pretty good for yourself...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=smug,Okay, now that you've warmed up or whatever, time to make you lose for real!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:3=victory,Still, we're getting there, Evie. Just you wait and see!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:1=happy,I used to have that problem, but since I've grown a lot these past few years, I've learned to ignore it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=joking,No offense, but you're friends are a lot more memorable.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:1=happy,You're right, it's good to see the bright side of things.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:2=beat,Just keep fighting with all you've got, Pit.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:may,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh. Well... I tried.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:3=happy,Oh, ancient symbols? I wonder if those are anything like the Zodiac symbols in my world.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:6=sad,I don't think anyone will go easy on you, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice,targetStage:2=awkward,Yeah, good thing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:5=determined,I'll help keep it safe! If anyone touches it, they have me to answer to!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:tracer,targetStage:5=awkward,I'm kind of relieved. Wouldn't do Tracer justice to go down so easily.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aiyana,targetStage:4=smug,I'm glad there's someone here who appreciates the superior footwear.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zelda,targetStage:2=thinking,Speaking of, does that tiara scratch at all? I've never seen it get scuffed up.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=smug,Ha! Bet it's nothing compared to standing on <i>actual</i> clouds.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:evie,targetStage:1=sad,I'm more annoyed you let the joke hang than that...




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_minor=smug,Ha! Progress!
male_removed_minor=happy,I can go another round. How 'bout you?
female_removing_minor=joking,It's not so bad, ~name~. You could take off way worse.
female_removed_minor=calm,I'm fine with it. Hope the rest of you are, too!

0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
0-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
0-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
0-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
0-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
0-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
0-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
0-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
0-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
0-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
0-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
0-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
0-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
0-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
0-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
0-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
0-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
0-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
0-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
0-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
0-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
0-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
0-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
0-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
0-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
0-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
0-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
0-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
0-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
0-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
0-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
0-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
0-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=thinking,Why do you only wear the one stocking anyway?
0-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
0-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
0-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
0-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
0-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
0-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
0-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
0-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
0-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
0-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
0-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
0-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
0-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
0-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
0-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
0-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
0-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
0-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
0-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
0-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
0-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
0-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
0-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
0-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
0-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
0-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
0-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
0-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
0-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
0-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
0-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
0-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
0-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
0-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
0-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
0-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
0-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
0-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
0-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
0-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
0-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
0-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
0-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
0-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
0-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
0-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
0-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
0-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
0-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
0-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
0-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
0-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
0-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
0-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
0-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
0-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
0-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
0-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
0-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
0-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
0-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
0-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
0-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
0-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
0-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
0-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
0-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
0-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
0-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
0-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
0-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
0-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
0-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
0-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
0-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
0-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=awkward,Standing room only?
0-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
0-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
0-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
0-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
0-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
0-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
0-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
0-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
0-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
0-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
0-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
0-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
0-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
0-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
0-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
0-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
0-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
0-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
0-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
0-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
0-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=devoted,Really? You mean it? Thank you!
0-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
0-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
0-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
0-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
0-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
0-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
0-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
0-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
0-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
0-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
0-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
0-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=pumped,You're right. I should believe in you more. Even so, I won't go easy on you!
0-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
0-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
0-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
0-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
0-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
0-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
0-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
0-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
0-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
0-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
0-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
0-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
0-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
0-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
0-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
0-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
0-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
0-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
0-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
0-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
0-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
0-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
0-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
0-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
0-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
0-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
0-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
0-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
0-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
0-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
0-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
0-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
0-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
0-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
0-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
0-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
0-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
0-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
0-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
0-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
0-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
0-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
0-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
0-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
0-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
0-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
0-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
0-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
0-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
0-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
0-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
0-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
0-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
0-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
0-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
0-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
0-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
0-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
0-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
0-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
0-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
0-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
0-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
0-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
0-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
0-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
0-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
0-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
0-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
0-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
0-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
0-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
0-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.

1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
1-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
1-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
1-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
1-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
1-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
1-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
1-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
1-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
1-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
1-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
1-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
1-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
1-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
1-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
1-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
1-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
1-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
1-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
1-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
1-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
1-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=beat,So just the one stocking. Still don't get it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
1-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
1-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
1-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
1-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
1-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
1-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
1-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
1-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
1-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
1-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
1-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
1-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
1-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
1-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
1-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
1-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
1-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
1-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
1-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
1-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
1-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
1-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
1-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
1-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
1-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
1-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
1-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
1-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
1-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
1-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
1-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
1-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
1-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
1-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
1-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
1-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
1-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
1-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
1-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
1-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
1-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
1-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
1-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
1-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
1-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=beat,It's a bit weird, isn't it? Why aren't there any seats?
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
1-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
1-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
1-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
1-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
1-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
1-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
1-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
1-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
1-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
1-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
1-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
1-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
1-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
1-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
1-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
1-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
1-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
1-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
1-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
1-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
1-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
1-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
1-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
1-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
1-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
1-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
1-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
1-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
1-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
1-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
1-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
1-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
1-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
1-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
1-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
1-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
1-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
1-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
1-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
1-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
1-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
1-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
1-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
1-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
1-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
1-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
1-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
1-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
1-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
1-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
1-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
1-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
1-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
1-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
1-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
1-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
1-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
1-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
1-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
1-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
1-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
1-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
1-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
1-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
1-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
1-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
1-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
1-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
1-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
1-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
1-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
1-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
1-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
1-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
1-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=devoted,Oh, I know you can. Just be careful!
1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
1-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
1-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
1-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=pumped,Oh! Who cares about silly old seats! Bring on the new sandals!
1-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
1-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
1-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
1-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
1-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
1-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
1-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
1-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
1-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
1-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
1-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
1-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
1-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
1-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
1-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
1-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
1-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
1-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!

2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
2-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
2-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
2-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
2-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
2-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
2-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
2-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
2-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
2-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
2-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
2-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
2-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
2-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
2-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
2-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
2-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
2-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
2-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
2-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
2-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
2-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
2-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
2-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
2-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
2-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
2-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
2-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
2-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
2-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
2-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
2-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
2-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
2-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
2-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
2-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
2-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
2-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
2-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
2-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
2-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
2-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
2-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
2-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
2-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
2-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
2-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
2-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
2-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
2-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
2-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
2-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
2-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
2-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
2-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
2-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
2-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
2-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
2-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
2-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
2-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
2-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
2-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
2-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
2-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
2-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
2-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=happy,I still say you should start wearing two stockings.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
2-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
2-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
2-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
2-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
2-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
2-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
2-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
2-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
2-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
2-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
2-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
2-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
2-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
2-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
2-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
2-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
2-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
2-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
2-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
2-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
2-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
2-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
2-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=happy,It was nice to get my belt off.
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=devoted,I don't doubt you can, Lady Palutena!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
2-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
2-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
2-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
2-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
2-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
2-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=devoted,Really? Thank you!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
2-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
2-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
2-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
2-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
2-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
2-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
2-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
2-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
2-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
2-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
2-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
2-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
2-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
2-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
2-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
2-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
2-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
2-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
2-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
2-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
2-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
2-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
2-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
2-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
2-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
2-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
2-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
2-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
2-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
2-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
2-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
2-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
2-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
2-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
2-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
2-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
2-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
2-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
2-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
2-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
2-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
2-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
2-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
2-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
2-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
2-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
2-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
2-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
2-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
2-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
2-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
2-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
2-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
2-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
2-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?


#lost sandals
3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
3-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
3-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
3-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
3-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
3-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
3-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
3-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
3-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
3-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
3-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
3-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
3-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
3-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
3-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
3-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
3-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=annoyed,You're both wusses. This floor isn't cold!
3-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
3-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
3-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
3-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
3-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
3-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
3-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
3-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
3-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
3-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
3-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
3-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
3-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
3-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
3-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
3-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
3-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
3-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
3-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
3-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
3-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
3-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
3-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
3-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
3-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
3-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
3-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
3-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
3-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
3-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
3-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
3-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
3-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't think this is that bad of a loss for you. You already only wear one!
3-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
3-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
3-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
3-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
3-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
3-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
3-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
3-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
3-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=beat,I could use a seat. I don't really want to stand here barefoot.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
3-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
3-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
3-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
3-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
3-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
3-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
3-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
3-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
3-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
3-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
3-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
3-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
3-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
3-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
3-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
3-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
3-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
3-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
3-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
3-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
3-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
3-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
3-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
3-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
3-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
3-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
3-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
3-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
3-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
3-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
3-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
3-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
3-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
3-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
3-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
3-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
3-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
3-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
3-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
3-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
3-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
3-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
3-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
3-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
3-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
3-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
3-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
3-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
3-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
3-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
3-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
3-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
3-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
3-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
3-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
3-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
3-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
3-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
3-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
3-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
3-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
3-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
3-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
3-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
3-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
3-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
3-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
3-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
3-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
3-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
3-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
3-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
3-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
3-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
3-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
3-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
3-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
3-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
3-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
3-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
3-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
3-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
3-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
3-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
3-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
3-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
3-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
3-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
3-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
3-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
3-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
3-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
3-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
3-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
3-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
3-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
3-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
3-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
3-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
3-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
3-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
3-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
3-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
3-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
3-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
3-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
3-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
3-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
3-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
3-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
3-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
3-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
3-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
3-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
3-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
3-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=shy,You're right. You've come back from worse...
3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=devoted,Sweet! In that case, just go ahead and keep those old ones.
3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=shy,Yeah. So I've noticed.
3-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
3-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
3-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.


#lost tunic
4-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
4-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
4-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
4-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
4-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
4-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
4-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
4-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
4-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
4-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
4-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
4-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
4-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
4-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
4-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
4-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
4-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
4-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
4-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
4-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
4-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
4-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
4-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
4-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
4-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
4-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
4-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
4-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
4-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
4-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
4-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
4-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
4-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
4-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
4-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
4-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
4-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
4-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
4-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=annoyed,You're both wusses. This floor isn't cold!
4-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
4-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
4-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
4-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
4-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
4-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
4-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
4-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
4-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
4-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
4-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
4-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
4-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
4-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
4-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
4-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
4-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
4-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
4-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
4-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
4-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
4-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
4-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
4-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
4-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
4-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
4-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
4-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
4-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
4-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
4-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
4-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
4-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
4-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
4-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
4-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
4-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
4-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
4-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
4-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
4-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
4-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
4-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
4-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
4-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
4-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
4-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
4-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
4-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
4-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
4-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
4-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
4-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
4-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
4-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
4-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
4-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
4-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
4-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
4-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
4-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
4-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
4-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
4-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
4-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
4-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
4-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
4-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
4-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
4-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
4-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
4-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
4-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
4-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
4-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
4-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
4-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
4-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
4-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
4-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
4-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
4-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
4-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
4-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
4-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
4-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
4-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
4-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
4-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
4-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
4-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
4-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
4-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
4-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
4-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
4-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
4-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
4-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
4-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
4-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
4-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
4-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
4-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
4-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
4-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
4-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
4-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
4-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
4-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
4-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
4-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
4-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=shy,You probably should've worn more than just the one.
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=awkward,I think you have to bring your own seats. Which is kind of silly.
4-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
4-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
4-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
4-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
4-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
4-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
4-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
4-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
4-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
4-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
4-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
4-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
4-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
4-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
4-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
4-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
4-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
4-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
4-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
4-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
4-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
4-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
4-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
4-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
4-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
4-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
4-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
4-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
4-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
4-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
4-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
4-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
4-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
4-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
4-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
4-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
4-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
4-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
4-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
4-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
4-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
4-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
4-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
4-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
4-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
4-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
4-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
4-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
4-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
4-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
4-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=awkward,I have the utmost faith in you! ...Even if it's at my own expense.
4-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
4-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
4-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
4-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
4-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
4-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
4-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
4-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
4-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
4-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
4-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
4-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
4-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
4-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
4-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
4-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
4-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
4-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=shy,Yeah. So I've noticed.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
4-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
4-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
4-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
4-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
4-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
4-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
4-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
4-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
4-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
4-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
4-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
4-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=happy,Nice! New kicks!
4-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
4-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
4-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
4-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
4-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
4-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
4-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
4-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
4-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
4-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
4-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
4-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
4-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
4-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
4-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
4-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
4-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
4-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
4-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
4-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
4-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
4-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
4-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
4-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
4-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
4-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
4-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
4-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
4-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
4-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
4-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
4-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
4-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
4-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
4-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
4-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
4-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?

-3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
-3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
-3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
-3-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
-3-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
-3-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
-3-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
-3-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
-3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
-3-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
-3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
-3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
-3-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
-3-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
-3-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
-3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=annoyed,You're both wusses. This floor isn't cold!
-3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
-3-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
-3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
-3-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=shy,You're about to lose your last line of defense. Did you really have to only wear the one?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=shy,I wish there were seats... if only to cover myself better.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
-3-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=devoted,I'll take that. I needed some good news. Thank you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=pumped,Yeah! If I'm still alive, I'm sure you can come back!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=shy,Yeah. So I've noticed.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
-3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
-3-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!

-2-male_removing_minor=calm,Thank you for stalling on my behalf.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
-2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
-2-male_removed_minor=annoyed,I would've preferred you lost that <i>before</i> I was eliminated, but...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=annoyed,You're both wusses. This floor isn't cold!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
-2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
-2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
-2-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
-2-female_removing_minor=shy,So you still had that...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=beat,There's a reason I'm kneeling, you know.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=shy,Why'd it have to just be the one? And why did you have to be so liberal?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
-2-female_removed_minor=sad,I can't say I'm surprised, but just your ~clothing~? That doesn't really help me...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
-2-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
-2-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=shy,Yeah. So I've noticed.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=devoted,R-Right. I <i>should</i> believe in you more.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=sad,No fair! I wanted to be the one to take her down.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
-2-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ... is what I would say, if I wasn't out.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm glad I'm getting some sort of reward for doing this.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.

-1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=surprised,See, that's the type of big I was expecting.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:5=surprised,(I think he's breaking a little.)
-1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=beat,True. Shame we have to stand, though.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:fred,targetStage:1=awkward,Who knows? I wasn't paying attention.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=beat,So much for being macho and stuff.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:1=angry,Well?
-1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0-10,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=awkward,I mean, I can see it.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:1=calm,The other easy choice.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:kira,targetStage:3=thinking,Kinda difficult to do that in such a dirty game.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Come on, Corrin. Everyone's <i>l-egging</i> you on!
-1-male_removing_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:2=thinking,(Humans are really sensitive to the cold, huh? It worked out for Caleb, though.)
-1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=awkward,I'm surprised you don't want to hide your secret identity.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=angry,Oh no. You're not dragging this out with something like that!
-1-male_removing_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=joking,Good, I'm not the only one.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=awkward,Nah, I love learning new stuff. Ask me anything about video games!
-1-male_removing_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=smug,Getting nervous yet?
-1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:2=happy,Boom! There goes the holster!
-1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,Plus it'd get confusing with two Oracles here.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=smug,It's fine! Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps!
-1-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=happy,Good choice. Er, choices.
-1-male_removing_minor,target:xander,targetStage:0=annoyed,Wow. So big.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:6=beat,Not quite. Although I wish you were.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=annoyed,You're both wusses. This floor isn't cold!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:4=calm,Yes. Seriously, that's all there is to say. Yes.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:2=sad,Ugh...don't even mention that...
-1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,What oath are you keeping, exactly?
-1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:3=joking,You're much braver than I am. I always rely on my weapons.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=beat,Nice to meet a fellow food lover. Even if it is...you know.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:3=happy,Good. It's a silly hat anyway.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:caleb,targetStage:3=determined,Stay positive! It's not over until it's over!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=beat,Better to realize that now, I guess.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:link,targetStage:2=beat,Oh. Your boots. Carry on.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=stunned,You got to design it? That's pretty cool, actually.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=awkward,Shame I can't use Lady Palutena's powers in here. I'd totally give you an Explosive Flame if you wanted it!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:3=smug,You know how you can be manly? Fight with all your power! Like Mario or Mega Man would!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=beat,Hmm. Normally that gets them.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:fred,targetStage:2=thinking,I feel no different. Was something supposed to happen there?
-1-male_removed_minor,target:kira,targetStage:4=surprised,(Suddenly I'm glad I don't wear socks.)
-1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=thinking,That sounds like something you should complain to the higher-ups about.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:2=angry,Bit presumptuous, aren't you? In case you haven't noticed, <i>I'm a dude</i>!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stunned,Really? Guess it is.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=victory,Good stuff, 9s. You're not half bad.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:xander,targetStage:1=awkward,I'd rather feast my mouth right now.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hope,targetStage:2=calm,I see you take care of your socks. Maybe even moreso than I do with my clothes...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3=shy,Feeling nervous, Pyrrha? T-Take as much time as you need.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee=surprised,A bee?! Where? Don't let it get near me!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:3=thinking,...Why wouldn't they?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=surprised,You're pulling our legs, right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:1=happy,Virtual arm accessories? I bet they don't weigh a thing!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=stunned,...Standard choice.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:1=thinking,Depends on whether you want to choose something else or not. Your call.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:2=shy,Even that armor is suggestive...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:evie,targetStage:1,marker:puns=joking,Hey, no problem. You don't need 'em anymore, so we're giving them the <i>boot</i>.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,marker:freudianslip=embarrassed,Oh, just your jacking it. I mean jacket! Jacket!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=annoyed,You get to sit down in midair? Lucky.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:2=beat,You look <i>way</i> too impressed, ~player~.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=thinking,I feel like we've been through this song and dance already.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=stunned,Well, this is going to be interesting.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:1=surprised,You're kind of showing... you know...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:2=shy,Uh... m-maybe?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:2=smug,I don't think it's that hard. Just use sandals!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=awkward,I'd say it worked out in your favor.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=beat,This was seriously not what I was expecting when I came here tonight.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:2=awkward,You must not go barefoot often. You should try it sometime.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:4=awkward,Never been a fan of socks, personally.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:videl,targetStage:2=calm,Not a sock fan either? I can respect that.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=embarrassed,(Don't look up her skirt, don't look up her skirt...)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:smallcount=awkward,Small <i>is</i> the way to go.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=shy,So it seems.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=smug,Who uses bibs these days?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette=calm,Well, I'm not disappointed. Go on...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=happy,So if you're a superhero, that means that that's like a utility belt, right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,(I didn't come here to watch two girls treat me like white noise.)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=sad,What a heartwrennching parting.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,Such a straight answer, wow...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:2=happy,Finally, someone else who wears a sash!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0=joking,Prancing Boots? Sounds more fitting for a horse than you, Asuna.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=smug,What, you want a standing ovation?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=happy,Nothing wrong with unexciting.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=happy,That's Inkling talk, alright!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:2=beat,Boots? Okay, okay.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:1=beat,Well, it's not really covering skin, but a win is a win.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:teleport=awkward,If you were serious about teleporting... take me with you! Please?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:0=beat,Guess you don't really need it. Maybe the Inventory should install a sunroof or something.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=awkward,I wasn't going to <i>say</i> it, but, since you brought it up...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,Well, socks to be you right now.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:2loss=shy,I didn't sign up for this either. I got dragged here by Lady Palutena.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=happy,You'll be fine, Florina! I believe in you!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:sorg=awkward,In all fairness, losing your gloves first would get us the same results in the end.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:0=calm,Not a bad start.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,totalMales:4=surprised,Ouch. I'm sorry if you feel attacked. Would it make you feel better if I said I'm treating everyone here as a rival, not just you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:paya,targetStage:2=calm,You haven't even gotten <i>too</i> far in yet.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:1=smug,Still nothing to it!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:piper,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hmm. I wonder if there are any kleptos here.)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=happy,I think I can handle it.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=thinking,You'd think someone who's allergic to shoes wouldn't wear gloves either.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:velma=happy,Okay, that's a little better.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=happy,Ooh! Can I try it on? That hoodie is pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=awkward,You still have a whole dress. Losing a silly little jacket shouldn't be so bad.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=awkward,Yeah, I doubt it.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=happy,Anyone up for chicken? Moon's hat gave me a craving for it.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=beat,Well, obvious is subjective...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=joking,What a <i>stock</i> choice, Faye.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=annoyed,Yeah, kind of. I don't <i>hate</i> it, at least.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:3=calm,Come, on, B.C.! No need to be so bummed about it.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=stunned,Ah, your top. Nothing wrong with that.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:3=loss,(She definitely <i>sounds</i> annoyed...)
-1-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=awkward,I wouldn't put too much <i>stock</i> into those. Heh heh...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:3=stunned,You made those? ...Did you make the armor too?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=sad,A moment of silence for Orendi's witch hat.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=happy,I barely know anything about armor. Is your variant any different from human armor?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=awkward,I'm just gonna keep it simple and call it the next item.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,marker:puns=joking,I won't run away with them, if that's what you're implying.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=beat,Just gloves. Nothing too extreme, Nugi-chan.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mei,targetStage:2=thinking,Is that jacket puffy or fluffy? I hear there's a difference.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=thinking,You sound glum about it. It's just stockings.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=joking,You're really <i>blazing</i> through these items, huh?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=smug,Feeling a bit shorter, Ms. Valentine?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:amy_rose=thinking,Any reason you prefer one over the other?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:1=smug,Whoa there! Don't strain yourself with such a heavy-weight item.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=smug,We just won us some <i>boot</i>-y.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>That</i> is a cloak at best.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=joking,I didn't catch that, mind repeating it?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=beat,Again, do you really have to narrate everything?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=smug,The classic pirate coat! Exactly what I was hoping for!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, so that's where it was.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:2=pumped,Yeah, bare those feet! Disappoint this "chat" of yours.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=beat,I don't get why you sacrificed the gown before them, but whatever.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:5=annoyed,What are you doing now?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2=pumped,Alright! An easy choice.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ann=beat,Yeah, you'd think it'd be no big deal to take off a jacket. I blame the peanut gallery.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:2=thinking,Are you supposed to do that? I've just gotten used to the cold.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:tina,targetStage:5=shy,Please do it quickly. Don't drag this on any longer than neccessary.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=annoyed,Just call it a drape like a normal person. Maybe undress like one, too.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=calm,Yep. Boots are never a big deal.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=thinking,Sometimes I question why you wore only one stocking to a game like this.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=shy,Kneeling worked out okay for me, I think.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=stunned,...That's not what's happening?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=beat,Still not a huge loss, though...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=happy,So do you know ~player~, Monika? You can hardly tear your eyes away...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So why are you making her take off your boots for you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh, a bona-fide breastplate!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:peach,targetStage:2=thinking,They just slip off? Maybe you should get a smaller size.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elaine=joking,Like night and day, these two.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:1=beat,More than the bracelets, actually.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:gogo=surprised,That sounds graphic. I really hope I never stumble across it.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=smug,Win? No win.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=surprised,<i>Maybe</i> I can understand trying that with the cowboy outfit, but this is suicidal!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=happy,Thank you, Miss Obvious.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=beat,We can wait... even if that's not my strong suit.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:10=shy,I appreciate what you're doing for your friend...but, uh, maybe don't grab her like that?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,That look of defeat fits you like a glove!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=smug,Of course she knows that! I'm the best ranger she's got, after all!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:2=smug,I'd have thought you would've <i>wanted</i> to flash them.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. Those boots are pretty modern, like the rest of your getup.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:faye,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,You're looking at Faye pretty harshly there...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:3=awkward,Ah yes. Those gloves leave a pretty decent mark.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=stunned,Wait, is she right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=thinking,Maybe a little off topic, but I'm curious in how that weapon works.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=surprised,Oh, Kyoko... I had no idea.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=awkward,You'd be as good as dead if you just float in space. You need something to travel with!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=beat,Well, considering she lost and all...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:yang,targetStage:4,marker:puns=smug,Ahem... <i>by the power</i> vested <i>in me</i>...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=shy,Why? Should I be?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=smug,I always wondered if a super suit would work well for me. Do you think it would suit me, Lady Palutena?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,Nugs? Like chicken nugs?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=thinking,Hector's your friend, right? I bet he'd be thrilld you're stepping outside your comfort zone.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4=victory,And off <i>they</i> go...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=awkward,Thanks for stopping her, Lyn.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=pumped,Of course it's fair! Why wouldn't it be?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=joking,Slow down! Such a big choice is making me <i>jumpy</i>!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=happy,I see nothing wrong with those.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:4=smug,There's nothing more reliable than a good pair of footwear.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chell,targetStage:0=thinking,If I remember right, those boots protect humans from a long fall, right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:chara,targetStage:2=smug,Yes, what a scandal.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:2=loss,Resisting urge... to make the joke...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:2=joking,Could you maybe try removing them <i>normally</i>?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=smug,Is that wordplay I hear?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=awkward,Glad to meet someone else with that sort of naming scheme.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=awkward,Gotta say, loving this much more than the alternative.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=beat,That hoodie looked pretty neat. Sorry about that.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:1=pumped,Socks are A-OK by me!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=beat,How many do you think are here right now?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Boots first!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=thinking,Kind of? By the end of today, it's gonna be like a sauna.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=joking,Are you getting in-vest-ed in this yet?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=thinking,Did you not think this far ahead?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=happy,Finally! I've been waiting for this!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:1=beat,Is this what passes for lewd in the apocalypse? That's depressing.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=awkward,Guess not. Pretty warm in here, wouldn't you say?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=smug,Well, ~player~? Are you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:2=thinking,What <i>did</i> you expect from a floor?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:1=beat,Do you want me to leave? I don't want to be a bother, and you look like you'll break into tears any minute...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Even if I find myself facing pirates from time to time, their songs are great.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:2=smug,Will this be your last loss? Probably not.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:leela,targetStage:2=shy,Cheap? ...Where did you get those?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=joking,I see you've already <i>braced</i> yourself for this loss.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:1=shy,Wow, that's actually really generous.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Streaming-chan won't have to watch her back. She has hundreds of viewers to do that for her.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chara=pumped,Good luck with that. Chara's attacks are easy to dodge, at least.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=happy,Hey thanks!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=sad,Oh. Okay...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:1=thinking,You're supposed to match scarves with everything else?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,You already have guns that heal all wounds. What else is there to learn?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:captain_america=calm,Hmm. These two...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy=beat,I hate that I understand what you mean.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=stunned,Ooh, you're using magic to strip? That's awesome!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=pumped,<i>Roight! Let's do this!</i>
-1-female_removing_minor,target:launch,targetStage:4=surprised,Are the shoes that important to you? Sorry...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:rinkah=sad,I hope I'm the type to stand out. I don't want to fade into obscurity for another 25 years...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:2=calm,Yep.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:willow,targetStage:1=beat,Sorry, didn't quite catch that.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Pretty sure taking off thighhighs gracefully is impossible unless you're Lady Palutena.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:2=beat,I'm not the jacket-type, but even I have to admit that that's a pretty nice jacket.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=joking,Please aim in a non-lethal fashion.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=stunned,Blue hair just happens, Sei. It's not just some badge!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,She does <i>not</i> speak for me! Bu to be honest, I don't know how I would feel about it.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:0=beat,Jacket, huh? I can't really relate. I'm used to cold temperatures.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pauling=happy,You'd know a thing or two about hats, right Ms. Pauling? Maybe console her or something.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=beat,You say that a lot, don't you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sei,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,I'm glad you're giving her motivation, but...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=shy,It's just a jacket... right?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=thinking,I always wondered how practical a super suit would be. Maybe I should try one on sometime.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lara,targetStage:0=awkward,I suppose it is.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=shy,Chief.... Navidad?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:clover,targetStage:0=happy,Yeah, that's about all I expected.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=beat,Lady Palutena always tells me to chew my food before talking. Try it sometime.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ann=stunned,I never thought of it like that, but I think you're right!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I think I'll stop bothering. I can't win with this woman.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=happy,Right. Friendly. So get along, ladies.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=awkward,I think so. With a face like that? C'mon, who wouldn't?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=angry,I don't want them! What would I do with socks?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=pumped,Good! I don't want to just walk all over you guys!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:amy_rose=annoyed,I wouldn't mind owning silk gloves myself, but Lady Palutena says they "aren't practical".
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=beat,Seems almost a little condescending when you put it like that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=devoted,Such a pure friendship... I hope one day Lady Palutena and I have a friendship like that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=pumped,Right! I don't just <i>let</i> anyone win, either!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:velma=joking,Not everything needs to be a vital piece, and I'm okay with that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=smug,Maybe you should let me use that dumb hat for a round. See how you like it when the tables are turned.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:6=smug,Uh-huh.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,alsoPlayingStage:0=angry,Of course he's you! What, have you never seen a clone before?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=surprised,I'm not going to stop you, but can you wait until after this game is finished?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5=beat,I'm surprised you're losing this much. You're giving the gods a bad name!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=embarrassed,She was totally right.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ann=sad,I wish the game was that simple.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=calm,Exactly. You really need to play better. Or at least lay off the drinks.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=shy,(Her optimism is infectious, I swear...)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=shy,Yeah. So I've noticed.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:3=happy,Sporty? I'd call that more casual, hang-out wear, but you do you.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:tina,targetStage:6=angry,That's disgusting!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2=joking,I hope that somewhere isn't here. I wouldn't put it past you all, though.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:yang,targetStage:5=shy,I declare that things are really warming up!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=sad,No fair! I wanted to be the one to take her down.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3=awkward,So yeah. There you go.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:tifa,targetStage:2=happy,What can I say? I'm used to going for the materia.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=awkward,Thank you, Lady Palutena. At least I get a consolation prize.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=awkward,Well, you don't have me to worry about, that's for sure.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:videl,targetStage:3=pumped,Let's go at full force! Palutena's mightiest warrior versus the daughter of the world champ... is what I would say, if I hadn't already lost. Oh well. Maybe we can spar later?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=shy,...It's okay to laugh, you know.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:3=shy,How many legs is that? You know, just in case someone here doesn't know.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:willow,targetStage:2=stunned,Oh, that's what you meant! I was confused for a little bit there.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:nagisa_little_sister=happy,I sure hope you can be friends. It'd be good. For all of us.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=awkward,Must be pretty good friends.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=shy,What Sei said.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,This is your only warning. Don't.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=joking,And yet you're still covered from head to toe.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human=calm,Just a little bit of spice.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human=smug,Don't get too wild there.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:human=devoted,Finally getting somewhere. Not far, but somewhere.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=pumped,Oh, a flexing contest, is it? Lucky for you, I got you all tickets to the gun show!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:3=happy,Maybe you can visit Skyworld sometime. You can see the classic divine wear.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lemmy=shy,That doesn't really sound like role reversal.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:april,targetStage:2=joking,No one's above stupid jokes. Just ask me!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ayano,targetStage:4=beat,Who is <i>he</i>? It's not me, is it?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=stunned,Are those dyed hair tips? It's like a reverse Phosphora!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=annoyed,And now I can't stop thinking about virtual arm accessories.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:3=awkward,Come on, it's not that bad. Calling it carrion is uncalled for.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:2=shy,Might want to stand up slowly there.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=stunned,Really? That's awesome! No one's ever wanted to cosplay me before...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=stunned,I mean, not even the Flintlock Staff is that accurate! I'd love to try it out!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ami,targetStage:3=thinking,Never really tried matching blue with white. Do you think it'd look good on me?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah... just a... just a jacket.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:3=stunned,Well, I can give you some good potential uses for it, if you want.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chell,targetStage:1=joking,...Silent type, huh? That's fine.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:leela,targetStage:3=stunned,How does that even happen? Seriously?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=calm,Don't worry, I'm no thief. You're not either, right ~player~?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:1=annoyed,Sidequests, huh? Is that anything like the Treasure Hunt?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:4,marker:puns=joking,How, er, <i>tight</i>!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:angie,targetStage:2=sad,You're still grumpy?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. Guess you're a better shot than I gave you credit for.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=annoyed,But seriously, did you not think to bring anything else?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:launch,targetStage:5=beat,I see. Let's just move on from Launch's feet and play the next hand, shall we?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=awkward,Your kicks shouldn't be nearly as bad now! Er, not that I was <i>expecting</i> you to kick anyone, but... never mind.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pauling,targetStage:3=awkward,(At least she had pantyhose.)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4=surprised,How many weapons do you have on you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:paya,targetStage:3=joking,Keep trying and it'll all work out. I think.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:peach,targetStage:3=awkward,Should've brought a Fire Flower.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,They're pretty good replicas.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3=sad,*shudders*
-1-female_removed_minor,target:piper,targetStage:4=joking,I know! The thought makes me shudder, too.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:3,marker:puns=calm,Gotta <i>hand</i> it to ya; you're putting up a good resistance.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:1=stunned,Oh, right. We were playing cards. I'm sure you'll do better next time.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:2=stunned,...Are you serious?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=annoyed,...No need to be sassy about it...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=devoted,There you go. Look on the bright side, Mahiru.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:rosalina,targetStage:4=surprised,Annnd now you feel even more bare than before. Funny how that works.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3=surprised,What are you implying?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=shy,(You're not the only one getting hotter.)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=beat,Too stuffy for my taste.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chara,targetStage:3=pumped,Good! We'll be going all out, too!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:2=surprised,Somehow, the fact you brought a gun doesn't surprise me...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:3=thinking,Come to think of it, the Valentine in your name is pretty fitting, huh?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:faye,targetStage:4=pumped,That sounds like a challenge. Why don't you take her on, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2=pumped,Okay, sure. Deal me in!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=thinking,Do human moms make their kids layer up? Huh. Totally the opposite of Skyworld.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kurumu,targetStage:3=beat,I hope that's the case.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=pumped,I'll hold you to that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,No, it's fine. I wish I could help but that's more Lady Palutena's field of expertise.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I'm glad you all aren't <i>that</i> weird.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=annoyed,We should file a complaint. Our developers are getting lazy on us!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, you're still decent. Count your blessings, Blake.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lara,targetStage:1=beat,Never thought <i>you</i> would say that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:evie,targetStage:2,marker:puns=pumped,Hey, nice laugh. It sure puts a <i>chill down my spine</i>!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:6=awkward,Oh, you aren't going to pull another item out of nowhere? That honesty is pretty refreshing.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=pumped,On the contrary, I'm liking this omen. Please keep it up!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, pistols are still pretty pirate-y.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:2=surprised,What a gruesome-sounding order.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:3=pumped,Maybe you should invest in stat-boosting weapons. Then you won't have to worry about your clothes!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=smug,We'll see about that, now won't we?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalFemales:2=embarrassed,Y-you want me to do <i>what</i>?! I haven't even gotten to know Futaba! I can't do... that!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:1=pumped,Y-yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Carpe diem and all that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:3=annoyed,Goo-good moment. Real sentimental, guys.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=pumped,Wow, I don't even get deals this good at the supermarket!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=awkward,A bit weird. But let's move on.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2=joking,Maybe you should just stay quiet for a while.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:3=happy,So what's your opinion of puns, Florina? Stop me if you've heard this one before...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:calisto,targetStage:2=joking,I wonder if there are any attorneys who do their job barefoot. Not likely, but it's fun to think about.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=stunned,...Oh. Okay then.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=beat,I wear a tunic too... but you knew that already.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Let's have ourselves a nice, fun game!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4=smug,You should've known better then.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:3=annoyed,What do you want from me? I have a well-tuned moral compass.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=smug,Woohoo.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. It's like a loading screen for undressing.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,Yeah, I love taking my sandals off at the end of the day.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2=thinking,I have no idea what those are.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:buffy,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I thought I was the weird one.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:3=beat,Maybe, but it did look pretty comfortable on its own.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hope,targetStage:3=pumped,Nice! Then let's go, everyone!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=joking,I haven't met many humans to begin with, so I'm pretty sure I'd remember you.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:5=beat,And what a mess this is...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=smug,If you and ~player~ are so fed up with the small stuff, just go get a room. I won't stop you.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:orendi,targetStage:2=joking,Oh. Never miss a beat, do you Orendi?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:4=beat,Right, right.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=beat,I'll keep my distance.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=annoyed,How could anyone call those 'cute'?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=devoted,Pretty good magic. N-Not that I doubted your skills, what with your name and all...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-ruby_v4:1=happy,I think kneesocks would suit you better.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=sad,(I should probably apologize again after the game. Otherwise Lady Palutena will kill me.)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3,totalExposed:1-4=shy,That's putting it <i>way</i> too mildly!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,totalExposed:1-3=shy,Y-Yeah. Unfortunately...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=thinking,(This girl's more bubbly than me on my best days... it's actually a little scary.)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pauldrons=smug,Who needs pauldrons anyway? Monsters only ever aim for the head!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dna_lock=awkward,Remind me to never try on that armor.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:comfygloves=devoted,They do seem comfy...might have to try them on some time.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:arwen=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=sad,It's gone...let's hope it doesn't come back.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:footfet=awkward,Don't worry, I'm not here to shame you. It'd be pretty hypo... hippo... two-faced of me.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=awkward,And the world is better off for it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2loss=determined,But even if I don't like it, I'm still here! So... don't leave just yet, okay?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip1=calm,Yeah, I rarely get new gear. Usually only if they're tattered, at that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=sad,(As if this couldn't get any more embarrassing...)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:daphne,targetStage:2=awkward,Fashion is too complicated for me. That's why my look hasn't changed in 33 years!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:damage_reduction=stunned,If it's lightweight, I might look into getting one of those.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=devoted,Oh, good. And for the record, I totally wasn't worried at all!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=shy,Riiiight. (Sheesh, she really can't make small talk, huh?)
-1-female_removed_minor,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=joking,I know you're the Scarlet Witch and all, but those boots were too flashy even for me.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=smug,You're pretty tough! Let's keep on going!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:link=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zelda=thinking,I have no idea what those are, but there <i>is</i> an elf in this house...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Something tells me Chun-Li doesn't see it as a pleasure.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:mettaton=sad,Never in my life did I think I'd hate being in a room full of robots.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:uhura,targetStage:4=smug,How long, though?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=devoted,Aw man, now I want some virtual arm accessories. When are we going digital, Lady Palutena?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Hey! I'm the Angel here! Lady Palutena is far above that title!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=joking,Calm down! You'll never win if you get distracted.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,I like my stuff too. What a coincidence!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=happy,Then I guess we're good. For now.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=annoyed,Aw, a two-parter? Lame. No one likes a "to be continued".
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:gogo=embarrassed,O-Oh...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,Why does it not surprise me you're good at this game?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:yang=stunned,Is she actually going to hoot at you over shoulders? I mean, those are pretty nice, but, I mean, really?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6=pumped,Now it's a fight! Let's go!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sonya,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:revy=pumped,Fight! Fight! Fight!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,At this rate, you won't last until morning.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=beat,Not sure that's a good idea. One tipsy woman is pushing it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1-5,alsoPlaying:kyoko=angry,Don't let her get to you, Kyoko. You can take off your gloves when you're ready.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=surprised,This is already getting weird...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione=calm,Nice and peaceful. I like it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,You don't have to be so serious here, you know.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=surprised,Now I want to know too. How <i>do</i> you know that?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mara_jade,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=beat,I'm surrounded by gun nuts.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:dawn,targetStage:3=awkward,In your case, sure. I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:daisy,targetStage:3=smug,Oh yes, whatever will you do.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:2=awkward,No, but you're pretty infamous. You're not even from a game and I know you.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pyrrha,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:2strip2=happy,You're missing out! Sure, you lose a couple inches, but you feel so much more agile!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:3=smug,Ah, so you do have feet. Interesting.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mercy,targetStage:4=smug,Yes, we can all see how healthy you are.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=beat,So I guess the stalling's over... wonderful.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=devoted,You know, it's not often I refer to someone besides Lady Palutena with an honorific. Feels funny.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:2=devoted,Well, let's hope your luck turns around!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=joking,Right? Like I said earlier, it's nice.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:4=awkward,It's like you're wearing a bodysuit now!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:marceline,targetStage:3=awkward,Sure, technically.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=happy,Good to hear!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,targetStage:1=pumped,Oh, nice! Bonus!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=surprised,You're not mocking me, a-are you?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Keep going!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:2=happy,Maybe you should get a better set, and convert these ones to hearts.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=happy,I was a fan of the clashing colors, though. I'll miss it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:3=thinking,I'm starting to think you actually <i>want</i> us to be.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mei,targetStage:3=awkward,Coats are overrated anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lux,targetStage:3=joking,I like to think I'm nice to talk to.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sharla,targetStage:3=determined,Right. Just win another hand.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=pumped,Good. You'll be more limber when you have to do the forfeit!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=joking,But you're not barefoot yet!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:ciri,targetStage:4=victory,Even if I have no need for armor, I can respect a good set of it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=smug,<i>Now</i> you should stay on your toes.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=stunned,Wow, you almost look like a human without your armor.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sheva,targetStage:1=stunned,They're just hands. If they were cool robot hands, maybe I'd enjoy them
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meg,targetStage:2=awkward,Nope. But my jokes are all uncontrollably corny!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=beat,I should've know better than to have taken a compliment from you.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
male_removing_major=pumped,Yeah-hah! Finally, a decisive win!
male_removed_major=victory,One step closer to victory!
female_removing_major=shy,Looks like you're gonna lose your ~clothing~. Hope you don't mind.
female_removed_major=surprised,You've got a nice body. Sorry, did I step out of line?


#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
0-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
0-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
0-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
0-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
0-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
0-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
0-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
0-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
0-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
0-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
0-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
0-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
0-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
0-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
0-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
0-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
0-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
0-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
0-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
0-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
0-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
0-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
0-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
0-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
0-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
0-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
0-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
0-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
0-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
0-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
0-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
0-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
0-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
0-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
0-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
0-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
0-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
0-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
0-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
0-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
0-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
0-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
0-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
0-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
0-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
0-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
0-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
0-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
0-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
0-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
0-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
0-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
0-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
0-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
0-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
0-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
0-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
0-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
0-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
0-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
0-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
0-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
0-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
0-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
0-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
0-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
0-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
0-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
0-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
0-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
0-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
0-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
0-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
0-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
0-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
0-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
0-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
0-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
0-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
0-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
0-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
0-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
0-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
0-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
0-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
0-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
0-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
0-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
0-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
0-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
0-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
0-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
0-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
0-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
0-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
0-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
0-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
0-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
0-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
0-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
0-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
0-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
0-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
0-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
0-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
0-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
0-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
0-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
0-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
0-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
0-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
0-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
0-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
0-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
0-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
0-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
0-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
0-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
0-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
0-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
0-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
0-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
0-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
0-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
0-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...
0-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
0-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
0-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
0-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
0-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
0-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
0-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
0-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
0-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
0-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
0-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
0-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
0-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
0-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
0-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
0-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
0-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
0-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
0-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
0-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
0-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
0-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
0-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
0-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
0-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
0-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
0-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
0-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
0-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
0-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
0-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
0-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
0-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
0-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
0-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
0-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
0-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
0-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
0-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
0-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
0-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
0-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
0-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
0-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
0-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
0-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
0-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
0-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
0-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
0-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
0-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...
0-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
0-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
0-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
0-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
0-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
0-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
0-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
0-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
0-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
0-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
0-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
0-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
0-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
0-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
0-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
0-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
0-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
0-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
0-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
0-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
0-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
0-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
0-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
0-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
0-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
0-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
0-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
0-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
0-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
0-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
0-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
0-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
0-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
0-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
0-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
0-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
0-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
0-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
0-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
0-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
0-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
0-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
0-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
0-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
0-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
0-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
0-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
0-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
0-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
0-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
0-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
0-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
0-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
0-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
0-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
0-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
0-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
0-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
0-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
0-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
0-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
0-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
0-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
0-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
0-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
0-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
0-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
0-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
0-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
0-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
0-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
0-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
0-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
0-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
0-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
0-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
0-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
0-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
0-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
0-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
0-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
0-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
0-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
0-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
0-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
0-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
0-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
0-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
0-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
0-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
0-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
0-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
0-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
0-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
0-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
0-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
0-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
0-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
0-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
0-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
0-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
0-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
0-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
0-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
0-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
0-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
0-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
0-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
0-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
0-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
0-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
0-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
0-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
0-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
0-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
0-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
0-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
0-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
0-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
0-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
0-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
0-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
0-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
0-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
0-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
0-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
0-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
0-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
0-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
0-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
0-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
0-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
0-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
0-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
0-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
0-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
0-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
0-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
0-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
0-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
0-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
0-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
0-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
0-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
0-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
0-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
0-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
0-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
0-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
0-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
0-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
0-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
0-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
0-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
0-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
0-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
0-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
0-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
0-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
0-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
0-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
0-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
0-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
0-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
0-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
0-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
0-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
0-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
0-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
0-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
0-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.

0-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
0-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.

0-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
0-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
0-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?

0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
0-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
0-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
0-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
0-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
0-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
0-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.

0-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
0-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
0-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
0-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
0-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
0-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.

0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
0-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
0-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
0-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
0-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
0-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.

0-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
0-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
0-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
0-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>

0-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
0-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
0-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
0-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
0-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
0-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
0-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
0-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
0-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
0-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
0-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
0-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
0-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
0-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
0-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)

0-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
0-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
0-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
0-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
0-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
0-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
0-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
0-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
0-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
0-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
0-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
0-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
0-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
0-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
0-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
0-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
0-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
0-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
0-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
0-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
0-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
0-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
0-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
0-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
0-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
0-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
0-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
0-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
0-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
0-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
0-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
0-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
0-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
0-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
0-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
0-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
0-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
0-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
0-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
0-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
0-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
0-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
0-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
0-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
0-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
0-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
0-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
0-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
0-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
0-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
0-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
0-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
0-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...

1-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
1-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.

1-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
1-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
1-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
1-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
1-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
1-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
1-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...
1-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
1-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
1-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
1-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
1-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
1-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
1-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
1-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
1-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
1-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
1-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
1-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
1-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
1-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
1-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
1-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
1-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
1-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
1-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
1-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
1-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
1-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
1-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
1-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
1-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
1-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
1-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
1-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
1-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
1-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
1-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
1-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
1-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
1-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
1-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
1-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
1-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
1-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
1-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
1-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
1-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
1-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
1-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
1-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
1-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
1-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
1-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
1-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
1-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
1-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
1-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
1-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
1-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
1-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
1-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
1-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
1-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
1-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
1-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
1-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
1-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
1-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
1-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
1-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
1-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
1-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
1-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
1-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
1-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
1-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
1-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
1-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
1-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
1-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
1-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
1-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
1-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
1-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
1-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
1-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
1-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
1-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
1-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
1-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
1-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
1-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
1-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
1-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
1-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
1-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
1-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
1-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
1-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
1-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
1-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
1-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
1-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
1-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
1-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
1-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
1-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
1-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
1-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
1-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
1-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
1-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
1-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
1-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
1-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
1-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
1-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
1-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
1-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
1-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
1-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
1-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
1-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
1-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
1-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
1-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
1-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
1-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
1-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
1-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
1-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
1-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
1-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
1-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
1-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
1-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
1-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
1-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
1-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
1-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
1-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
1-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
1-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
1-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
1-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
1-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
1-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
1-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
1-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
1-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
1-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
1-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
1-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
1-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
1-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
1-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
1-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
1-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
1-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
1-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
1-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
1-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
1-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
1-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
1-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
1-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
1-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
1-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
1-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
1-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
1-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
1-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
1-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
1-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
1-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
1-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
1-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
1-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
1-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
1-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
1-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
1-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
1-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
1-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
1-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
1-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
1-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
1-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
1-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
1-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
1-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
1-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
1-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
1-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
1-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
1-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
1-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
1-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
1-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
1-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
1-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
1-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
1-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
1-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
1-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
1-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
1-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
1-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
1-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
1-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
1-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
1-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
1-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
1-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
1-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
1-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
1-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
1-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
1-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
1-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
1-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
1-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
1-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
1-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
1-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
1-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
1-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
1-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
1-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
1-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
1-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
1-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
1-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
1-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
1-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
1-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
1-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
1-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
1-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
1-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
1-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
1-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
1-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
1-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
1-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
1-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
1-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
1-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
1-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
1-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
1-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
1-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
1-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
1-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
1-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
1-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
1-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
1-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
1-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
1-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
1-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
1-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
1-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
1-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
1-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
1-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
1-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
1-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
1-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
1-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
1-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
1-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
1-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
1-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
1-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
1-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
1-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
1-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
1-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
1-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
1-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
1-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
1-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
1-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
1-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
1-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
1-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
1-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
1-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
1-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
1-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
1-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
1-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
1-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
1-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
1-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
1-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
1-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
1-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
1-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
1-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
1-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
1-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
1-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.


#lost sash
2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
2-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
2-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
2-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
2-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
2-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
2-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
2-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
2-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
2-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
2-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
2-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
2-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
2-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
2-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
2-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
2-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
2-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
2-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
2-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
2-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
2-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
2-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
2-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
2-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
2-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
2-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
2-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
2-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
2-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
2-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
2-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
2-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
2-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
2-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
2-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
2-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
2-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
2-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
2-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
2-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
2-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
2-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
2-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
2-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
2-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
2-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
2-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
2-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
2-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
2-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
2-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
2-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
2-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
2-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
2-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
2-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
2-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
2-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
2-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
2-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
2-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
2-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
2-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
2-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
2-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
2-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
2-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
2-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
2-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
2-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
2-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
2-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
2-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
2-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
2-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
2-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
2-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
2-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
2-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
2-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
2-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
2-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
2-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
2-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
2-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
2-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
2-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
2-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
2-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
2-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
2-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
2-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
2-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
2-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
2-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
2-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
2-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
2-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
2-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
2-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
2-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
2-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
2-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
2-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
2-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
2-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
2-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
2-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
2-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
2-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
2-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
2-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
2-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
2-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...
2-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
2-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
2-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
2-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
2-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...
2-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
2-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
2-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
2-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
2-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
2-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
2-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
2-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
2-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
2-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
2-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
2-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
2-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
2-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
2-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
2-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
2-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
2-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
2-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
2-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
2-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
2-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
2-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
2-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
2-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
2-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
2-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
2-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
2-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
2-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
2-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
2-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
2-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
2-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
2-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
2-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
2-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
2-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
2-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
2-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
2-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
2-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
2-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
2-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
2-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
2-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
2-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
2-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
2-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
2-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
2-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
2-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
2-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
2-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
2-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
2-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
2-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
2-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
2-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
2-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
2-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
2-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
2-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
2-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
2-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
2-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
2-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
2-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
2-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
2-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
2-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
2-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
2-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
2-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
2-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
2-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
2-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
2-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
2-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
2-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
2-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
2-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
2-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
2-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
2-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
2-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
2-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
2-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
2-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
2-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
2-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
2-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
2-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
2-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
2-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
2-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
2-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
2-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
2-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
2-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
2-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
2-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
2-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
2-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
2-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
2-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
2-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
2-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
2-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
2-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
2-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
2-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
2-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
2-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
2-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
2-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
2-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
2-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
2-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
2-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
2-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
2-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
2-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
2-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
2-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
2-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
2-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
2-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
2-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
2-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
2-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
2-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
2-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
2-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
2-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
2-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
2-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
2-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
2-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
2-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
2-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
2-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
2-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
2-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
2-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
2-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
2-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
2-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
2-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
2-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
2-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
2-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
2-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
2-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
2-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
2-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
2-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
2-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
2-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
2-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
2-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
2-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
2-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
2-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
2-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
2-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
2-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
2-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
2-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
2-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
2-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
2-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
2-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
2-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
2-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
2-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
2-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
2-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
2-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
2-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
2-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
2-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
2-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
2-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
2-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
2-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
2-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
2-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
2-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
2-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
2-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
2-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
2-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
2-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
2-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
2-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
2-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
2-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
2-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
2-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
2-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
2-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
2-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
2-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
2-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
2-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
2-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
2-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
2-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
2-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
2-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
2-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
2-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
2-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
2-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
2-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
2-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
2-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
2-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
2-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
2-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
2-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
2-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
2-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
2-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
2-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
2-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
2-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
2-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
2-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
2-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
2-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
2-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
2-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
2-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)

3-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
3-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
3-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
3-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
3-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
3-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
3-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
3-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
3-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
3-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
3-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
3-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
3-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
3-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
3-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
3-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
3-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
3-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
3-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
3-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
3-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
3-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
3-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
3-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
3-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
3-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
3-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
3-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
3-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
3-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
3-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
3-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
3-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
3-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
3-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
3-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
3-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
3-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
3-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
3-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
3-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
3-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
3-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
3-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
3-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
3-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
3-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
3-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
3-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
3-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
3-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
3-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
3-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
3-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
3-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
3-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
3-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
3-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
3-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
3-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
3-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
3-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
3-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
3-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
3-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
3-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
3-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
3-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
3-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
3-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
3-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
3-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
3-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
3-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
3-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
3-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
3-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
3-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
3-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
3-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
3-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
3-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
3-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
3-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
3-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
3-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
3-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
3-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
3-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
3-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
3-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
3-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
3-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
3-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
3-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
3-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
3-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
3-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
3-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
3-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
3-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
3-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
3-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
3-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
3-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
3-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
3-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
3-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...
3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
3-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
3-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
3-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
3-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
3-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
3-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
3-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
3-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
3-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
3-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
3-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
3-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
3-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
3-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
3-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
3-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
3-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
3-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
3-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
3-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
3-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
3-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
3-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
3-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
3-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
3-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
3-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
3-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
3-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
3-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
3-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
3-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
3-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
3-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
3-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
3-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
3-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
3-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
3-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
3-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.

3-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
3-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
3-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
3-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
3-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
3-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
3-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
3-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
3-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
3-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
3-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
3-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...

3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
3-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.

3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
3-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
3-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
3-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
3-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.

3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
3-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
3-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
3-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
3-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
3-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
3-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
3-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
3-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
3-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
3-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
3-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
3-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
3-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
3-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
3-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
3-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
3-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
3-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
3-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
3-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
3-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
3-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
3-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
3-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
3-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
3-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
3-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
3-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
3-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
3-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
3-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
3-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
3-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
3-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
3-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
3-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
3-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
3-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
3-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
3-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
3-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
3-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
3-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
3-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
3-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
3-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
3-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
3-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
3-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
3-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
3-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
3-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
3-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
3-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
3-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
3-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
3-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
3-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
3-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
3-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
3-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
3-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
3-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
3-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
3-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
3-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
3-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
3-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
3-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
3-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
3-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
3-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
3-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
3-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
3-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
3-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
3-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
3-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
3-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
3-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
3-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
3-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
3-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
3-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
3-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
3-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
3-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
3-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
3-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
3-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
3-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
3-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
3-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
3-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
3-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
3-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
3-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
3-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
3-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
3-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
3-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
3-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
3-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
3-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
3-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
3-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
3-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
3-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
3-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
3-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
3-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
3-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
3-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
3-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
3-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
3-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
3-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
3-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
3-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
3-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
3-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
3-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
3-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
3-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
3-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
3-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
3-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
3-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
3-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
3-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
3-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
3-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
3-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
3-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
3-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
3-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
3-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
3-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
3-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
3-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
3-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
3-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
3-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
3-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
3-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
3-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
3-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
3-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
3-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
3-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
3-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
3-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
3-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
3-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
3-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
3-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
3-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
3-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
3-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
3-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
3-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
3-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
3-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
3-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
3-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
3-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
3-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
3-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
3-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
3-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
3-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
3-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
3-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
3-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
3-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
3-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
3-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
3-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
3-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
3-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
3-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
3-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
3-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!


#lost tunic
4-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
4-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
4-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
4-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
4-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
4-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
4-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
4-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
4-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
4-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
4-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
4-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
4-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
4-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
4-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
4-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
4-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
4-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
4-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
4-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
4-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
4-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
4-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
4-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
4-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
4-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
4-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
4-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
4-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
4-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
4-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
4-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
4-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
4-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
4-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
4-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
4-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
4-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
4-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
4-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
4-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
4-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
4-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
4-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
4-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
4-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
4-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
4-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
4-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
4-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
4-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
4-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
4-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
4-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
4-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
4-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
4-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
4-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
4-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
4-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
4-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
4-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
4-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
4-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
4-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
4-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
4-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
4-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
4-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
4-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
4-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
4-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
4-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
4-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
4-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
4-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
4-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
4-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
4-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
4-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
4-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
4-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
4-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
4-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
4-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
4-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
4-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
4-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
4-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
4-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
4-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
4-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
4-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
4-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
4-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
4-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
4-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
4-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
4-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
4-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
4-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
4-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
4-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
4-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
4-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
4-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
4-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
4-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
4-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
4-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
4-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...
4-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
4-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
4-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
4-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
4-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
4-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
4-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
4-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
4-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
4-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
4-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
4-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
4-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
4-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
4-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
4-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
4-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
4-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
4-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
4-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
4-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
4-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
4-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
4-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
4-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
4-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
4-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
4-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
4-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
4-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
4-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
4-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
4-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...
4-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
4-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
4-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
4-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
4-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
4-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
4-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
4-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
4-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
4-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
4-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
4-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
4-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
4-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
4-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
4-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
4-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
4-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
4-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
4-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
4-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
4-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
4-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
4-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
4-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
4-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
4-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
4-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
4-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
4-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
4-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
4-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
4-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
4-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
4-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
4-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
4-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
4-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
4-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
4-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
4-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
4-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
4-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
4-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
4-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
4-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
4-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
4-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
4-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
4-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
4-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
4-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
4-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
4-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
4-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
4-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
4-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
4-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
4-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
4-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
4-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
4-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
4-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
4-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
4-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
4-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
4-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
4-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
4-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
4-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
4-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
4-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
4-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
4-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
4-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
4-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
4-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
4-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
4-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
4-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
4-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
4-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
4-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
4-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
4-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
4-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
4-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
4-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
4-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
4-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
4-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
4-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
4-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
4-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
4-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
4-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
4-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
4-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
4-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
4-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
4-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
4-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
4-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
4-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
4-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
4-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
4-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
4-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
4-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
4-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
4-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
4-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
4-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
4-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
4-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
4-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
4-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
4-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
4-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
4-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
4-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
4-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
4-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
4-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
4-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
4-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
4-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
4-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
4-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
4-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
4-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
4-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
4-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
4-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
4-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
4-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
4-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
4-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
4-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
4-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
4-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
4-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
4-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
4-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
4-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
4-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
4-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
4-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
4-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
4-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
4-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
4-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
4-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
4-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
4-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
4-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
4-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
4-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
4-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
4-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
4-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
4-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
4-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
4-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
4-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
4-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
4-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
4-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
4-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
4-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
4-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
4-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
4-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
4-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
4-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
4-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
4-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
4-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
4-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
4-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
4-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
4-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
4-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
4-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
4-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
4-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
4-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
4-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
4-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
4-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
4-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
4-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
4-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
4-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
4-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
4-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
4-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
4-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
4-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
4-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
4-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
4-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
4-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
4-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
4-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
4-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
4-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
4-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
4-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
4-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
4-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
4-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
4-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
4-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
4-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
4-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
4-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
4-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
4-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
4-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
4-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
4-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
4-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
4-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
4-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
4-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
4-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
4-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
4-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
4-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
4-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
4-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
4-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
4-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
4-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
4-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
4-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
4-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
4-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
4-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
4-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
4-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
4-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
4-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
4-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
4-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
4-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
4-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
4-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
4-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
4-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
4-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
4-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
4-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
4-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
4-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
4-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
4-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
4-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
4-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
4-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
4-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
4-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
4-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
4-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
4-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
4-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
4-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
4-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
4-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
4-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
4-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
4-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
4-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
4-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
4-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
4-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
4-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
4-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
4-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
4-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
4-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
4-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
4-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
4-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
4-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
4-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
4-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
4-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
4-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
4-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
4-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
4-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
4-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
4-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
4-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
4-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
4-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
4-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
4-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
4-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
4-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
4-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
4-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
4-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
4-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
4-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
4-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
4-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
4-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
4-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
4-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
4-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
4-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
4-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
4-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
4-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
4-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
4-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
4-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
4-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
4-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
4-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
4-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
4-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
4-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
4-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
4-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
4-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
4-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
4-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
4-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
4-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
4-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
4-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
4-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
4-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
4-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)

-3-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
-3-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
-3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
-3-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
-3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
-3-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
-3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
-3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
-3-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
-3-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
-3-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
-3-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
-3-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
-3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
-3-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
-3-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
-3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
-3-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
-3-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
-3-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
-3-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
-3-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
-3-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
-3-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
-3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
-3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
-3-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
-3-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
-3-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
-3-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
-3-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
-3-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
-3-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
-3-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
-3-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
-3-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
-3-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
-3-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
-3-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
-3-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
-3-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
-3-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
-3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
-3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
-3-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
-3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-3-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?

-3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
-3-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
-3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
-3-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?

-3-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
-3-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
-3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.

-3-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
-3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
-3-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
-3-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
-3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
-3-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.

-3-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
-3-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
-3-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
-3-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
-3-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
-3-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
-3-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
-3-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
-3-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
-3-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
-3-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
-3-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
-3-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
-3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
-3-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
-3-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
-3-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
-3-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
-3-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
-3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
-3-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
-3-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
-3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-3-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
-3-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
-3-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
-3-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
-3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
-3-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=shy,This better be worth it...
-3-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
-3-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
-3-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
-3-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
-3-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
-3-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
-3-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
-3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
-3-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
-3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
-3-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
-3-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
-3-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
-3-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
-3-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
-3-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
-3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
-3-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
-3-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
-3-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
-3-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
-3-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
-3-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
-3-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
-3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
-3-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
-3-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
-3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
-3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
-3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
-3-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
-3-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
-3-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...
-3-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
-3-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
-3-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
-3-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
-3-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
-3-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
-3-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
-3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-3-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
-3-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
-3-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
-3-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
-3-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
-3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
-3-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
-3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
-3-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
-3-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
-3-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
-3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
-3-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
-3-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
-3-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
-3-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
-3-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
-3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
-3-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
-3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
-3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
-3-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
-3-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
-3-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
-3-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
-3-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
-3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
-3-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
-3-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
-3-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
-3-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
-3-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
-3-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
-3-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
-3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
-3-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
-3-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-3-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
-3-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
-3-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
-3-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
-3-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
-3-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
-3-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
-3-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
-3-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
-3-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
-3-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
-3-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
-3-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
-3-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
-3-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
-3-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
-3-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
-3-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
-3-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
-3-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
-3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
-3-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
-3-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
-3-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
-3-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
-3-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
-3-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
-3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
-3-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
-3-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
-3-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
-3-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
-3-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
-3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
-3-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
-3-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
-3-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
-3-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
-3-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
-3-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
-3-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
-3-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
-3-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
-3-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
-3-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
-3-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
-3-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
-3-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
-3-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
-3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
-3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
-3-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
-3-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
-3-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
-3-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
-3-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
-3-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
-3-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
-3-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
-3-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
-3-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
-3-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
-3-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
-3-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
-3-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
-3-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
-3-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
-3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
-3-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
-3-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
-3-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
-3-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
-3-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
-3-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
-3-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
-3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
-3-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
-3-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
-3-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
-3-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
-3-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
-3-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
-3-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
-3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
-3-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
-3-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
-3-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
-3-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
-3-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
-3-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
-3-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
-3-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
-3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
-3-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
-3-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
-3-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
-3-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
-3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
-3-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
-3-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
-3-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
-3-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
-3-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
-3-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
-3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
-3-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
-3-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
-3-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
-3-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
-3-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
-3-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
-3-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
-3-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
-3-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
-3-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
-3-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
-3-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
-3-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
-3-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
-3-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
-3-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
-3-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
-3-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
-3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
-3-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
-3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
-3-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
-3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
-3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
-3-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
-3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
-3-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
-3-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
-3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
-3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
-3-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
-3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
-3-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
-3-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
-3-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
-3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
-3-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
-3-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
-3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
-3-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
-3-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
-3-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
-3-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
-3-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
-3-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
-3-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
-3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
-3-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
-3-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
-3-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
-3-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
-3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
-3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
-3-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
-3-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
-3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
-3-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
-3-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
-3-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
-3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
-3-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
-3-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
-3-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
-3-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
-3-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
-3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
-3-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
-3-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=embarrassed,A P-Pit sandwich? You don't have to go that far, b-but thanks for the offer!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
-3-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
-3-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
-3-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
-3-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
-3-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
-3-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
-3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
-3-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
-3-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
-3-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
-3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
-3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
-3-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
-3-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
-3-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
-3-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
-3-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
-3-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
-3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
-3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
-3-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
-3-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
-3-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
-3-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
-3-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
-3-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
-3-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
-3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
-3-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
-3-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
-3-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
-3-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
-3-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
-3-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
-3-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
-3-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
-3-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
-3-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
-3-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
-3-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
-3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
-3-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
-3-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
-3-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
-3-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
-3-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
-3-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
-3-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
-3-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
-3-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
-3-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
-3-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
-3-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
-3-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
-3-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
-3-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
-3-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
-3-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?

-2-male_removing_major=shy,Anything to get the attention off me.
-2-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
-2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
-2-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
-2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
-2-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
-2-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
-2-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
-2-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
-2-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
-2-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
-2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
-2-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
-2-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
-2-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
-2-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
-2-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
-2-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
-2-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
-2-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
-2-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
-2-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
-2-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
-2-male_removed_major=beat,I'll be over here, but you go ahead and enjoy ~name~'s body.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
-2-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
-2-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
-2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
-2-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
-2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
-2-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
-2-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
-2-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
-2-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
-2-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
-2-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
-2-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
-2-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
-2-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
-2-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
-2-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
-2-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
-2-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
-2-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
-2-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
-2-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
-2-female_removing_major=awkward,Are you choosing the ~clothing~ because you don't have a choice... or because you want to help me out?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
-2-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
-2-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
-2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-2-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
-2-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
-2-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
-2-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
-2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
-2-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
-2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
-2-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
-2-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
-2-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
-2-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
-2-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!

-2-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
-2-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
-2-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
-2-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
-2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
-2-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
-2-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
-2-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
-2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
-2-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
-2-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...
-2-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
-2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
-2-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=beat,I don't think this was worth it anymore.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
-2-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
-2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
-2-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
-2-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
-2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
-2-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
-2-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
-2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-2-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
-2-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
-2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
-2-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
-2-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
-2-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
-2-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
-2-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
-2-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
-2-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
-2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
-2-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
-2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
-2-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
-2-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
-2-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
-2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
-2-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
-2-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
-2-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
-2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
-2-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
-2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
-2-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
-2-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
-2-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
-2-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=stunned,It does? Oh, then yeah. Definitely go for the skirt!
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:2=devoted,Okay, I'm watching...
-2-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
-2-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
-2-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
-2-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
-2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:3=shy,I'm getting nervous here...
-2-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
-2-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...
-2-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
-2-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
-2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
-2-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
-2-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
-2-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
-2-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
-2-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
-2-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
-2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
-2-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,Not anymore you aren't...
-2-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
-2-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
-2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
-2-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
-2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
-2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
-2-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
-2-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
-2-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
-2-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
-2-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
-2-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
-2-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
-2-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
-2-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
-2-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
-2-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
-2-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
-2-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
-2-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
-2-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
-2-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
-2-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
-2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
-2-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
-2-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
-2-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
-2-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
-2-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
-2-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
-2-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
-2-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
-2-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
-2-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
-2-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
-2-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
-2-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
-2-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
-2-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
-2-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
-2-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
-2-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
-2-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
-2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
-2-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
-2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
-2-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
-2-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
-2-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
-2-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
-2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
-2-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
-2-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
-2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
-2-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
-2-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
-2-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
-2-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
-2-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
-2-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
-2-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
-2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
-2-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
-2-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
-2-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
-2-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
-2-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
-2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
-2-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
-2-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
-2-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-2-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
-2-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
-2-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
-2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
-2-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
-2-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
-2-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
-2-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
-2-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
-2-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
-2-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
-2-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
-2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
-2-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
-2-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
-2-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
-2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
-2-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
-2-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
-2-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
-2-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
-2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
-2-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
-2-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
-2-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
-2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
-2-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
-2-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
-2-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
-2-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
-2-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
-2-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
-2-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
-2-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
-2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
-2-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
-2-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
-2-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
-2-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
-2-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
-2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:blake=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-2-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:neo=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-2-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
-2-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
-2-female_removed_major=shy,Oh... I think that'll really help.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
-2-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
-2-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
-2-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
-2-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
-2-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
-2-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
-2-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
-2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
-2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
-2-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
-2-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
-2-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
-2-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
-2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
-2-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
-2-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
-2-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
-2-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
-2-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
-2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
-2-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
-2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
-2-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
-2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
-2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
-2-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
-2-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
-2-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
-2-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
-2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
-2-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
-2-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
-2-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
-2-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
-2-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
-2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
-2-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
-2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
-2-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
-2-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
-2-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
-2-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
-2-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
-2-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
-2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
-2-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
-2-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
-2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
-2-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
-2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
-2-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
-2-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
-2-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
-2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
-2-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
-2-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
-2-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
-2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
-2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
-2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
-2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
-2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
-2-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
-2-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
-2-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
-2-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
-2-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
-2-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
-2-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
-2-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
-2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
-2-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
-2-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
-2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
-2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
-2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
-2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
-2-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
-2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
-2-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
-2-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
-2-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
-2-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
-2-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
-2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
-2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
-2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
-2-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
-2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
-2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
-2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
-2-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
-2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
-2-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
-2-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
-2-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
-2-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
-2-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
-2-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
-2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:mlb,alsoPlaying:marinette=shy,Really? MLB?
-2-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.
-2-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
-2-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
-2-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
-2-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
-2-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
-2-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
-2-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
-2-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
-2-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
-2-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
-2-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
-2-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
-2-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
-2-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
-2-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
-2-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
-2-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
-2-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
-2-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
-2-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
-2-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
-2-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
-2-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
-2-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
-2-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
-2-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
-2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
-2-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
-2-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. Even if you had ten more layers,anyone who could beat me would give you a nice challenge!
-2-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
-2-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
-2-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
-2-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
-2-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
-2-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
-2-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
-2-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
-2-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=shy,Well, it doesn't really help either of us, all things considered.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
-2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
-2-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
-2-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
-2-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
-2-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
-2-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
-2-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
-2-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
-2-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
-2-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
-2-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
-2-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
-2-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
-2-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
-2-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
-2-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
-2-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
-2-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
-2-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
-2-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
-2-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
-2-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
-2-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
-2-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
-2-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
-2-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
-2-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
-2-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
-2-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
-2-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
-2-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?

-1-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=happy,I'll pass. Unlike you, I'm as straight as my arows.
-1-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:2=awkward,When I heard we were playing with <i>the</i> Mettaton, I expected the rectangular version...
-1-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=smug,And here go the <i>other</i> leggings.
-1-male_removing_major,target:caleb,targetStage:3=beat,The pants next? This is going by pretty fast...
-1-male_removing_major,target:ryu,targetStage:3=shy,Well, this is a lousy turn of events.
-1-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=shy,Seriously. I'd like to be teleported too.
-1-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:aimee=happy,Could be worse. Aimee could make you bite a real bullet, or something.
-1-male_removing_major,target:xander,targetStage:5=pumped,Everything's going according to plan!
-1-male_removing_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:3=smug,Hello and goodbye!
-1-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=joking,Looks like you got the <i>short</i> end of the stick this round. Eh? Eh?
-1-male_removing_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:3=awkward,Just get an apron, I guess.
-1-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=beat,Oh. You... did you give up and accept it?
-1-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:6=stunned,First Yoshi, now Mewtwo? Are we having a reunion here?
-1-male_removing_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=awkward,(I think Mettaton's just gotten bored now.)
-1-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:5=sad,I don't like that term, fictional. Makes it seem like we don't matter at all...
-1-male_removing_major,target:jin=surprised,Not... really.
-1-male_removing_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=happy,Could be worse. It's not a real bullet.
-1-male_removing_major,target:fred,targetStage:3=annoyed,Ehehe, no.
-1-male_removing_major,target:link,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm guessing the tunic's up next?
-1-male_removing_major,target:kira,targetStage:4=thinking,Gesundheit?
-1-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=sad,Don't be a thief, Nines. It won't work out.
-1-male_removing_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:5=shy,Here we go again, I guess.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=beat,I, uh, don't think that would work. Because... reasons.
-1-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:4=annoyed,You're not even nude yet!
-1-male_removed_major,target:mettaton,targetStage:3=stunned,Another layer of... clothing? Prepared, I see.
-1-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, cool.
-1-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:7=beat,I doubt it could be that much different.
-1-male_removed_major,target:kira,targetStage:5=stunned,(I think I understood something. Wait, no I didn't.)
-1-male_removed_major,target:shaggy,targetStage:4=determined,Focus! You can still win, you know!
-1-male_removed_major,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=smug,What a title to have.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7,targetNotSaidMarker:ravespy,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=annoyed,Good. I don't want to see you naked either.
-1-male_removed_major,target:fred,targetStage:4=beat,Gonna need a second opinion on that. What do you think, ~player~?
-1-male_removed_major,target:jin=smug,What's the matter, Jin? Tougher than you thought?
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:7=shy,O-oh! Guess that shield wound up useful after all...
-1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=thinking,Uhh... are you into this sort of thing?
-1-male_removed_major,target:ryu,targetStage:4=awkward,Me too, old friend. Me too.
-1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:futaba=annoyed,Well...guess that's a little cool.
-1-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:4=victory,Don't worry, we all know mine is cooler.
-1-male_removed_major,target:xander,targetStage:6=beat,N-Not that this is something I wanted to see. Ew.
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5=beat,Not that I'm one to talk, but maybe you should've worn pants anyway.
-1-male_removed_major,target:caleb,targetStage:4=pumped,Better prepare yourself then. We're not done yet!
-1-male_removed_major,target:link,targetStage:6=joking,I guess what matters now is you losing this game.
-1-male_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
-1-male_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
-1-male_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey, not half bad.
-1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=beat,(Am I the only one not understanding any of his sci-fi mumbo jumbo?)
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:6=stunned,Even your choice of underwear is intense, Captain!
-1-male_removed_major,target:captain_america,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy=smug,Spies aren't even scary!
-1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=sad,Oh. It was just a diversion?
-1-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=calm,It's times like these where you should have a nice meal. Works great on health restoration.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:5=surprised,I, uh, don't think I'd be much help. Zippers aren't really common in Skyworld.
-1-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:3=pumped,Haha! Yes!
-1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=surprised,Wait, shouldn't you move the camera first?
-1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=surprised,Take all the time you need, Mahiru. I'm not in a rush.
-1-female_removing_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=smug,Thrift mart out of red stockings?
-1-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=sad,Man, I wish I had a trump card. All I have is what you can see.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:3=beat,I almost wish I had a pair of baggy pants. Or... any long pants.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4=awkward,I'm still not convinced they won't turn out to have some sort of hidden supercomputer or something.
-1-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=smug,That's not what your face says!
-1-female_removing_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=victory,You know what? I admit, I'm having fun. That smile is infectious.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=surprised,Not gonna lie. I'm a little scared.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=stunned,Huh? Was that on a timer or something?
-1-female_removing_major,target:seven,targetStage:1=happy,Maybe I can show you some hot springs later. Those are great for regeneration!
-1-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:3=stunned,There could be anything under that jacket...
-1-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=stunned,Are they going somewhere? More importantly, can I go with them?
-1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,Those legs are really impressive, Chun-Li. Maybe I oughta try out your workout routine sometime.
-1-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=happy,See? We can put up a pretty good fight.
-1-female_removing_major,target:willow,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad for you too.
-1-female_removing_major,target:calisto,targetStage:4=beat,And I was rooting for you a little, too...
-1-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:4=sad,It was only a matter of time.
-1-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=thinking,So you're not wearing leggings under there?
-1-female_removing_major,target:shantae,targetStage:3=beat,I hope you're wearing something under there.
-1-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:4=smug,I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not exactly feeling sorry for you either way.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zoey,targetStage:3=awkward,Where's the jacket's obituary? That covered more.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=beat,That didn't last long.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=happy,Hey, that was easier than I thought!
-1-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:3=beat,Yeah, not worth it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=devoted,Let's press on!
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=calm,That shirt's really pretty. I bet Viridi would love the pattern on it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=awkward,From the beach to a strip poker game, huh...
-1-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:4=shy,I never know what to say in this sort of situation.
-1-female_removing_major,target:lyn,targetStage:5=awkward,If only your tactician was with you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=smug,What were your words earlier? "I won't lose again"?
-1-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,count-tommy:1=happy,Oh. Lucky you, Tommy!
-1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=surprised,Yep, you got it! I promise I won't stare!
-1-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I don't want that!
-1-female_removing_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=joking,I apologize in advance.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=angry,What? Is your bra soul-shaped too?
-1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad you're respecting the rules, but are you sure you want to do this?
-1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=awkward,I thought I was doing better about that.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=annoyed,Oh, wonderful. The bad one's back.
-1-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:3=annoyed,Trust me, I'm well aware.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=awkward,It <i>is</i> a nice sweatshirt.
-1-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:2-4=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before tonight...
-1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:3=determined,You're right. This was your choice.
-1-female_removing_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=awkward,Humans <i>are</i> driven by desire, or so I've heard.
-1-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:3,totalExposed:0=shy,I'm just as embarrassed as you are, you know... I've never seen a woman naked before...
-1-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=beat,And her self-confidence just crashed and burned.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stunned,Learn something new everyday... wait, that didn't even sound like a spider fact!
-1-female_removing_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=shy,(I admit, I would like to see if her legs are as toned as her stomach...)
-1-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:3=shy,I thought that was a second jacket...
-1-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=beat,I'd offer to help, but...
-1-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm not exactly the type to look up stuff like that.
-1-female_removing_major,target:amalia,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're already losing your leaves-er, skirt?
-1-female_removing_major,target:samus,targetStage:2=shy,If you need help, I can... oh, never mind.
-1-female_removing_major,target:lilith,targetStage:5=beat,I actually have some invisibility powers too. Doubt Lady Palutena would let me use them though.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayla,targetStage:2=angry,Why would I want used tights anyways?
-1-female_removing_major,target:hermione,targetStage:4=smug,Good. Glad you're finally getting into it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=beat,I didn't even notice they were so tight.
-1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking,Wonder what Link would say about this...
-1-female_removing_major,target:chara,targetStage:3=awkward,(Those must've been a loose fit back then.)
-1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=happy,I can appreciate a good set of yoga pants. Hey, you think they'd ever make yoga shorts for me?
-1-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3,count-weiss_v4:1=shy,(With how she acts, I think that won't be for a long time.)
-1-female_removing_major,target:alice=surprised,Wait! Don't you want to take off the stockings first?
-1-female_removing_major,target:alpha=beat,I didn't realize you could feel embarrassment... is that offensive?
-1-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=beat,Those tights are pretty iconic. Shame they have to go.
-1-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:3=surprised,Just pantyhose... it's not the end of the world...
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=shy,You're getting really worked up! Just take some deep breaths, and I'll hear you out.
-1-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2=shy,Nothing can possibly go wrong here. Right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=shy,I'm glad you found a bra at all...
-1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3=thinking,Is this where that "anti-upskirt technology" goes?
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:4=surprised,...That's an effective trick.
-1-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:4=beat,Sorry. I'll give you a minute.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=beat,Is it though? I mean, it could be worse, but- know what? Never mind.
-1-female_removing_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=awkward,Thank you?
-1-female_removing_major,target:tina,targetStage:4=awkward,Is that an accomplishment?
-1-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:4=shy,Anything is better than those earrings...
-1-female_removing_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=shy,Already? Feels like you just started losing hands...
-1-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,Actually, you have a website, don't you? What was it about again...
-1-female_removing_major,target:tifa,targetStage:3,marker:puns=joking,Couldn't <i>skirt</i> by this one!
-1-female_removing_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=thinking,I don't really think those count as pants. Would you walk around in public with those?
-1-female_removing_major,target:riva,targetStage:3=shy,Disgusting?
-1-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=beat,I'll give you a minute.
-1-female_removing_major,target:pearl,targetStage:2=thinking,It did look pretty thin. What <i>is</i> the point of it?
-1-female_removing_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:4=thinking,I've never heard of that. You humans will use any excuse to get down and dirty, won't you?
-1-female_removing_major,target:spooky,targetStage:1=surprised,Yeah, no kidding.
-1-female_removing_major,target:penny,targetStage:2=joking,I won't rush you. At least, not yet.
-1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3=devoted,Winning this makes me feel pretty good as is.
-1-female_removing_major,target:piper,targetStage:6=awkward,Just wear 'em into the hot springs! That's what I do.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sonya,targetStage:4=victory,I mean, this'll do... for now.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zelda,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh, here we go!
-1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Finally showing your true form!
-1-female_removing_major,target:revy,targetStage:4=thinking,Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing you came in a little underdressed.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:1=happy,Cool shirt! Didn't it have an Aperture logo on it, though?
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=awkward,How thoughful of it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chell,targetStage:3=joking,Finally losing the jumpsuit, Chell?
-1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=awkward,(Why is this girl's attitude so relatable?)
-1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=thinking,Should I write this down?
-1-female_removing_major,target:amy_rose=surprised,So soon? What happened to the headband?
-1-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4=thinking,We talking humid hot or dry hot? There's a difference, you know.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:4=calm,Yeah, no. Go ahead.
-1-female_removing_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
-1-female_removing_major,target:arwen=awkward,Guess this dress means a lot to you, huh?
-1-female_removing_major,target:beatrix=joking,I think your proverbs are a bit off.
-1-female_removing_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=stunned,Now that I take a closer look, they <i>do</i> look pretty tight.
-1-female_removing_major,target:weiss,targetStage:3=shy,This is why I checked the rules before I came here.
-1-female_removing_major,target:velma=annoyed,Why do I feel this is your fault, ~player~?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=smug,You got this, Sheena!
-1-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=awkward,It's going to be more of the same. Calling it now.
-1-female_removing_major,target:shego,targetStage:3=beat,Is that so? Hard to imagine...
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:4=joking,I can confirm, not wearing pants is oddly liberating.
-1-female_removing_major,target:angie,targetStage:3=shy,Looks like we're starting to amp up.
-1-female_removing_major,target:videl,targetStage:3=awkward,I guess this is a little weird, but I'm also a little excited.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:3=happy,'Kay.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=happy,Yep! Why, is it not?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=shy,S-sorry, that's not up to me to decide...
-1-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=beat,I didn't think that. Then again, I didn't <i>not</i> think that either... what I'm trying to say is, this is a subject I'd rather not think about.
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=devoted,You...do a very good job.
-1-female_removing_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=beat,R-right. Your pants are next. Or the belt, whatever you prefer.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sheva,targetStage:6=annoyed,Got a "safety net" down there too?
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=sad,I guess so, huh...
-1-female_removing_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=thinking,It just slides off? That's convenient.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smug,Well, Senketsu has a date with the floor right now.
-1-female_removing_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:2=awkward,The only mystery afoot is how I got in this mess in the first place.
-1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=annoyed,Ugh. Laundry. There's a reason I wear my clothes into the hot springs.
-1-female_removing_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=stunned,Not the apron? I was <i>sure</i> that was what you'd pick next.
-1-female_removing_major,target:shazza,targetStage:3=awkward,Ooh, the jeans huh? Finally onto the heavy stuff with you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:3=stunned,Um, down. No wait, up! Shoot, I can't decide!
-1-female_removing_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,totalMales:4=stunned,Cowardly? I'm just playing the game...
-1-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry, we're gonna have to cut this stripping sequence <i>short</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=awkward,What do you think of this, Link... oh. Right.
-1-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=annoyed,If you really wanted to be modest, you wouldn't have come here.
-1-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:4=smug,I totally didn't see this coming.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,And I was sure she wasn't. Look who wound up being right.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3=joking,I can turn around if it makes it easier for you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=surprised,(Don't tell me she forgot the stockings too.)
-1-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0=awkward,Everyone has bad luck every once in a while. It'll pass.
-1-female_removing_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=stunned,What a surprise! You have self-respect?
-1-female_removing_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:1=shy,R-really? So soon?
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=shy,Your memory's slipping already.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:4=shy,I think I can guess why.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=surprised,I don't judge. Lady Palutena on the other hand...
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=thinking,Why would you? She's a pirate.
-1-female_removing_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=shy,Umm... I'm going to take a guess and say you're matching.
-1-female_removing_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:4=beat,Aw, finally losing the costume?
-1-female_removing_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=calm,Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not a total pervert.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=stunned,Already, Chun-Li? That can't be all you have.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=happy,I don't need a mask. I wear my heart on my non-existant sleeve.
-1-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:3=stunned,Now you're cold?
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Is your web really that strong?
-1-female_removing_major,target:korra,targetStage:4=shy,Getting right to it...

-1-female_removing_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=determined,You can count on me for that much!
-1-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,For once, no.
-1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=stunned,What? You know Snake?
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=shy,Is that one piece? This'll go quicker than I thought...
-1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena,count-yang:1=surprised,You think that's bad? Try playing with your <i>boss</i>!
-1-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2=shy,That's a gross way of putting it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:hope,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking,No offense, but you don't seem fine.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=beat,One's enough, thank you very much.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=joking,Hey, you've got it easy. A swimsuit is a lot less embarrassing than plain old underwear.
-1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=smug,Oh, spicing it up, I see. I like it!
-1-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:3=shy,Ehehehe... so you do.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ayano,targetStage:4=happy,That's nice. I love the beach!
-1-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:2=stunned,Did someone say jam? Are we having jam?
-1-female_removing_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=determined,Stay strong, Elena. We're here for you!
-1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=stunned,A twofer? You really wanna gamble that much away?
-1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=stunned,What's this now? Already?
-1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=joking,Don't take it too hard. Even geniuses like me get beaten down by this game.
-1-female_removing_major,target:asuna,targetStage:4=angry,Is that really what you're concerned with right now?
-1-female_removing_major,target:elaine,targetStage:3=awkward,Maybe we are lucky... or maybe you just got unlucky.
-1-female_removing_major,target:daisy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Deep breaths...
-1-female_removing_major,target:evie,targetStage:4=beat,I'm glad it's a one piece. I was running out of puns.
-1-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=surprised,I'm not like that at all! I was framed!
-1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=surprised,You're not wearing shorts under there?
-1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=smug,What do you think of this, Link? She <i>is</i> yours, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:faye,targetStage:4=thinking,Uh... I really don't think that should count, but if the rest of you are okay with it...
-1-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5=shy,...I'll close my eyes for this.
-1-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=thinking,How many layers of shirt do you have right now?
-1-female_removing_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-1-female_removing_major,target:aella,targetStage:3=beat,Right. Leggings it is.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:3=shy,They're... not the worst things in the world. Unless they're on a Mimicutie.
-1-female_removing_major,target:tracer,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=beat,So many time machines these days...
-1-female_removing_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:3=beat,I'm not sure if I should happy or scared you're being so generous.
-1-female_removing_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:5=smug,Is it really that surprising? C'mon, you're good, but not <i>that</i> good.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=awkward,I see no skirts on you.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=shy,Well, when you put it like that...

-1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprised,Hey! Are you insane?!
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1=stunned,But your secret secrets will be revealed!
-1-female_removing_major,target:dawn,targetStage:3=smug,I beg to differ. Everything's important in this type of game, Dawn.
-1-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=beat,You do realize there's no Tommy here, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5=joking,You came up a bit <i>short</i> that hand, huh?
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash=awkward,I was wondering who that was.
-1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Chun-Li's an officer? I guess everyone needs a day job...
-1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=determined,I can handle this... humans and divine ladies may set me off, but you have nothing on me!
-1-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:2=beat,It really doesn't seem that tough.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=sad,Distractions? What are we, children?
-1-female_removing_major,target:mia,targetStage:3=smug,You're backed into a corner already?
-1-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:3=stunned,Huh. You know, I wasn't expecting abs. But they totally make sense in hindsight.
-1-female_removing_major,target:gwen,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Good call there. I'd rather not worry about leaks here, y'know?
-1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=beat,Alright, alright...
-1-female_removing_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=beat,Add that to the top ten phrases I wasn't expecting to hear tonight...

-1-female_removing_major,target:sei,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gogo=calm,This concludes Engineering with Sei. And not a moment too soon!
-1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,If it makes you feel better, I don't care what underwear you picked. You look amazing even in these "cutesy" ones!
-1-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=shy,True. It's not like we couldn't see midriff already.
-1-female_removing_major,target:mercy,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Well, it's not like Mercy could fly or anything.
-1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=stunned,W-what?
-1-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=beat,You got talked into it too?
-1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=annoyed,Remember, no funny business.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,At this rate, this'll turn into a pirate battle.
-1-female_removing_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=joking,There's a severe lack of water around to consider this a naval situation.
-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_america=awkward,C'mon, Cappy. Even I don't get too worked up over a bodysuit.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=beat,Well, either choice was gonna be bad.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=smug,I'll just save my secret identity joke for your next loss.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ruby,targetStage:3,count-yang:1=awkward,At least you have each other?
-1-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=surprised,<i>You're</i> nervous? I'm sweating bullets over here!
-1-female_removing_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:3=shy,You could go for <i>just</i> the tie, you know...
-1-female_removing_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=shy,Please don't tease me like this...
-1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=beat,I hope you're aware of how dangerous a succubus can be, ~player~.
-1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=beat,Don't really know what to say. Anyway I can make it easier? Need me to look away?
-1-female_removing_major,target:moon,targetStage:0=surprised,That's... different.
-1-female_removing_major,target:april,targetStage:4=thinking,Well, duh.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I guess it <i>is</i> like those armorless runs you see in some games.
-1-female_removing_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=joking,Sure. But I don't think most beaches have you undressing even more from swimsuit-level.
-1-female_removing_major,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mei_overdressed=awkward,I wouldn't mind it either, y'know.
-1-female_removing_major,target:misato,targetStage:3=shy,We're the lucky ones. I think?
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:sharla=thinking,Doesn't one of Sharla's friends go around like that? Dunban, I think?
-1-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=calm,I bet he and I would get along great.
-1-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:4=calm,Take all the time you need. I'm a patient angel.
-1-female_removing_major,target:misty,targetStage:1=awkward,I bet they'd just fall down anyway after you took off the suspenders.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:link=angry,Stop influencing her, Link! She'll corrupt her whole class at this rate!
-1-female_removing_major,target:may,targetStage:5=shy,You got it.
-1-female_removing_major,target:kim,targetStage:3=thinking,That's a silly name for a store. Why name it after a weapon?
-1-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=joking,Just take it slow if you need to. No need to rush. Again.
-1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-1-female_removing_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:fred=annoyed,You heard the lady! Take responsibility!
-1-female_removing_major,target:yang,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Uh, yes. You have to.
-1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=thinking,Your HP's getting low, huh? You going to throw a second form at us or something?
-1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=beat,Belts aren't that big. This... <i>should</i> be fine.
-1-female_removing_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=happy,Hoop earrings, huh? See, those are a lot rarer. If anything should be your trademark, it should be that.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Darn kids and your newfangled euphamisms...
-1-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=awkward,Don't worry, Monika. We're all in the same boat... more or less.
-1-female_removing_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=beat,Gotta follow them, even if you don't like them. I certainly don't.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zizou=angry,That is <i>clearly</i> not 'nothing'!
-1-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,Please leave <i>me</i> out of that.

-1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:shantae,totalMasturbating:1-4=stunned,Oh, uh, please don't grant that for her, Shantae.
-1-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:5=awkward,You're a little less green now. Must be autumn.
-1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=thinking,Huh. Guess you do.
-1-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=embarrassed,Please, spare us the details! I don't need to hear about Asuna's... adventures.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mei=shy,...Snow-<i>Angel</i>? Are you making fun of me, too?
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Can you even be romantic here?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,So, uh... maybe you oughta... give your underwear a little tug?
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=surprised,Rinkah, your... y'know... don't make me say it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Uh, Rinkah? Your bottoms are a little small...
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=shy,Rinkah, I think you should, I dunno, fix... <i>that</i>?
-1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I liked it, at least.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shego,targetStage:4=awkward,(I give her points for flair if nothing else.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=annoyed,Don't demean yourself like that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=shy,MLB?
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=awkward,But this isn't the Spiderverse, is it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:riva,targetStage:4=smug,Who's the pervert now, Ms. Tiny Thong?
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=beat,Well, I know you're not talking about me.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,I hear she's had some crazy plot twists. But that's for another time, I think.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,Yeah! I'm innocent!
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=determined,Yeah! Not everyone's as shameless as you, purple.
-1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:sonya=joking,What a mystery.
-1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request Mia be my attorney.
-1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mahiru=beat,What's on your mind, Amalia?
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=happy,I hope we can become good friends too.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:freudianslip=loss,Don't rub it. In! Don't rub it in!
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,Hey, that's not fair at all! You can't win clothes back!
-1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:6=shy,Don't worry. You're so cute, it's almost sickening.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=beat,At least you're wearing a full set of underwear. Wait, you totally could've taken off the stockings first!
-1-female_removed_major,target:rosalina,targetStage:3=joking,Hey, it's not just a black hole under there after all!
-1-female_removed_major,target:peach,targetStage:5=beat,Man, I haven't seen those bloomers since 2008... stupid censorship.
-1-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=joking,I had my doubts you were <i>all</i> talk, but... anyway, moving on.
-1-female_removed_major,target:pearl,targetStage:3=devoted,Lady Palutena's gift given life... amazing!
-1-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=annoyed,No, it didn't. I can attest to that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:samus,targetStage:3=awkward,I was worried you weren't wearing anything under it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:3=beat,Sounds tough. That's why I don't bother with long pants.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4=pumped,What are you talking about? This is the most serious of combat scenarios!
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayla,targetStage:4=angry,But-! That's cheating! C'mon...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:6=shy,(I almost want to just to see if I can take the hit.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:4=loss,Shoot... all they went to is the floor...
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=beat,Didn't take you for the striped type.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=awkward,It'd be more weird if you <i>did</i> like it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:4=beat,It's just kind of jarring going from your modern clothes to a furkini.
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Do we really have to keep going through with this?
-1-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:4=shy,You get it, right ~player~? Tell me I'm not the only one who caught that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:revy,targetStage:5=sad,It shouldn't, but it would've made me feel better.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. Even if you had ten more layers, anyone who could beat me would give you a nice challenge!
-1-female_removed_major,target:alice=beat,Please hold on to your modesty, or sanity, or whatever it is.
-1-female_removed_major,target:velma=shy,If only that sweater was, I dunno, half an inch longer...
-1-female_removed_major,target:beatrix=embarrassed,Even so, it didn't have to be your <i>first choice</i>!
-1-female_removed_major,target:arwen=shy,I didn't take you for the type to use binds, Arwen.
-1-female_removed_major,target:amy_rose=pumped,I hope so too, Amy. But I won't make it easy!
-1-female_removed_major,target:alpha=joking,Just hope this game doesn't leak out or anything.
-1-female_removed_major,target:human=beat,Wow, way to bump the rating up to T for Teen.
-1-female_removed_major,target:human=stunned,Still not gonna talk? Seriously? Even after losing your ~clothing~?
-1-female_removed_major,target:human=happy,Hey hey, looking good!
-1-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No, no, it's fine. (It's good enough, at least...)
-1-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:6=surprised,I, uh... didn't expect you to be wearing... that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:paya,targetStage:5=shy,I've always wondered... are bindings like those common among the Sheikah?
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=angry,Well, she better start soon!
-1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=thinking,I wonder if anyone did plan on matching when coming here...
-1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ayano,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Ayano.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=beat,I was kind of hoping you'd just have another mask on underneath.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=awkward,Maybe it's best that the Equestrians never get weapons like these.
-1-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:3=devoted,With a design like that, I'm sure it would be comfy. (Might be a good birthday present for Lady Palutena.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=awkward,Well, now that you mention it...
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,C'mon, Meia. Be a bit more cheerful!
-1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=beat,Don't pick on her, Buffy. None of us like the rules.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=annoyed,Maybe you'd be more likeable if you revealed it more.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,Maybe grab a chair or something?
-1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:4=annoyed,This is a loaded question and I'd like to request an attorney.
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=happy,(Thanks for looking out for her, Nagisa. She looks like she needs it.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Clearly not the only thing you take pride in.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=beat,Annnnnnd she's ranting.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=beat,So much for that offer.
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2=shy,I'm glad you decided to wear panties tonight, at least.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=awkward,Your imagination will have to do.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=awkward,I guess someone who'd imitate an angel <i>would</i> have do delicate work.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,Have you ever tried, Ladybug?
-1-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=angry,Don't traumatize her any more than you already have!
-1-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stunned,Wait, seriously? You <i>have</i> to try one of the Wii Fit Trainer's workouts. They're amazing!
-1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5=thinking,...Yes?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=shy,I... don't really see tights as your style.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Normally it's the patient who gets naked for the doctor, y'know...
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=shy,And it all goes back to Sonya.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=annoyed,Surprised you didn't skimp out and go for the "technically two pieces" schtick like Sayla.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:6=shy,So why are you wearing that type of underwear? Aren't you British?
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:2=awkward,Is there any other way?
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=calm,Uh, no. I bet she's realizing I could have gotten a cool costume this whole time and is having regrets about it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,I always wondered what I'd look like in a costume... you really think I'd be handsome?
-1-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=surprised,No class trial would ever go like this!
-1-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:5=beat,It seems that way, yeah. Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=smug,Having matching underwear on laundry day? I don't think you're getting in the true spirit of it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:d.va_cruiser,targetStage:4=shy,Yeah... you definitely have a great figure, Hana...
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=beat,...I didn't realize that was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry if I came off as rude.
-1-female_removed_major,target:moon,targetStage:1=shy,Oh. Didn't even notice the shirt was that thin.
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=surprised,But I'm a guy...
-1-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=awkward,Just be careful, okay buddy?
-1-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=surprised,You... wear a thong?
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=awkward,Hey, I can appreciate functionality over laciness any day. They suit you.
-1-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:4=loss,Just a little longer...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:7=beat,Sure do. Greeeeaaaaat.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6=shy,You've got some nice abs. What's your secret?
-1-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:6=stunned,Yeah... it's... real nice.
-1-female_removed_major,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:5=awkward,Still, better than the alternative.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shy,(This Kazuichi isn't wrong... even if it is kind of blunt.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4=shy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon would be proud.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=annoyed,Oh. Don't scare me like that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:4=beat,<i>Doh!</i> Well, guess it won't really matter in the end...
-1-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:3=loss,<i>You</i> were the one in the trap? I thought we were having jam!
-1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm. I guess that was pretty cool.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=beat,I only answer to Lady Palutena... but I still don't enjoy seeing any of you like this.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jubilee,targetStage:5=shy,I can understand why you wouldn't wear a bra given your, uh... size. But I'm glad you had one today.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=awkward,I doubt many of us were prepared. I sure wasn't...
-1-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=thinking,I didn't think you were the stammering type, Monika. You seem so collected.
-1-female_removed_major,target:daphne,targetStage:4=shy,Right. Moving on.
-1-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=pumped,For real this time?
-1-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:3=beat,I imagine this is a lot colder than a pool for you, though.
-1-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:4=joking,The color looks good on you, you know.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:6=awkward,Man, remember when she still had her bra? Those were good times.
-1-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4=surprised,That's just how this game is. I'm sorry that this might not be your last loss.
-1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=joking,Yeah. They look really good! (Although I wonder if she'd be even cuter in a more mature set?)
-1-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I hadn't seen <i>any</i> girl in her underwear before tonight!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=beat,Sorry, but... kind of hard to get into it when your opponent is less than half your size...
-1-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:5=stunned,That's it! How fitting.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ami,targetStage:4=joking,Is this a trick question? ... although I genuinely find it cute.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheva,targetStage:5=sad,Yet another victim of the obligatory fanservice outfit.
-1-female_removed_major,target:amalia,targetStage:2=determined,Of course! Let's move on! Dealer, please.
-1-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:4=awkward,It's somehow both less <i>and</i> more risque than I thought.
-1-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:6=awkward,Is that...never mind.
-1-female_removed_major,target:neo,targetStage:5=calm,Not much left, huh?
-1-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:6=angry,You know it always gets worse. <i>Always.</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:4=shy,Good for you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:aiyana,targetStage:2=awkward,(Man, am I glad I don't get tanlines like those.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,Just keep doing your best, okay?
-1-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:3=annoyed,I don't need a sweater either! Don't you know anything about angels?
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=shy,That bra kind of looks like ice cream... oh, sorry. That was rude.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shy,At least you realized before you took your shirt off or something.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Who's staring? Not me, I swear!
-1-female_removed_major,target:misty,targetStage:2=calm,Well, you didn't exactly bundle up. Wait. Neither did I.
-1-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=beat,Everyone thinks they'll crush the competition. I bet you aren't the first to think that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:3=surprised,Those are some tight buns ...wait, you <i>are</i> gonna zip up again, right?
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:6=calm,Is that so? Maybe you'd like to train in Skyworld sometime.
-1-female_removed_major,target:annie_leonhart,targetStage:5=pumped,That's right! Never give up!
-1-female_removed_major,target:angie,targetStage:5=shy,If you're this embarrassed now... well, you know what's coming up.
-1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=stunned,Double pants? Impressive.
-1-female_removed_major,target:tifa,targetStage:4=thinking,Will there be more? Hmm. Guess we'll see.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6=beat,So... a thong, huh? You strike me as the type, but not the type to get embarrassed about it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:5=loss,Don't say things like that! You'll just encourage ~player~ more...
-1-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=surprised,D-don't put words in my mouth!
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...This is why humans shouldn't be trusted with advanced weaponry.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=annoyed,...There is no way that should have worked.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=awkward,...Well, interesting outfit at least. You look like a whole new person!
-1-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:5=awkward,Good thing I've built up a fire resistance during my adventures. N-not that I'd stare or anything.
-1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=shy,I think the set you have is just fine. I prefer comfort over flashiness any day of the week.
-1-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=smug,Sure you weren't. That's why you're taking out your frustrations here, right?
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:elaine=shy,Even with a guy like me here?
-1-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=angry,I'm not telling you anything! You don't need that gun!
-1-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:5=thinking,So that's where he went off to after the third Smash tourney.
-1-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:4=beat,Well, this got awkward fast.
-1-female_removed_major,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:6=calm,Don't get soft on us now! You're not done yet!
-1-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:6=annoyed,Fine. It's not like I wanted to stare anyway...
-1-female_removed_major,target:leela,targetStage:5=surprised,Don't look at me, ~player~. If you want that number, go ahead.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ciri,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sorry! It was subconscious, I swear!
-1-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:4=devoted,I disagree. This isn't lame at all.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=pumped,Let's fight! But, uh, don't do a helicopter kick. Wouldn't want the civilians to get hurt.
-1-female_removed_major,target:spooky,targetStage:2=annoyed,...At least ghosts can fly...
-1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=shy,It's not <i>really</i> surprising to see bindings, but it's still not something I ever see...
-1-female_removed_major,target:lara,targetStage:5=sad,That's not even really a bra... more like... bindings.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lilith,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow, that tattoo looks really detailed. Is it on... you know...
-1-female_removed_major,target:velma_classic,targetStage:4=awkward,I can't imagine why.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lux,targetStage:5=happy,Not weird at all. I live above the clouds but can't even get a decent tan!
-1-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=surprised,Why can I see your abs through your leotard? Is it that tight, or are you <i>that</i> toned?
-1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=shy,Says the woman from a nation allergic to pants.
-1-female_removed_major,target:evie,targetStage:5,marker:puns=joking,Sorry! You're just so <i>cool</i> to look at!
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=shy,It's hardly the worst thing going on at the moment...
-1-female_removed_major,target:faye,targetStage:5=stunned,Oh, really? Guess I spoke too soon. Thanks Faye!
-1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=pumped,You can do it, Florina! Just a little more!
-1-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4=beat,Babysitting? I'm so sorry.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=joking,If you ask me, this is the last thing you should be dressing up for...
-1-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:4=sad,So you weren't from the start? How... disappointing.
-1-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5=awkward,Maybe I should be glad I don't wear long pants.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=shy,I didn't think pirates were the type to wear garter belts...
-1-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=shy,You've certainly got the tanlines of a beachgoer.
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,That must've been uncomfortable, holding it there for so long. Or did you... never mind.
-1-female_removed_major,target:kurumu,targetStage:5=annoyed,*grumble*
-1-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:3=stunned,Nice trick! But, uh... I hope you have a back-up shirt of some kind.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=thinking,I never would have guessed she was... never mind.
-1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=thinking,I mean, a real lady wouldn't even touch this game, am I right?
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=pumped,Heh. I may be a beginner, but I'm blessed by Lady Palutena herself! Even if you had ten more layers, no way I'd lose!
-1-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=smug,Oh, I see. Then why are you blushing?
-1-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:3=awkward,Science wins again!
-1-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6=shy,I've, uh, noticed.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=sad,But the mask added so much to your character...
-1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh! You know Lyn? I never took her as the laundry type.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Hoo boy. Pressure.
-1-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=sad,Oh, I was wrong? Coulda sworn you were matching.
-1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:5=shy,That looks kind of drab. I mean, compared to the rest of you.
-1-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=shy,Well... it's certainly a good look on you...
-1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:6=sad,(She's totally not fine.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:tina,targetStage:5=surprised,More like Tina Legstrong.
-1-female_removed_major,target:korra,targetStage:6=shy,It's not so bad. I'm pretty much always showing my underwear, and I'm fine...mostly.
-1-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=awkward,The answer is too many.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jane,targetStage:4=beat,I'll just look elsewhere before I make a fool of myself.
-1-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=shy,I-I've never really been a big fan of oversized shirts, but you really make it look good...
-1-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=calm,(I admire her commitment to the game.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=stunned,Whoa! A scar? That looks pretty cool, not gonna lie.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,(I think I'll keep to myself that I think they're both cute.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:6=awkward,Heh. No item duplication glitches here, Princess.
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=surprised,You've got to be kidding me. There really was a foot fetishist here?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,Just let her do her own thing. No use arguing with a drunk.
-1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:tina=happy,Sounds like a good idea! You should go, Saki!
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,What a cold thing to say to a friend...
-1-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:5=victory,<i>But we musn't be careless.</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Listen to your sister, Ruby. It's probably best if you don't see her butt.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Well, first of all, you're a bluenette too, Sei.
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:blake=thinking,BB? ...Oh! Blake Belladonna!
-1-female_removed_major,target:tracer,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=happy,Yep. Legs of a runner. Falcon seems to agree, too!
-1-female_removed_major,target:yang,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:neo=beat,Trust me, she doesn't make it easy for me either. Look at her. All mute and stuff.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. Even she can fly?
-1-female_removed_major,target:sharla,targetStage:4=joking,<i>Le's not lose our 'eads though!</i>
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=thinking,I... don't think there's much risk of that here.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-yang:1=beat,Glad I don't have any siblings... unless you count Pittoo.
-1-female_removed_major,target:weiss_v4,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
-1-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=victory,Something tells me Spring Break isn't a big priority in your world.
-1-female_removed_major,target:weiss,targetStage:4,count-weiss_v4:1=embarrassed,W-Whoa, you really weren't kidding when you said "sexy"!
-1-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,count-weiss:1=shy,That's what I thought.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4,totalMales:4=shy,Say that's not a... oh. It is.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5,totalMales:4=embarrassed,No! Not at all!
-1-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:5=smug,Did it really have to go? Did it, Shazza?
-1-female_removed_major,target:pauling,targetStage:5,totalMasturbating:1-4=beat,Sure, keep on wishing it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6,totalNaked:1-4=angry,You should have suggested that earlier! Y'know, <i>before the body parts came out</i>.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4,totalExposed:1-4=awkward,We've been in "magic mode" for some time now.
-1-female_removed_major,target:alpha,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,Maybe you should turn that off, Streaming-chan. I don't think Alpha's too happy right now.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=loss,Trust me. You don't want to see Corrin's transformation.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy=awkward,You're right about that. I'd like to get some magic trinkets to wear at some point myself.
-1-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:5=devoted,Okay, Ms. Prefect.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:videl=victory,Whatever floats your boat. I like my tunic, personally.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,What a weird dream to have.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,In case you haven't heard, demonic powers are prohibited by order of Lady Palutena!
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:captain_america=shy,What about Skyworld men? Because I haven't seen a naked woman before tonight.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,Is that meant to be sarcastic?
-1-female_removed_major,target:piper,targetStage:7=embarrassed,Please, cover yourself!
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Ah, come on! You know you love my puns!
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,Maybe I should learn French. It'd give me something to do in these days of peace.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,Is this what it's like to flirt? Maybe I should be glad I don't have a girlfriend...
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:gwen=surprised,What? Nonononono! I mean, I love Lady Palutena, but, you know, platonically! As a friend!
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:korra=shy,I take it there's no room for a guy hero in this pity party?
-1-female_removed_major,target:april,targetStage:5=awkward,(I'm half tempted to eat pizza shirtless next time.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:willow,targetStage:3=beat,That's probably true. That top doesn't look super revealing or anything.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,Fashion. Just another thing I'm hopelessly inept at.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:nagisa=happy,I'm glad my opponents turned out to be super nice. I should've known better than to doubt Lady Palutena about this.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:mei=devoted,Blue is such a nice color, isn't it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,(Psst... ~player~... don't look now, but I think the Ladybug is getting pretty chummy with the Spider.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:penny,targetStage:4=surprised,Y-yes, understood.
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=annoyed,Stupid contractual obligations...
-1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:marinette=pumped,Now I have something to look forward too! Don't mess this up, Marinette!
-1-female_removed_major,target:hermione,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Gonna have to agree with Hermione there.
-1-female_removed_major,target:hope,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=stunned,You two know each other? And I never pegged you as the laundry type, Lyn.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:mia=awkward,What's a dango? Sounds like a cute pet.
-1-female_removed_major,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:5=shy,Good how?
-1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,(I feel bad for Chun-Li. Juri's probably gonna be harassing her all night...)
-1-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stunned,A backroom deal? ...Do I have any say in this?
-1-female_removed_major,target:lyn,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Do you... not wear underwear sometimes, Florina?
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:aimee=shy,I'm fine with this, personally. (Draw it out as much as possible.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:wicking=beat,Got to admit, that just seems like a waste of money.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=awkward,Oh yeah. Guess that footage is going to be a problem, huh?
-1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=awkward,Bit softer-looking than I was expecting. Not that that's a bad thing.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=beat,She's gone. Just straight up gone.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:4=shy,(I dunno why, but themed panties like that make me happy.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:5=pumped,Without your attorney's badge, you're just another player here! Let's go!
-1-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:5=stunned,Have you been taking it easy on me? By all means, go all out!
-1-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:5=beat,I was right, but this was maybe a little less exciting than I hoped.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=beat,Okaaaaay. This is no worse than a two-stage boss. Plus, this form seems weaker.
-1-female_removed_major,target:videl,targetStage:4=thinking,Pretty standard, I think. From the looks of it, my bottoms are made of the same material.
-1-female_removed_major,target:calisto,targetStage:6=joking,Maybe you should've asked that bald judge. Clearly, he'd make a better decision than any of us.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:6=devoted,If you <i>did</i> do something bad, Lady Palutena would be merciless in her punishment.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sonya,targetStage:5=angry,What's you thoughts on this, ~player~? ...Oh come on! You're just going to say nothing and let her walk all over you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=awkward,That's training gear? I think it works.
-1-female_removed_major,target:ayano,targetStage:5=thinking,You've got a little watermelon on your swimsuit. (That is watermelon, right?)
-1-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:4=shy,It doesn't look any worse than a one-piece swimsuit from here, at least.
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:warmth=shy,Hot's putting it mildly.
-1-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:6=shy,(Guess the joke is on me... I'm probably more uncomfortable than she is.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:aella,targetStage:4=smug,Would you rather choose the other option? Or is that a bit too daring for you?
-1-female_removed_major,target:mercy,targetStage:3=happy,This is still a battle. Just with less guns. And clothes. And questionably more banter.
-1-female_removed_major,target:may,targetStage:6=beat,Depends on your definition of happy...
-1-female_removed_major,target:mia,targetStage:4=sad,Mia!
-1-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:5=pumped,You don't scare me! ...Still gonna look away, though.
-1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You certainly... fill it out well.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:6=shy,I think those panties suit you. (Is that really all you can say in this instance, Pit?)
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Are you teasing us?
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=beat,(Ah... she's wearing a thong? I better not stare at it.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:6=shy,That sounds nice. Can we just do that instead? Please?
-1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:5=shy,Sorry. I hope I wasn't literally drooling there.
-1-female_removed_major,target:black_canary,targetStage:5=joking,To be fair, I live in a world where sports bras are less plentiful than aliens.
-1-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:5=shy,(She has a point, but it's still tough to look away.)
-1-female_removed_major,target:seven,targetStage:2=shy,Sorry, I just wasn't expecting you to be so toned, is all.
-1-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=shy,I wholeheartedly agree.
-1-female_removed_major,target:zelda,targetStage:5=shy,(This <i>is</i> a rare opportunity. I just wish I knew what to say in times like these!)
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:support=shy,Not wearing your green one today? Uh, don't... ask why I know that.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage1=awkward,Wow. That ran out faster than my Power of Flight!
-1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:appropriate=beat,That's probably true. Although this doesn't seem very intensive.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:pearl=joking,Think you still have some things to learn about magic.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:6=stunned,Wow. Should I be ashamed that a human paramedic has more abs than me?
-1-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I'm sorry! I promise I won't look!
-1-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=shy,Good thing your shirt is pretty thick, huh?
-1-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=happy,Ah, but with you and me around, this is already a magic game.
-1-female_removed_major,target:shazza,targetStage:4,marker:palutenacall=thinking,Have you considered asking Lady Palutena for the answer?
-1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=shy,Don't worry. I'll make sure it won't leave this room.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=beat,Hey, me too! Guess we can... admire each other's legs, or something.
-1-female_removed_major,target:harley,targetStage:5=thinking,On a semi-related note, how did you paint your whole body like that? Did you get help or...
-1-female_removed_major,target:chell,targetStage:2=beat,...It's tough to make conversation like this.
-1-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:6=joking,To be fair, who does like pants?
-1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=sad,Oh, phew. For a while, I thought you weren't wearing anything under there.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:5=shy,No, please, keep talking! (I think it's... kind of cute...)
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheena_classic,targetStage:5=awkward,Must not be a very good pervert then.
-1-female_removed_major,target:chara,targetStage:4=annoyed,Wow, no respect for the human soul... you're as bad as Hades.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marceline,targetStage:5=thinking,Are you grabbing an invisible pole? Like Lady Palutena's favorite taunt?
-1-female_removed_major,target:blackrose,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Was I drooling? Sorry, I was daydreaming earlier.

male_chest_will_be_visible=awkward,Ah, ~name~'s gonna show off finally.
male_chest_is_visible=smug,I wouldn't say it's a big deal. Guys go around shirtless all the time in the human cities.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=pumped,Guess who's finally showing it to us? Hint: it's not me.
male_small_crotch_is_visible=beat,No comment.
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,Hey, I think I'm around the same si-I mean, what?
male_large_crotch_is_visible=stunned,Someone took "speak soft and carry a big stick" a bit literally.
female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,Y-You're not really gonna show them, are you?
female_small_chest_is_visible=stunned,Those look... underdeveloped. Maybe Lady Palutena could give some tips?
female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking,So what was the big deal? Not that different from my own.
female_medium_chest_is_visible=devoted,I think I'm in love...
female_large_chest_is_visible=devoted,Truly Lady Palutena blessed you. Be grateful.

0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...

0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:xander=smug,This is exactly how I saw it going!
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=joking,Whatever you say, buddy.
0-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:caleb=smug,I'm sure you're well-toned enough.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.

0-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.

0-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=sad,Wish I could grow chest hair like that...
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:kira=awkward,Oh good. I thought you wouldn't speak English again.
0-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.

0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?

0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?

0-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,My thoughts exactly, Hope.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=annoyed,Please, just... make this quick...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=shy,(Ah... I just noticed the mole... it's kind of cute.)

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.

0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.

0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:faye=shy,Er, sorry. Back to card games.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:videl=shy,Videl's not wrong, you know...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:4=embarrassed,You really should've zipped.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, bigger than I thought!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Woah, they're huge!
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Sheesh... are those as big as Lady Palutena's?
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I didn't even know they could get this big on humans...
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=loss,I'm sorry! I'll try not to look at them, ~name~!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chara=shy,Me neither, Chara. Me neither.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,You didn't deny it, though...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=shy,Maybe for you. I still don't know how I'm this lucky!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Interesting take.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:hifumicomment,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,(There isn't a strip shoji too, is there?)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=annoyed,Button masher, huh...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=angry,Yes! Please! For all of us here...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:harucomment,alsoPlaying:ann=surprised,Sounds just like me.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=joking,Wow, so many puns! I'm proud of you!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,A-At least it can't get any worse for you, right?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,(At least I'm not the one being called the creep.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=shy,(Hope I don't pass off as a creep.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stunned,Well that's... I mean I... excuse me for one second.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised,Waitwaitwaitwait! At least <i>warn</i> us before you go dropping your panties immediately!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:makotocomment,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,Guess I'm the preachy one instead.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,No more jokes and no more distrations...

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=surprised,(Shoot, I'm actually really looking forward to this!)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:piper=sad,O-oh my.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. Incredible...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=shy,(Again, why couldn't that sweater be just a <i>little</i> bit longer?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,Maybe not at first, but now that you've called me that, I can't back down now!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,<i>You</i> seem to be the one issuing challenges, Rinkah!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... but I have to admit, I like the real you...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:birthday=annoyed,You're playing a dangerous game...

0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chara=surprised,Even the pubic hair? ...Are we sure she's not Hades?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerf=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. She <i>wanted</i> those.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,(Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerm=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. He <i>wanted</i> those.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=shy,It <i>is</i> really pretty... like a flower...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=awkward,(Still better than the Aurum.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jasmine=shy,O-oh, I see.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... I wonder if she styles it differently from her usual costume.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sharla=pumped,You will be soon.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=beat,So that's out there now... yep... so, uh... how's it feel?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:harley=beat,So... uh... cute grooming down there?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amy_rose=thinking,No? Well okay then. (Why do I even bother sometimes...)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,You're so pretty, ~player~... wait, I mean, it's, uh, okay I guess.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Is that normally how human girls style... down there?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,It's like opening a treasure box...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,That's.... yeah. Wow. So different from what I expected from you...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=loss,D-Do you want me to look away? This isn't something an angel should be looking at!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=shy,I sure hope you'll be okay... you don't have to put on a brave face for us, if you don't want to...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,W-well, it was messy... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=sad,Aww, but I love the booty. N-Not that booty, but...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that the moon's out.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=shy,Wow... that tattoo really covers <i>all over</i>...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=embarrassed,Nothing bad, I hope.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aiyana=embarrassed,I'll just try to pretend those tan lines are a swimsuit. Just have to avoid the finer details... like the hair....
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice=shy,S-someone pinch me...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=sad,I could never get used to fighting naked. How do you do it?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:leela=shy,Don't be hard on yourself. You're more developed than any Monoeye I ever fought!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha=embarrassed,I'm sorry! It's not like I want to look!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,Oh... now I know why it hurts so much when I get hit by Peach Bomber....
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=smug,I'm not scared of death! I beat the god of it, after all!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=surprised,Did you do this... to flirt with us? Well, uh, gotta say, it was kind of effective.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=surprised,I'm not saying anything!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,marker:puns=shy,It's, uh, how do I put this... Kyu-te.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=beat,Saki, there's no need to be so depressing. You're fine!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=joking,Those buns are toastier than I expected, actually.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=beat,You really should have worn something else... you realize you'll have to go home like that, right?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:faye=shy,I was curious if your hair matched, but... never mind.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:asuna=awkward,H-how'd you guess?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=shy,You might want to cover up. Even a little? Your... everything...is showing...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. I think that's a bit more important than Sonya's workout routine right now...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:link=smug,Oh, Link. Really?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,So, uh... go team RWBY?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=joking,Seems there's a split opinion in the literature club.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Surprise, you're both filthy!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:ragequit=7-zblank,WHY?!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=annoyed,Look at what you've done. Apologize to Ruby!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=surprised,What? For... her?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=beat,Corrin's too nice to brag. I'm sure he'll be a gentleman about this.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=angry,Don't try anything, Ice Cream. I won't go easy on you if you make me your enemy!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,You said it, not me... stop looking at me like that.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=awkward,Maybe you should've been the dancer of Corrin's army instead of that blue lady.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,How messed up are you?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.

1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...

1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!

1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.

1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheva,marker:palutenacall=thinking,I see no net.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=beat,That just sounds like filth to me...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pearl=surprised,Y-you could've warned us first!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=sad,Sorry, Natsuki... I don't want you exposing yourself any more than you do.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,(I'm really going to see Samus's chest... is this real life?)
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=angry,Really? What tipped you off?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alpha=surprised,You didn't even hesitate to strip? I'm impressed at how brave you are.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=stunned,How come? Don't be nervous, you're in good company.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=shy,But this is no laughing matter.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=shy,(A-Adorable...)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=devoted,But, uh... y-you did great! Seriously!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss=shy,(A-Adorable...)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=shy,A-again, intimidation doesn't work on me...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,Tell your viewers to watch closely! I won't lose to the likes of you!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,marker:puns=joking,Not much cleavage, is there?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sure you'll get your growth spurt some time.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=devoted,Don't be embarrassed! Even the gods can still be flat!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,There's probably a lot of perks to having them small, you know.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Don't feel bad, ~name~. They're great.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Weird to think we're almost the same chest size...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jane=embarrassed,Ahem! Yes, well, let's just move on, okay?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,Goes kind of beyond simple bonding, but sure.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=shy,So this is what an Inkling looks like...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=annoyed,You've made that extensively clear.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:sonya=annoyed,You've got some weird priorities, Sonya.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=beat,It's not bad that I'm rooting for Raven here, is it?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=awkward,More like sibling bonds, but sure.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:misty=shy,I'm not looking! Oh, what's that over there, away from Misty? Let's have a look!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=awkward,Kind of a weird idea of bonding, but sure.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:dawn=happy,Ah, covering them with your hair! Smart!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kim=shy,(A bit smaller than she looked.)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=stunned,That's not directed at me is it? I'll have you know these are one-hundred percent real clothes. Touch them if you don't believe me.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby=embarrassed,Hey, small is good! It's nice and compact.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,This is going to be an interesting forfeit...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=awkward,Ha! Called out!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=annoyed,Hmph! Thought you were clever?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ayano=pumped,Fine. I won't lose to someone like you anyway!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ryuko=surprised,It's the remaining ten percent that gets to me.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=beat,Don't put yourself down. I think they're fine. But then again, I don't really have a frame of reference...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:marceline=awkward,They kinda look unhealthy, but if you're fine...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=embarrassed,I don't really know what to say... I was never too fond of you, but... dang...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:may=shy,It's not like we asked you to do it, you know.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ciri=stunned,I think she's talking to you, ~player~.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=devoted,Hey, I'm sure ~player~ likes them, at least. And so do I...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mara_jade=shy,You really should wear underwear...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=joking,My honest answer? An eight.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,So this is the body of someone blessed by Lady Palutena...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica=smug,Are you seriously into this, ~player~? You're more twisted than I thought.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika=awkward,Something tells me our friend isn't going to give you feedback. But that look says it all, right?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blackrose=awkward,Right. Let's move on, everyone.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=beat,Do all humans act like her, ~player~? I had no idea they could be this... provocative.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=stunned,D-don't be! I think you're pretty great, y'know?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,Erp!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,I never doubted their authenticity, Buffy...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=shy,They do have a nice curvature...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:harley=awkward,(Maybe she's just really pale.)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,When you say royal treasure, I hope you mean you don't, uh, display them, if you catch my meaning.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:penny,marker:palutenacall=shy,Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake=awkward,At least it's a learning experience, even if it's harsh.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:black_canary=stunned,Now I know why the caged bird sings.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daphne=determined,(She's right again. I have to remember, she's the victim here, not me. Focus!)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:alice=embarrassed,What is that? A piercing? I was staring, wasn't I? Sorry.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=loss,That's... just wonderful.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=shy,I'm not saying that. (Though I'm also not complaining.)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:orendi=embarrassed,I'm witnessing... something.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen=shy,Erp. I don't like that look you're giving off. So full of... lust.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,I think all those drinks got to your head.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sharla=loss,<i>I'm... really feeling it?</i>
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gogo=shy,On... your back? Don't put that image in my head.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=beat,Is that a bad thing? Seriously, I don't know Australian slang.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina=devoted,I'm proud of you. Really, I am.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Yeah, not willing to challenge that.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=shy,My heart's melting now...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sheva=beat,This makes zero sense. Also, pretty sure it's cheating.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sonya=shy,T-they're not that great. So full of yourself...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=shy,Um... nice tanlines?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ami=beat,Yeah... not modest at all.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tina=angry,Boo! False advertising!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,(Now I'm the one who's frozen in time...)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:velma_classic=surprised,Probably because you're hallucinating living pictures.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,(They're so... perky...)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,Yep, you got it.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stunned,I can't believe what I'm seeing. My trainer is naked in front of me!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I've...earned this? I don't feel like I've done anything, though.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,W-Well, you've always been the most toned human I know. Seeing you completely naked like this is... well, I guess it is enjoyable.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daria=stunned,Oh, like a Boo?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,Right. N-No need to be ashamed.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,You didn't have to do that, you know...

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,Those also appear heavy.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,So much for that line of conversation.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Or is she just smitten with Chun-Li?

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:xander=thinking,(Hope my mouth wasn't open either...)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=embarrassed,Ouch. I could feel that set in from here.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kimberly=determined,I don't like it either, Kimberly. But if I can soldier through it, you can try too!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shy,And, uh, looks like you're finally getting to the "Love Fairy" stuff? ...I'm sorry, I'm bad at small talk.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=beat,That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:fred=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than maybe Mr. Big Talk over there.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=beat,Oh geez... I didn't even realize you were aiming for the top...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:shaggy=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Mr. Zoinks over there.

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:velma=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Ms. Jinkies, I mean.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=thinking,Are cool mouth noises all it takes to make something sci-fi? ...This changes everything.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gods,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,I think it does please Lady Palutena, even if she'd never admit it.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Amazing... that's all I can say, ~player~.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,They... suit you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I might've taken a few peeks. Sorry.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Woah... they look even bigger than I imagined. N-Not that I was imagining them!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=determined,They're very nice. ...Uh, right. Next hand.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gym,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,There's a reason tunics are the clothing of choice for humans.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=surprised,Oh. That's bad.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,I mean, I'll take your word for it... but you don't seem very hopeful.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3=determined,You got it... sorry about your bra, though.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:olympics,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=awkward,They still have nude olymics in my world! Magnus is a great wrestler, by the way.

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:ann=awkward,All I can say is sorry. Ahaha...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:angie=thinking,Those are nothing like Corrin's... those are more like... who does she talk about? Camilla?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=embarrassed,Please tell me I don't have to do any of that.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:aiyana=beat,As long as you're happy. But man, this is going to be awkward...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:asuna=surprised,I promised I wouldn't stare, so I won't. Even if I am curious...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=beat,Maybe just... don't say anything... again.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=beat,Bit of a stretch, I know. But I <i>had</i> to say it!

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Can't really say... after all I just met you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,They both sound like pieces of work.

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,I... uh... those are... kinda distracting.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=shy,I get you're trying to be nice, but maybe Twilight should choose someone else to help.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, bigger than I thought!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Woah, they're huge!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Sheesh... are those as big as Lady Palutena's?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I didn't even know they could get this big on humans...

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,That was a cheap trick...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I don't think wrestlers are supposed to act so calmly to being nearly naked...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=beat,Sorry. My eyes tend to wander.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=beat,(It's like all her bluster drained away the minute she started losing. Still, it was worth the wait.)

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:web=surprised,Has that... ever happened before, or are you just making it up?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=happy,Huh? Bought what?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led him on!

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=embarrassed,Stop teasing us, Neo... please...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,...Ruby?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Interesting take.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,I can completely understand tradition. But do they all come so small?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=joking,Oh no, I'm not hating! It's just that there's already so much out in the open...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=surprised,I was just surprised by how much you were showing off. I'm not hating.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=determined,Deep breaths, Natsuki. (And you too, Pit...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tina=awkward,Ah, you don't need 'em. The game industry is where it's at!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,If there's one good thing to come out of tonight, I'm going to make Cloud super jealous!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=stunned,You did <i>what</i> to it? That just seems... wrong!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:penny=determined,Okay! I swear, I won't look again!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=annoyed,The sex demon's getting naked? Who could've seen this coming?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:monika=devoted,The last piece... the final hit!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=beat,(I wonder if Ryu ever wanted to see this much of Chun-Li...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou=beat,You <i>really</i> don't want to use the amulet? O-okay then.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=beat,Your lack of shame baffles me.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,No more jokes and no more distrations...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=surprised,(Shoot, I'm actually really looking forward to this!)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,I'll pass... maybe ~player~ would like to help, though.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chica=joking,It could've fooled me...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=sad,Uh oh. This is gonna be messy.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Wait, why is Nadeshiko naked too?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sonya=happy,You wanna finish that sentence?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:piper=sad,O-oh my.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=calm,There we go, finally almost got you!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Yep. So far gone, she's probably in Skyworld.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mileena=beat,*sigh* Great...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=determined,Just remember, it's not over yet. Stay strong.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=beat,I feel bad for stripping such a nice girl... but it's the game, y'know...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shazza=joking,Can it really be called a morsel with how much it's covering?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby=loss,This is definitely happening... just don't think about it too hard...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sharla=beat,Oh, right. Being naked is an actual strategy in your world.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elena=sad,I wish you'd get your deus ex machina, but not even Lady Palutena could help you now.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=shy,I can hardly believe this myself, Elaine... Is that a tattoo?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang=smug,I know a thing or two about overconfidence. <i>You</i> were overconfident.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm sorry, but...I'm sure you can do it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zelda=shy,H-Hang on, I need to get ready.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=surprised,Is this a new feeling for you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=shy,They are a bit... um... distracting...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=shy,M-Maybe there'll be triple pants?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chara=shy,Me neither, Chara. Me neither.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ayano=embarrassed,(Don't let it be me, don't let it be me, don't let it be me...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=angry,Don't try anything, Ice Cream. I won't go easy on you if you make me your enemy!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=shy,I sure hope you'll be okay... you don't have to put on a brave face for us, if you don't want to...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,You said it, not me... stop looking at me like that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,How messed up are you?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,You're so pretty, ~player~... wait, I mean, it's, uh, okay I guess.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Is that normally how human girls style... down there?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,It's like opening a treasure box...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,That's.... yeah. Wow. So different from what I expected from you...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=loss,D-Do you want me to look away? This isn't something an angel should be looking at!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,Sorry I can't help much with that. I'm no Cupid...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:beatrix=awkward,Doesn't mean much when you're divine, either.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=sad,Aww, but I love the booty. N-Not that booty, but...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:jasmine=shy,G-Good on ya, DMG.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that the moon's out.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=surprised,What? For... her?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,(Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,W-well, it was messy... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=surprised,(These two would make a weird team.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,C-Cruel? What have I done?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,Maybe not at first, but now that you've called me that, I can't back down now!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,<i>You</i> seem to be the one issuing challenges, Rinkah!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:leela=shy,Don't be hard on yourself. You're more developed than any Monoeye I ever fought!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:hermione=beat,You're a pretty powerful magician yourself, Zelda. And it's against the rules, anyway.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=sad,I could never get used to fighting naked. How do you do it?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:zoey=embarrassed,Don't shame her, Zoey. A-And that's not something you should be admitting so lightly!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:link=smug,Oh, Link. Really?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. Incredible...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice=shy,S-someone pinch me...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=joking,Seems there's a split opinion in the literature club.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aiyana=embarrassed,I'll just try to pretend those tan lines are a swimsuit. Just have to avoid the finer details... like the hair....
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Surprise, you're both filthy!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Say, Lady Palutena, would my hair turn gold if I had light powers too?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=shy,Wow... that tattoo really covers <i>all over</i>...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,Look at what you've done. Did you really have to humiliate Yang like that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=annoyed,Look at what you've done. Apologize to Ruby!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=embarrassed,Nothing bad, I hope.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I doubt that beam's very warm. But what do I know?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=pumped,You want to take out Lady Palutena, you have to get through me first!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=shy,It <i>is</i> really pretty... like a flower...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jasmine=shy,O-oh, I see.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:jane,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,P-please don't do any spanking in here. It's bad enough you're naked!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... I wonder if she styles it differently from her usual costume.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sharla=pumped,You will be soon.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=awkward,And you probably shouldn't.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=stunned,R-really? Is that all it takes to be considered mature in your world?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,Okay, seriously, how do you expect us to play with... <i>this</i> going on?!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Point is, everything's broken.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=embarrassed,Y-You didn't shave for someone here, did you?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Phew... I wasn't the only one bothered by her.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha=embarrassed,I'm sorry! It's not like I want to look!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=happy,I'm hopping on the Ladybottom train too!... N-not in <i>that</i> way, but... you know what I mean...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:asuna=awkward,H-how'd you guess?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerm=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. He <i>wanted</i> those.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=beat,Saki, there's no need to be so depressing. You're fine!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=shy,(Again, why couldn't that sweater be just a <i>little</i> bit longer?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:birthday=annoyed,You're playing a dangerous game...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerf=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. She <i>wanted</i> those.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,At least it was just an illusion.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,totalMales:4=beat,What, you don't like being the only girl?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=awkward,(Still better than the Aurum.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. I think that's a bit more important than Sonya's workout routine right now...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=beat,So that's out there now... yep... so, uh... how's it feel?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=beat,Corrin's too nice to brag. I'm sure he'll be a gentleman about this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=awkward,Maybe you should've been the dancer of Corrin's army instead of that blue lady.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,...Blake?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,I wouldn't trust her not to brag. She gets preeeetty competitive.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,So, uh... go team RWBY?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,Oh... now I know why it hurts so much when I get hit by Peach Bomber....
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shy,Magic...?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amy_rose=thinking,No? Well okay then. (Why do I even bother sometimes...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=shy,Y'know, surrounded by all these guys, this is a bresh of freath-er, breath of fresh air. Doesn't even feel <i>completely</i> awkward.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:3-4=embarrassed,D-don't remind me...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=surprised,Go team...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chara=surprised,Even the pubic hair? ...Are we sure she's not Hades?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=beat,Well, someone out their has their birthday on Valentine's.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:ragequit=7-zblank,WHY?!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=shy,So that's your little sister...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=shy,You might want to cover up. Even a little? Your... everything...is showing...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,marker:puns=shy,It's, uh, how do I put this... Kyu-te.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... but I have to admit, I like the real you...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=surprised,Did you do this... to flirt with us? Well, uh, gotta say, it was kind of effective.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=joking,Those buns are toastier than I expected, actually.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=embarrassed,Y-Yeah, save it for another time, please!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=smug,I'm not scared of death! I beat the god of it, after all!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=joking,Hey now! We're <i>all</i> weird, Futaba.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:harley=beat,So... uh... cute grooming down there?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,It is a bit of an eyecatcher, huh?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=surprised,I didn't say that! I didn't say anything, actually.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=beat,You really should have worn something else... you realize you'll have to go home like that, right?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:faye=shy,I was curious if your hair matched, but... never mind.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,T-That's a bit too much info!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=embarrassed,I kind of have a similar style... I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> poking, whatever that means.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.


#lost sash
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=pumped,Isn't <i>this</i> fantastic? I won't tell Nintendo, but you better believe I'm telling everyone back home!
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:caleb=smug,I'm sure you're well-toned enough.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=joking,Whatever you say, buddy.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:xander=smug,This is exactly how I saw it going!
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=smug,Oh, you're comfortable with this, are you?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=surprised,Oh! The shirt now?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:kira=thinking,(What is he saying?)
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:xander=sad,If only I had your confidence.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=happy,Impressive! I'm still working on getting a set myself.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=sad,Wish I could grow chest hair like that...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred,totalFemales:1-3=awkward,All these pretty ladies judging you?
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:kira=awkward,Oh good. I thought you wouldn't speak English again.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=happy,You ever go to the hot springs? Surely you've used them before.
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:xander=awkward,Sorry, as someone who's beaten Donkey Kong many times, I can't relate.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kira=awkward,Guess we're in the same boat there.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:launch=shy,Sheesh, so aggressive...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ayano=angry,Cheater!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,(Should we give them a nice warm welcome?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=stunned,A picture? Where?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=angry,Really? What tipped you off?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I'll, uh, pass. W-why don't you go help, ~player~?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meg=angry,I already told you, didn't I? I don't judge!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:paya=shy,No... hard... feelings?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,Hahaha~! ~player~ got busted!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang=shy,Well, only since you've been hyping it up all game...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=beat,That just sounds like filth to me...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=pumped,Don't worry! I don't think you'll disappoint.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=shy,(Poor Nagisa looks like she's about to burst into tears...)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,Do you really have to do it so slow? It's killing me...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,No way... Lady Palutena?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=pumped,Time to demask this heroine!
2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=annoyed,Please, just... make this quick...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=beat,Look, I laugh about a lot of things...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=loss,All of a sudden?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chara=surprised,Maybe you don't, but I do!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chell=embarrassed,Really? The undershirt before the jumpsuit?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=surprised,C-Cool? But your, uh, b-boobs are...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=shy,(Ah... I just noticed the mole... it's kind of cute.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=stunned,Yes, of course! You won't hear a a peep out of me.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sonya=smug,Not so tough, are you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:may=loss,Urgh...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,My thoughts exactly, Hope.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alpha=surprised,You didn't even hesitate to strip? I'm impressed at how brave you are.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheva,marker:palutenacall=thinking,I see no net.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,Why would you even mention that...?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lilith=beat,Getting pretty intense here. There are a ton of <i>Sirens</i> going off in my head.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=beat,(Hope Viridi never catches wind of this. She'd smite Morrigan herself.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=thinking,You kinda lost me.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pearl=surprised,Y-you could've warned us first!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:leela=beat,Lucky them, I guess?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lux=shy,Well, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually really curious what Lux has.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou=surprised,Wait, you still have that amulet-
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:asuna=thinking,(Is this a regular thing with prisoners?...<i>Did this happen with Lady Palutena?</i>)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=sad,Sorry, Natsuki... I don't want you exposing yourself any more than you do.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tina=shy,A-are they really that great?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:peach=sad,I think I'm feeling a little nervous...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,(I'm really going to see Samus's chest... is this real life?)
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma=shy,Just out of curiosity, why <i>are</i> you not wearing anything under there?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:sonya=annoyed,You've got some weird priorities, Sonya.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,Tell your viewers to watch closely! I won't lose to the likes of you!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=awkward,Kind of a weird idea of bonding, but sure.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=awkward,More like sibling bonds, but sure.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss=shy,(A-Adorable...)
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=devoted,But, uh... y-you did great! Seriously!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=awkward,Ha! Called out!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=shy,(A-Adorable...)
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=shy,But this is no laughing matter.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,This is going to be an interesting forfeit...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,Goes kind of beyond simple bonding, but sure.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=stunned,How come? Don't be nervous, you're in good company.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=stunned,That's not directed at me is it? I'll have you know these are one-hundred percent real clothes. Touch them if you don't believe me.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jane=embarrassed,Ahem! Yes, well, let's just move on, okay?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=shy,A-again, intimidation doesn't work on me...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=annoyed,You've made that extensively clear.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sure you'll get your growth spurt some time.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=devoted,Don't be embarrassed! Even the gods can still be flat!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,There's probably a lot of perks to having them small, you know.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Don't feel bad, ~name~. They're great.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Weird to think we're almost the same chest size...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:dawn=happy,Ah, covering them with your hair! Smart!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:misty=shy,I'm not looking! Oh, what's that over there, away from Misty? Let's have a look!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=shy,So this is what an Inkling looks like...
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kim=shy,(A bit smaller than she looked.)
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,marker:puns=joking,Not much cleavage, is there?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=annoyed,Hmph! Thought you were clever?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby=embarrassed,Hey, small is good! It's nice and compact.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=beat,It's not bad that I'm rooting for Raven here, is it?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:9=stunned,F-freckles?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,Erp!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=annoyed,Don't worry about her, Hope. She's everything you should <i>never</i> want to be.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=annoyed,Both of you are terrible human beings.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,As much as I like rhyming, it's not helping.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=stunned,D-don't be! I think you're pretty great, y'know?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:penny,marker:palutenacall=shy,Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=shy,They do have a nice curvature...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:xander=thinking,(Hope my mouth wasn't open either...)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=beat,Do all humans act like her, ~player~? I had no idea they could be this... provocative.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,When you say royal treasure, I hope you mean you don't, uh, display them, if you catch my meaning.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=embarrassed,Ouch. I could feel that set in from here.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=surprised,Again. Wow.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=loss,I'm just gonna look at your tattoo instead, if that's okay.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,You look flustered, Weiss. Did you know her?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,...I have no words.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=shy,This was a bit of a surprise...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Huh? Oh... forget I said anything.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:harley=awkward,(Maybe she's just really pale.)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica,alsoPlaying:orendi=sad,Sweet Lady Palutena, save me...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=surprised,Not even a little shy, huh...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=shy,Um... nice tanlines?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:orendi=embarrassed,I'm witnessing... something.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen=shy,Erp. I don't like that look you're giving off. So full of... lust.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=beat,That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gogo=shy,On... your back? Don't put that image in my head.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina=devoted,I'm proud of you. Really, I am.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=awkward,She's a bit busy at the moment. She has her own hands.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=shy,My heart's melting now...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ami=beat,Yeah... not modest at all.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=devoted,Hey, I'm sure ~player~ likes them, at least. And so do I...
2-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=sad,(She has a point... am I pervert for coming here?)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amy_rose=embarrassed,(Me too... mostly from how surprisingly human she looks.)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,(They're so... perky...)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,Yep, you got it.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:velma=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Ms. Jinkies, I mean.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=surprised,Oh. That's bad.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Wait, so you're actually <i>not</i> with the Forces of Nature? I've made a grave miscalculation... I'm so sorry, Amalia.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daria=stunned,Oh, like a Boo?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,Those also appear heavy.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,You didn't have to do that, you know...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:samus=embarrassed,They are... they really are...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,I think all those drinks got to your head.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3=determined,You got it... sorry about your bra, though.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,Right. N-No need to be ashamed.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,Meia has a point. Don't slack on staying fit!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:fred=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than maybe Mr. Big Talk over there.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I've...earned this? I don't feel like I've done anything, though.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,W-Well, you've always been the most toned human I know. Seeing you completely naked like this is... well, I guess it is enjoyable.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stunned,I can't believe what I'm seeing. My trainer is naked in front of me!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:velma_classic=surprised,Probably because you're hallucinating living pictures.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:daphne=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than the fashionista over there.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,(Now I'm the one who's frozen in time...)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zoey=beat,S-Same...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,totalExposed:1=calm,Don't worry Florina, the rest of us will be as exposed as you soon enough.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tina=angry,Boo! False advertising!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru. But they look great!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sonya=shy,T-they're not that great. So full of yourself...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sheva=beat,This makes zero sense. Also, pretty sure it's cheating.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Yeah, not willing to challenge that.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:shaggy=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Mr. Zoinks over there.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=loss,That's... just wonderful.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=beat,Is that a bad thing? Seriously, I don't know Australian slang.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,No need to be so modest, Saki! You're <i>fine.</i>

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daphne=determined,(She's right again. I have to remember, she's the victim here, not me. Focus!)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=beat,Oh geez... I didn't even realize you were aiming for the top...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=shy,You wouldn't think a criminal- who's probably wanted- would want to show off so much...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,Freckles?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Amazing... that's all I can say, ~player~.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,They... suit you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I might've taken a few peeks. Sorry.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Woah... they look even bigger than I imagined. N-Not that I was imagining them!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=determined,They're very nice. ...Uh, right. Next hand.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,I mean, I'll take your word for it... but you don't seem very hopeful.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:gwen=happy,Isn't making friends such a wonderful feeling?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,So much for that line of conversation.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=pumped,Now you know better. That on its own could be a win!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hermione=surprised,I know! I defeated Hades for... this!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=beat,Don't put yourself down. I think they're fine. But then again, I don't really have a frame of reference...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lara=stunned,Hey, those aren't polygonal at all!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gym,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,There's a reason tunics are the clothing of choice for humans.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Or is she just smitten with Chun-Li?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shy,And, uh, looks like you're finally getting to the "Love Fairy" stuff? ...I'm sorry, I'm bad at small talk.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_food_motivation=awkward,N-not at all! But on an unrelated note, anyone know any good restaurants around here?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kimberly=determined,I don't like it either, Kimberly. But if I can soldier through it, you can try too!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=awkward,I'm impressed you managed to get the chest as big as Yang's before.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=joking,My honest answer? An eight.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika=awkward,Something tells me our friend isn't going to give you feedback. But that look says it all, right?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Make sure you give her lots of support, Lyn.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,Wow... they look as soft as that pillow that follows you around.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:may=shy,It's not like we asked you to do it, you know.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:alice=embarrassed,What is that? A piercing? I was staring, wasn't I? Sorry.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jasmine=embarrassed,You're not the only thing that's been loose.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=surprised,Okay, okay! I'm sorry...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=shy,(She looks really cute in a over-the-shoulders pose.)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ryuko=surprised,It's the remaining ten percent that gets to me.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,So this is the body of someone blessed by Lady Palutena...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ayano=pumped,Fine. I won't lose to someone like you anyway!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=surprised,Well that was... weird...

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=shy,Oh... I guess you need more practice, Joey.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gods,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,I think it does please Lady Palutena, even if she'd never admit it.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ciri=stunned,I think she's talking to you, ~player~.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:black_canary=stunned,Now I know why the caged bird sings.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mara_jade=shy,You really should wear underwear...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica=smug,Are you seriously into this, ~player~? You're more twisted than I thought.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Well, that jacket was pretty bulky...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blackrose=awkward,Right. Let's move on, everyone.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,I never doubted their authenticity, Buffy...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=annoyed,You're all getting on my nerves, actually.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:marceline=awkward,They kinda look unhealthy, but if you're fine...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=thinking,Are cool mouth noises all it takes to make something sci-fi? ...This changes everything.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake=awkward,At least it's a learning experience, even if it's harsh.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Oh... she's back to normal.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=shy,I'm not saying that. (Though I'm also not complaining.)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=surprised,Aren't you a heroine, Raven? Resist!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I don't think wrestlers are supposed to act so calmly to being nearly naked...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,That's... actually a pretty good shave job. Geez...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=stunned,Plus...Ultra? That sounds cool. Wonder if I should make myself a catchy... catch-phrase too.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=shy,I wish everyone here used the hand bra... (and I still want to see that monkey.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=shy,You're just gonna laugh it off?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:faye=shy,Er, sorry. Back to card games.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=embarrassed,T-tatas sound delicious... wait, I didn't mean it like that!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:ann=awkward,All I can say is sorry. Ahaha...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:angie=thinking,Those are nothing like Corrin's... those are more like... who does she talk about? Camilla?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=embarrassed,Please tell me I don't have to do any of that.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:aiyana=beat,As long as you're happy. But man, this is going to be awkward...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:asuna=surprised,I promised I wouldn't stare, so I won't. Even if I am curious...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li=smug,I was hoping you'd still be able to fight. Let's keep going.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=beat,Bit of a stretch, I know. But I <i>had</i> to say it!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa,saidMarker:playerm=shy,(I really can't blame him, though.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa,saidMarker:playerf=shy,(I really can't blame her, though.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:4=embarrassed,You really should've zipped.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:sonya=pumped,Good. I want to see the famous Fey and Co. Turnabout!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:videl=shy,Videl's not wrong, you know...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shy,You both do. Er, was that too rude of me?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,They both sound like pieces of work.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=devoted,If  it makes you feel any better, you haven't lost when it counts.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Poor girl's having her reality crushed.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=annoyed,What are you so happy about, Ice Cream?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=sad,This is so confusing. Whose Corrin is whose?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Can't really say... after all I just met you.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=beat,Maybe just... don't say anything... again.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:pyrrha=embarrassed,That was a corset? I-I wasn't prepared! S-Sorry...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, bigger than I thought!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Woah, they're huge!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Sheesh... are those as big as Lady Palutena's?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I didn't even know they could get this big on humans...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=loss,I'm sorry! I'll try not to look at them, ~name~!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=surprised,Okay, okay! I didn't even really look!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,You get hotspring buddies in your world? (Lucky...)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya=awkward,I'm sure they would say they are great.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=embarrassed,I-it's fine! You <i>really</i> don't have to give us a dance right now!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=beat,Sorry. My eyes tend to wander.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mileena=annoyed,I don't stare! And I don't <i>want</i> to stare at someone like you!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:morrigan=annoyed,Shut up and keep playing.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=shy,(Good thing too.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Oh, Mama Mia...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,You wouldn't want to know what I think. Don't mind me, just an angel who has no idea what he's doing...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:navi=stunned,Wow, so blue.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mei=surprised,(Those are way bigger than that coat would have you think.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=beat,(It's like all her bluster drained away the minute she started losing. Still, it was worth the wait.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,That was a cheap trick...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:lilith=surprised,Are those piercings? Ouch...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:misato=shy,(Just look at the sweet scar, Pit. Don't let her intimidate you.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa=shy,(I really can't blame them, though.)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Ah... so you were telling the truth. I'm... sorry for doubting you.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,I... uh... those are... kinda distracting.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=shy,I get you're trying to be nice, but maybe Twilight should choose someone else to help.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:launch=smug,(Not so tough without your gun, are you?)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stunned,Oh! Uh... do you want me to help you find them?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,I'll keep my opinion to myself.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:leela=victory,And now me. And ~player~. And the Dealer. And so forth.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sonya=happy,You wanna finish that sentence?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Wait, why is Nadeshiko naked too?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=sad,Uh oh. This is gonna be messy.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=surprised,(Shoot, I'm actually really looking forward to this!)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:piper=sad,O-oh my.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=beat,Your lack of shame baffles me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=beat,(I wonder if Ryu ever wanted to see this much of Chun-Li...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:penny=determined,Okay! I swear, I won't look again!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,If there's one good thing to come out of tonight, I'm going to make Cloud super jealous!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tina=awkward,Ah, you don't need 'em. The game industry is where it's at!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Yep. So far gone, she's probably in Skyworld.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,I can completely understand tradition. But do they all come so small?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=joking,Oh no, I'm not hating! It's just that there's already so much out in the open...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=surprised,I was just surprised by how much you were showing off. I'm not hating.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,No more jokes and no more distrations...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ayano=embarrassed,(Don't let it be me, don't let it be me, don't let it be me...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=awkward,Hey, I warned you, Lady Palutena.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=shy,They are a bit... um... distracting...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=shy,M-Maybe there'll be triple pants?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=surprised,Is this a new feeling for you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby=loss,This is definitely happening... just don't think about it too hard...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=annoyed,The sex demon's getting naked? Who could've seen this coming?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:monika=devoted,The last piece... the final hit!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,I'll pass... maybe ~player~ would like to help, though.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chica=joking,It could've fooled me...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=joking,Wow, so many puns! I'm proud of you!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chara=shy,Me neither, Chara. Me neither.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=stunned,You did <i>what</i> to it? That just seems... wrong!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou=beat,You <i>really</i> don't want to use the amulet? O-okay then.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm sorry, but...I'm sure you can do it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=shy,I can hardly believe this myself, Elaine... Is that a tattoo?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elena=sad,I wish you'd get your deus ex machina, but not even Lady Palutena could help you now.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sharla=beat,Oh, right. Being naked is an actual strategy in your world.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shazza=joking,Can it really be called a morsel with how much it's covering?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=determined,Deep breaths, Natsuki. (And you too, Pit...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=determined,Just remember, it's not over yet. Stay strong.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mileena=beat,*sigh* Great...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:peach=beat,Prepare yourself, Pit. Here comes Peach's... peach.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=beat,I feel bad for stripping such a nice girl... but it's the game, y'know...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang=smug,I know a thing or two about overconfidence. <i>You</i> were overconfident.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zelda=shy,H-Hang on, I need to get ready.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=calm,There we go, finally almost got you!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:harucomment,alsoPlaying:ann=surprised,Sounds just like me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,I-It's a bit late for that advice at this point...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=surprised,Oh yeah... she said said she doesn't wear panties...

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:makotocomment,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,Guess I'm the preachy one instead.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Lady Palutena isn't your personal razor, you know!

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:8=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,T-That's a bit too much info!

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=embarrassed,I kind of have a similar style... I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> poking, whatever that means.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:beatrix=awkward,Doesn't mean much when you're divine, either.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,I wouldn't trust her not to brag. She gets preeeetty competitive.

2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I doubt that beam's very warm. But what do I know?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:3-4=embarrassed,D-don't remind me...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=pumped,You want to take out Lady Palutena, you have to get through me first!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=shy,It <i>is</i> really pretty... like a flower...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=shy,Y'know, surrounded by all these guys, this is a bresh of freath-er, breath of fresh air. Doesn't even feel <i>completely</i> awkward.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,totalMales:4=beat,What, you don't like being the only girl?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jasmine=shy,O-oh, I see.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:jane,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,P-please don't do any spanking in here. It's bad enough you're naked!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... I wonder if she styles it differently from her usual costume.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sharla=pumped,You will be soon.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=awkward,And you probably shouldn't.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shy,Magic...?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=stunned,R-really? Is that all it takes to be considered mature in your world?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,Okay, seriously, how do you expect us to play with... <i>this</i> going on?!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Point is, everything's broken.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:ragequit=7-zblank,WHY?!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=embarrassed,Y-You didn't shave for someone here, did you?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=beat,Well, someone out their has their birthday on Valentine's.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=shy,So that's your little sister...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Phew... I wasn't the only one bothered by her.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=surprised,Go team...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,(Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chara=surprised,Even the pubic hair? ...Are we sure she's not Hades?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=shy,You might want to cover up. Even a little? Your... everything...is showing...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,Maybe not at first, but now that you've called me that, I can't back down now!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,<i>You</i> seem to be the one issuing challenges, Rinkah!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. Incredible...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... but I have to admit, I like the real you...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=shy,Lucky I didn't say that.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?

3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=smug,Oh, you're comfortable with this, are you?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=surprised,Oh! The shirt now?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:caleb=smug,I'm sure you're well-toned enough.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:xander=smug,This is exactly how I saw it going!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:kira=thinking,(What is he saying?)
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=joking,Whatever you say, buddy.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=happy,You ever go to the hot springs? Surely you've used them before.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:kira=awkward,Oh good. I thought you wouldn't speak English again.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=happy,Impressive! I'm still working on getting a set myself.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred,totalFemales:1-3=awkward,All these pretty ladies judging you?
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:xander=sad,If only I had your confidence.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=sad,Wish I could grow chest hair like that...
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kira=awkward,Guess we're in the same boat there.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:xander=awkward,Sorry, as someone who's beaten Donkey Kong many times, I can't relate.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=sad,Say, Lady Palutena, you don't have to do this if you don't want to...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=thinking,You kinda lost me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma=shy,Just out of curiosity, why <i>are</i> you not wearing anything under there?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=stunned,A picture? Where?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=beat,Look, I laugh about a lot of things...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=sad,Sorry, Natsuki... I don't want you exposing yourself any more than you do.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sonya=smug,Not so tough, are you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:paya=shy,No... hard... feelings?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=beat,(Hope Viridi never catches wind of this. She'd smite Morrigan herself.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=beat,That just sounds like filth to me...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=angry,Really? What tipped you off?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:peach=sad,I think I'm feeling a little nervous...
3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=pumped,Don't worry! I don't think you'll disappoint.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=shy,(Poor Nagisa looks like she's about to burst into tears...)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tina=shy,A-are they really that great?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,Hahaha~! ~player~ got busted!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,Do you really have to do it so slow? It's killing me...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=pumped,Time to demask this heroine!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lux=shy,Well, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually really curious what Lux has.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheva,marker:palutenacall=thinking,I see no net.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pearl=surprised,Y-you could've warned us first!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alpha=surprised,You didn't even hesitate to strip? I'm impressed at how brave you are.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=loss,All of a sudden?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lilith=beat,Getting pretty intense here. There are a ton of <i>Sirens</i> going off in my head.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meg=angry,I already told you, didn't I? I don't judge!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=stunned,Yes, of course! You won't hear a a peep out of me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:may=loss,Urgh...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,(I'm really going to see Samus's chest... is this real life?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,Why would you even mention that...?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,(Should we give them a nice warm welcome?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chara=surprised,Maybe you don't, but I do!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:launch=shy,Sheesh, so aggressive...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I'll, uh, pass. W-why don't you go help, ~player~?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chell=embarrassed,Really? The undershirt before the jumpsuit?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=surprised,C-Cool? But your, uh, b-boobs are...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=shy,(Ah... I just noticed the mole... it's kind of cute.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=annoyed,Please, just... make this quick...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang=shy,Well, only since you've been hyping it up all game...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou=surprised,Wait, you still have that amulet-
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:asuna=thinking,(Is this a regular thing with prisoners?...<i>Did this happen with Lady Palutena?</i>)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,My thoughts exactly, Hope.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:leela=beat,Lucky them, I guess?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ayano=angry,Cheater!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jane=embarrassed,Ahem! Yes, well, let's just move on, okay?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:dawn=happy,Ah, covering them with your hair! Smart!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sure you'll get your growth spurt some time.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=devoted,Don't be embarrassed! Even the gods can still be flat!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,There's probably a lot of perks to having them small, you know.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Don't feel bad, ~name~. They're great.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Weird to think we're almost the same chest size...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=shy,So this is what an Inkling looks like...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=shy,But this is no laughing matter.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=stunned,How come? Don't be nervous, you're in good company.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=devoted,But, uh... y-you did great! Seriously!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=awkward,Kind of a weird idea of bonding, but sure.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=awkward,More like sibling bonds, but sure.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,Goes kind of beyond simple bonding, but sure.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:sonya=annoyed,You've got some weird priorities, Sonya.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=beat,It's not bad that I'm rooting for Raven here, is it?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=stunned,That's not directed at me is it? I'll have you know these are one-hundred percent real clothes. Touch them if you don't believe me.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,This is going to be an interesting forfeit...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=awkward,Ha! Called out!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,marker:puns=joking,Not much cleavage, is there?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:misty=shy,I'm not looking! Oh, what's that over there, away from Misty? Let's have a look!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=annoyed,You've made that extensively clear.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=shy,A-again, intimidation doesn't work on me...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kim=shy,(A bit smaller than she looked.)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=shy,(A-Adorable...)
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,Tell your viewers to watch closely! I won't lose to the likes of you!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby=embarrassed,Hey, small is good! It's nice and compact.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=annoyed,Hmph! Thought you were clever?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss=shy,(A-Adorable...)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:orendi=embarrassed,I'm witnessing... something.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Yeah, not willing to challenge that.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gogo=shy,On... your back? Don't put that image in my head.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,Those also appear heavy.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=beat,Is that a bad thing? Seriously, I don't know Australian slang.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sheva=beat,This makes zero sense. Also, pretty sure it's cheating.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sonya=shy,T-they're not that great. So full of yourself...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tina=angry,Boo! False advertising!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen=shy,Erp. I don't like that look you're giving off. So full of... lust.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:samus=embarrassed,They are... they really are...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=shy,I'm not saying that. (Though I'm also not complaining.)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sharla=loss,<i>I'm... really feeling it?</i>
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,I think all those drinks got to your head.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shy,And, uh, looks like you're finally getting to the "Love Fairy" stuff? ...I'm sorry, I'm bad at small talk.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=shy,My heart's melting now...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kimberly=determined,I don't like it either, Kimberly. But if I can soldier through it, you can try too!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lara=stunned,Hey, those aren't polygonal at all!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hermione=surprised,I know! I defeated Hades for... this!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=pumped,Now you know better. That on its own could be a win!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,I mean, I'll take your word for it... but you don't seem very hopeful.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Amazing... that's all I can say, ~player~.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,They... suit you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I might've taken a few peeks. Sorry.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Woah... they look even bigger than I imagined. N-Not that I was imagining them!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=determined,They're very nice. ...Uh, right. Next hand.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=shy,You wouldn't think a criminal- who's probably wanted- would want to show off so much...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=beat,Oh geez... I didn't even realize you were aiming for the top...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jasmine=embarrassed,You're not the only thing that's been loose.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake=awkward,At least it's a learning experience, even if it's harsh.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:harley=awkward,(Maybe she's just really pale.)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,I never doubted their authenticity, Buffy...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blackrose=awkward,Right. Let's move on, everyone.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica=smug,Are you seriously into this, ~player~? You're more twisted than I thought.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:black_canary=stunned,Now I know why the caged bird sings.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ciri=stunned,I think she's talking to you, ~player~.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=embarrassed,I don't really know what to say... I was never too fond of you, but... dang...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ayano=pumped,Fine. I won't lose to someone like you anyway!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,So this is the body of someone blessed by Lady Palutena...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daphne=determined,(She's right again. I have to remember, she's the victim here, not me. Focus!)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:alice=embarrassed,What is that? A piercing? I was staring, wasn't I? Sorry.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,You didn't have to do that, you know...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daria=stunned,Oh, like a Boo?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,Yep, you got it.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,(They're so... perky...)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amy_rose=embarrassed,(Me too... mostly from how surprisingly human she looks.)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ami=beat,Yeah... not modest at all.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina=devoted,I'm proud of you. Really, I am.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,(Now I'm the one who's frozen in time...)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=surprised,Aren't you a heroine, Raven? Resist!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=beat,Do all humans act like her, ~player~? I had no idea they could be this... provocative.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=embarrassed,Ouch. I could feel that set in from here.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=awkward,She's a bit busy at the moment. She has her own hands.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=annoyed,You're all getting on my nerves, actually.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I've...earned this? I don't feel like I've done anything, though.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,W-Well, you've always been the most toned human I know. Seeing you completely naked like this is... well, I guess it is enjoyable.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:xander=thinking,(Hope my mouth wasn't open either...)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ryuko=surprised,It's the remaining ten percent that gets to me.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=shy,Oh... I guess you need more practice, Joey.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,When you say royal treasure, I hope you mean you don't, uh, display them, if you catch my meaning.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=loss,That's... just wonderful.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Or is she just smitten with Chun-Li?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:daphne=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than the fashionista over there.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:shaggy=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Mr. Zoinks over there.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=annoyed,Don't worry about her, Hope. She's everything you should <i>never</i> want to be.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica,alsoPlaying:orendi=sad,Sweet Lady Palutena, save me...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Wait, so you're actually <i>not</i> with the Forces of Nature? I've made a grave miscalculation... I'm so sorry, Amalia.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:marceline=awkward,They kinda look unhealthy, but if you're fine...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru. But they look great!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=shy,This was a bit of a surprise...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,Freckles?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Well, that jacket was pretty bulky...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=surprised,Oh. That's bad.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:penny,marker:palutenacall=shy,Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=surprised,Okay, okay! I'm sorry...
3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=sad,(She has a point... am I pervert for coming here?)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mara_jade=shy,You really should wear underwear...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:fred=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than maybe Mr. Big Talk over there.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,Meia has a point. Don't slack on staying fit!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=awkward,I'm impressed you managed to get the chest as big as Yang's before.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=beat,Don't put yourself down. I think they're fine. But then again, I don't really have a frame of reference...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gods,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,I think it does please Lady Palutena, even if she'd never admit it.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,Erp!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,...I have no words.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zoey=beat,S-Same...

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,You look flustered, Weiss. Did you know her?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:9=stunned,F-freckles?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=annoyed,Both of you are terrible human beings.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=beat,That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=thinking,Are cool mouth noises all it takes to make something sci-fi? ...This changes everything.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:may=shy,It's not like we asked you to do it, you know.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_food_motivation=awkward,N-not at all! But on an unrelated note, anyone know any good restaurants around here?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=surprised,Not even a little shy, huh...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Huh? Oh... forget I said anything.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:velma=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Ms. Jinkies, I mean.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:olympics,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=awkward,They still have nude olymics in my world! Magnus is a great wrestler, by the way.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=shy,(She looks really cute in a over-the-shoulders pose.)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:velma_classic=surprised,Probably because you're hallucinating living pictures.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=angry,Okay, seriously! <i>Not cool</i>!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=stunned,D-don't be! I think you're pretty great, y'know?

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=shy,(Be glad Dr. Mario doesn't know about here.)
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=surprised,Well that was... weird...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=devoted,Hey, I'm sure ~player~ likes them, at least. And so do I...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika=awkward,Something tells me our friend isn't going to give you feedback. But that look says it all, right?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,Wow... they look as soft as that pillow that follows you around.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,No need to be so modest, Saki! You're <i>fine.</i>
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=joking,My honest answer? An eight.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3=determined,You got it... sorry about your bra, though.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,So much for that line of conversation.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=surprised,Again. Wow.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Oh... she's back to normal.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gym,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,There's a reason tunics are the clothing of choice for humans.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=loss,I'm just gonna look at your tattoo instead, if that's okay.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=shy,Um... nice tanlines?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stunned,I can't believe what I'm seeing. My trainer is naked in front of me!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Make sure you give her lots of support, Lyn.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,As much as I like rhyming, it's not helping.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:gwen=happy,Isn't making friends such a wonderful feeling?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:faye=shy,Er, sorry. Back to card games.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, bigger than I thought!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Woah, they're huge!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Sheesh... are those as big as Lady Palutena's?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I didn't even know they could get this big on humans...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=loss,I'm sorry! I'll try not to look at them, ~name~!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:asuna=surprised,I promised I wouldn't stare, so I won't. Even if I am curious...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,That's... actually a pretty good shave job. Geez...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=surprised,Okay, okay! I didn't even really look!

3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stunned,Oh! Uh... do you want me to help you find them?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=annoyed,What are you so happy about, Ice Cream?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=sad,This is so confusing. Whose Corrin is whose?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=stunned,Plus...Ultra? That sounds cool. Wonder if I should make myself a catchy... catch-phrase too.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:ann=awkward,All I can say is sorry. Ahaha...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shy,You both do. Er, was that too rude of me?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=shy,I wish everyone here used the hand bra... (and I still want to see that monkey.)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:angie=thinking,Those are nothing like Corrin's... those are more like... who does she talk about? Camilla?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=embarrassed,Please tell me I don't have to do any of that.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:aiyana=beat,As long as you're happy. But man, this is going to be awkward...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Ah... so you were telling the truth. I'm... sorry for doubting you.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Can't really say... after all I just met you.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=embarrassed,T-tatas sound delicious... wait, I didn't mean it like that!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=beat,Maybe just... don't say anything... again.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:lilith=surprised,Are those piercings? Ouch...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=beat,Sorry. My eyes tend to wander.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=devoted,If  it makes you feel any better, you haven't lost when it counts.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Oh, Mama Mia...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:pyrrha=embarrassed,That was a corset? I-I wasn't prepared! S-Sorry...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:sonya=pumped,Good. I want to see the famous Fey and Co. Turnabout!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,You wouldn't want to know what I think. Don't mind me, just an angel who has no idea what he's doing...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,They both sound like pieces of work.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mileena=annoyed,I don't stare! And I don't <i>want</i> to stare at someone like you!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=embarrassed,I-it's fine! You <i>really</i> don't have to give us a dance right now!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa,saidMarker:playerm=shy,(I really can't blame him, though.)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya=awkward,I'm sure they would say they are great.

3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:4=embarrassed,You really should've zipped.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=shy,(Good thing too.)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:morrigan=annoyed,Shut up and keep playing.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,That was a cheap trick...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mei=surprised,(Those are way bigger than that coat would have you think.)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:navi=stunned,Wow, so blue.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:leela=victory,And now me. And ~player~. And the Dealer. And so forth.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:videl=shy,Videl's not wrong, you know...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,I'll keep my opinion to myself.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=beat,(It's like all her bluster drained away the minute she started losing. Still, it was worth the wait.)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,I... uh... those are... kinda distracting.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=shy,I get you're trying to be nice, but maybe Twilight should choose someone else to help.

3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li=smug,I was hoping you'd still be able to fight. Let's keep going.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I don't think wrestlers are supposed to act so calmly to being nearly naked...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Lady Palutena isn't your personal razor, you know!

3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=beat,(I wonder if Ryu ever wanted to see this much of Chun-Li...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=surprised,(Shoot, I'm actually really looking forward to this!)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chara=shy,Me neither, Chara. Me neither.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:harucomment,alsoPlaying:ann=surprised,Sounds just like me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elena=sad,I wish you'd get your deus ex machina, but not even Lady Palutena could help you now.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mileena=beat,*sigh* Great...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=angry,Yes! Please! For all of us here...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sharla=beat,Oh, right. Being naked is an actual strategy in your world.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:piper=sad,O-oh my.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:makotocomment,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,Guess I'm the preachy one instead.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=beat,Your lack of shame baffles me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:penny=determined,Okay! I swear, I won't look again!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:hifumicomment,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,(There isn't a strip shoji too, is there?)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,No more jokes and no more distrations...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby=loss,This is definitely happening... just don't think about it too hard...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shazza=joking,Can it really be called a morsel with how much it's covering?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:peach=beat,Prepare yourself, Pit. Here comes Peach's... peach.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Who can say for sure?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=beat,Not so much to me...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,I can completely understand tradition. But do they all come so small?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=joking,Oh no, I'm not hating! It's just that there's already so much out in the open...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=surprised,I was just surprised by how much you were showing off. I'm not hating.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Yep. So far gone, she's probably in Skyworld.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=annoyed,Button masher, huh...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm sorry, but...I'm sure you can do it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,If there's one good thing to come out of tonight, I'm going to make Cloud super jealous!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ayano=embarrassed,(Don't let it be me, don't let it be me, don't let it be me...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,I-It's a bit late for that advice at this point...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tina=awkward,Ah, you don't need 'em. The game industry is where it's at!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=determined,Just remember, it's not over yet. Stay strong.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,You didn't deny it, though...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zelda=shy,H-Hang on, I need to get ready.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=surprised,Oh yeah... she said said she doesn't wear panties...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led him on!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led her on!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=happy,Huh? Bought what?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:web=surprised,Has that... ever happened before, or are you just making it up?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,A-At least it can't get any worse for you, right?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang=smug,I know a thing or two about overconfidence. <i>You</i> were overconfident.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,I'll pass... maybe ~player~ would like to help, though.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,(At least I'm not the one being called the creep.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=shy,M-Maybe there'll be triple pants?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chica=joking,It could've fooled me...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:monika=devoted,The last piece... the final hit!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=shy,They are a bit... um... distracting...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=stunned,You did <i>what</i> to it? That just seems... wrong!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=determined,Deep breaths, Natsuki. (And you too, Pit...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=annoyed,The sex demon's getting naked? Who could've seen this coming?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou=beat,You <i>really</i> don't want to use the amulet? O-okay then.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=calm,There we go, finally almost got you!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stunned,Well that's... I mean I... excuse me for one second.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=shy,(Hope I don't pass off as a creep.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=embarrassed,Stop teasing us, Neo... please...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,...Ruby?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=joking,Wow, so many puns! I'm proud of you!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sonya=happy,You wanna finish that sentence?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Wait, why is Nadeshiko naked too?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Interesting take.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=sad,Uh oh. This is gonna be messy.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:8=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised,Waitwaitwaitwait! At least <i>warn</i> us before you go dropping your panties immediately!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=surprised,Is this a new feeling for you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=beat,You should've listened. You really should've.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=beat,I feel bad for stripping such a nice girl... but it's the game, y'know...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jasmine=shy,O-oh, I see.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:asuna=awkward,H-how'd you guess?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... I wonder if she styles it differently from her usual costume.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=joking,Those buns are toastier than I expected, actually.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:jane,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,P-please don't do any spanking in here. It's bad enough you're naked!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=beat,Corrin's too nice to brag. I'm sure he'll be a gentleman about this.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=angry,Don't try anything, Ice Cream. I won't go easy on you if you make me your enemy!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,You said it, not me... stop looking at me like that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. I think that's a bit more important than Sonya's workout routine right now...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shy,Magic...?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,How messed up are you?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chara=surprised,Even the pubic hair? ...Are we sure she's not Hades?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:ragequit=7-zblank,WHY?!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:beatrix=awkward,Doesn't mean much when you're divine, either.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=beat,Well, someone out their has their birthday on Valentine's.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:harley=beat,So... uh... cute grooming down there?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:jasmine=shy,G-Good on ya, DMG.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=shy,So that's your little sister...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,Sorry I can't help much with that. I'm no Cupid...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=surprised,What? For... her?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,Maybe not at first, but now that you've called me that, I can't back down now!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,<i>You</i> seem to be the one issuing challenges, Rinkah!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:hermione=beat,You're a pretty powerful magician yourself, Zelda. And it's against the rules, anyway.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:zoey=embarrassed,Don't shame her, Zoey. A-And that's not something you should be admitting so lightly!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,C-Cruel? What have I done?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=annoyed,Look at what you've done. Apologize to Ruby!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=surprised,(These two would make a weird team.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=joking,Seems there's a split opinion in the literature club.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. Incredible...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=awkward,Maybe you should've been the dancer of Corrin's army instead of that blue lady.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,At least it was just an illusion.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=happy,I'm hopping on the Ladybottom train too!... N-not in <i>that</i> way, but... you know what I mean...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,So, uh... go team RWBY?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Say, Lady Palutena, would my hair turn gold if I had light powers too?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,I wouldn't trust her not to brag. She gets preeeetty competitive.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,Look at what you've done. Did you really have to humiliate Yang like that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,...Blake?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Surprise, you're both filthy!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=surprised,Go team...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:3-4=embarrassed,D-don't remind me...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerm=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. He <i>wanted</i> those.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=embarrassed,Y-You didn't shave for someone here, did you?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerf=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. She <i>wanted</i> those.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:birthday=annoyed,You're playing a dangerous game...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Phew... I wasn't the only one bothered by her.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sharla=pumped,You will be soon.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=surprised,Did you do this... to flirt with us? Well, uh, gotta say, it was kind of effective.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=shy,(Again, why couldn't that sweater be just a <i>little</i> bit longer?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=beat,Saki, there's no need to be so depressing. You're fine!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=shy,You might want to cover up. Even a little? Your... everything...is showing...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I doubt that beam's very warm. But what do I know?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,marker:puns=shy,It's, uh, how do I put this... Kyu-te.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=awkward,And you probably shouldn't.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:link=smug,Oh, Link. Really?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,(Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=shy,Y'know, surrounded by all these guys, this is a bresh of freath-er, breath of fresh air. Doesn't even feel <i>completely</i> awkward.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,totalMales:4=beat,What, you don't like being the only girl?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Point is, everything's broken.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=stunned,R-really? Is that all it takes to be considered mature in your world?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=smug,I'm not scared of death! I beat the god of it, after all!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,Okay, seriously, how do you expect us to play with... <i>this</i> going on?!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=pumped,You want to take out Lady Palutena, you have to get through me first!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,W-well, it was messy... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=embarrassed,Nothing bad, I hope.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=sad,Aww, but I love the booty. N-Not that booty, but...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aiyana=embarrassed,I'll just try to pretend those tan lines are a swimsuit. Just have to avoid the finer details... like the hair....
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=beat,So that's out there now... yep... so, uh... how's it feel?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=joking,Hey now! We're <i>all</i> weird, Futaba.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=shy,Wow... that tattoo really covers <i>all over</i>...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,Oh... now I know why it hurts so much when I get hit by Peach Bomber....
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=surprised,Ouch. That's a bit overboard, don't you think?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amy_rose=thinking,No? Well okay then. (Why do I even bother sometimes...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,T-That's a bit too much info!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:faye=shy,I was curious if your hair matched, but... never mind.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha=embarrassed,I'm sorry! It's not like I want to look!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=embarrassed,Y-Yeah, save it for another time, please!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=shy,I sure hope you'll be okay... you don't have to put on a brave face for us, if you don't want to...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=sad,I could never get used to fighting naked. How do you do it?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... but I have to admit, I like the real you...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice=shy,S-someone pinch me...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=awkward,(Still better than the Aurum.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,It is a bit of an eyecatcher, huh?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:leela=shy,Don't be hard on yourself. You're more developed than any Monoeye I ever fought!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that the moon's out.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=shy,It <i>is</i> really pretty... like a flower...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=embarrassed,I kind of have a similar style... I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> poking, whatever that means.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,You're so pretty, ~player~... wait, I mean, it's, uh, okay I guess.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Is that normally how human girls style... down there?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,It's like opening a treasure box...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,That's.... yeah. Wow. So different from what I expected from you...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=loss,D-Do you want me to look away? This isn't something an angel should be looking at!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=beat,You really should have worn something else... you realize you'll have to go home like that, right?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.


#lost tunic
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=surprised,Oh! The shirt now?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=joking,Whatever you say, buddy.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:kira=thinking,(What is he saying?)
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:xander=smug,This is exactly how I saw it going!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=pumped,Isn't <i>this</i> fantastic? I won't tell Nintendo, but you better believe I'm telling everyone back home!
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:caleb=smug,I'm sure you're well-toned enough.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
4-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=smug,Oh, you're comfortable with this, are you?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=happy,Impressive! I'm still working on getting a set myself.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=sad,Wish I could grow chest hair like that...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred,totalFemales:1-3=awkward,All these pretty ladies judging you?
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:kira=awkward,Oh good. I thought you wouldn't speak English again.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=happy,You ever go to the hot springs? Surely you've used them before.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:xander=sad,If only I had your confidence.
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
4-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kira=awkward,Guess we're in the same boat there.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:xander=awkward,Sorry, as someone who's beaten Donkey Kong many times, I can't relate.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meg=angry,I already told you, didn't I? I don't judge!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheva,marker:palutenacall=thinking,I see no net.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=sad,Sorry, Natsuki... I don't want you exposing yourself any more than you do.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:paya=shy,No... hard... feelings?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=beat,(Hope Viridi never catches wind of this. She'd smite Morrigan herself.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=shy,You're really gonna go through with it?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pearl=surprised,Y-you could've warned us first!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lilith=beat,Getting pretty intense here. There are a ton of <i>Sirens</i> going off in my head.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I'll, uh, pass. W-why don't you go help, ~player~?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=surprised,C-Cool? But your, uh, b-boobs are...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chell=embarrassed,Really? The undershirt before the jumpsuit?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:peach=sad,I think I'm feeling a little nervous...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lux=shy,Well, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually really curious what Lux has.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=shy,(Ah... I just noticed the mole... it's kind of cute.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alpha=surprised,You didn't even hesitate to strip? I'm impressed at how brave you are.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma=shy,Just out of curiosity, why <i>are</i> you not wearing anything under there?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=beat,That just sounds like filth to me...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=pumped,Don't worry! I don't think you'll disappoint.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=shy,(Poor Nagisa looks like she's about to burst into tears...)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=angry,Really? What tipped you off?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=annoyed,Please, just... make this quick...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=stunned,A picture? Where?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=pumped,Time to demask this heroine!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou=surprised,Wait, you still have that amulet-
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=thinking,You kinda lost me.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang=shy,Well, only since you've been hyping it up all game...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,Hahaha~! ~player~ got busted!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sonya=smug,Not so tough, are you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tina=shy,A-are they really that great?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
4-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,Why would you even mention that...?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:asuna=thinking,(Is this a regular thing with prisoners?...<i>Did this happen with Lady Palutena?</i>)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:may=loss,Urgh...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ayano=angry,Cheater!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:leela=beat,Lucky them, I guess?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,My thoughts exactly, Hope.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,Do you really have to do it so slow? It's killing me...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=stunned,Yes, of course! You won't hear a a peep out of me.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=beat,Look, I laugh about a lot of things...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,(I'm really going to see Samus's chest... is this real life?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,(Should we give them a nice warm welcome?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:launch=shy,Sheesh, so aggressive...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chara=surprised,Maybe you don't, but I do!
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
4-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=loss,All of a sudden?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:sonya=annoyed,You've got some weird priorities, Sonya.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,Goes kind of beyond simple bonding, but sure.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=shy,(A-Adorable...)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,This is going to be an interesting forfeit...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sure you'll get your growth spurt some time.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=devoted,Don't be embarrassed! Even the gods can still be flat!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,There's probably a lot of perks to having them small, you know.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Don't feel bad, ~name~. They're great.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Weird to think we're almost the same chest size...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby=embarrassed,Hey, small is good! It's nice and compact.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:misty=shy,I'm not looking! Oh, what's that over there, away from Misty? Let's have a look!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kim=shy,(A bit smaller than she looked.)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=shy,But this is no laughing matter.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=awkward,Ha! Called out!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss=shy,(A-Adorable...)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,Tell your viewers to watch closely! I won't lose to the likes of you!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=stunned,That's not directed at me is it? I'll have you know these are one-hundred percent real clothes. Touch them if you don't believe me.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=awkward,More like sibling bonds, but sure.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jane=embarrassed,Ahem! Yes, well, let's just move on, okay?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=beat,It's not bad that I'm rooting for Raven here, is it?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=annoyed,Hmph! Thought you were clever?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=shy,So this is what an Inkling looks like...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=shy,A-again, intimidation doesn't work on me...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:dawn=happy,Ah, covering them with your hair! Smart!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=annoyed,You've made that extensively clear.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=stunned,How come? Don't be nervous, you're in good company.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=devoted,But, uh... y-you did great! Seriously!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=awkward,Kind of a weird idea of bonding, but sure.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,marker:puns=joking,Not much cleavage, is there?
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
4-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:fred=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than maybe Mr. Big Talk over there.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,No need to be so modest, Saki! You're <i>fine.</i>
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,Yep, you got it.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:velma_classic=surprised,Probably because you're hallucinating living pictures.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=devoted,Hey, I'm sure ~player~ likes them, at least. And so do I...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=surprised,Not even a little shy, huh...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=surprised,Well that was... weird...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tina=angry,Boo! False advertising!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,So this is the body of someone blessed by Lady Palutena...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:harley=awkward,(Maybe she's just really pale.)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Or is she just smitten with Chun-Li?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=shy,(She looks really cute in a over-the-shoulders pose.)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=angry,Okay, seriously! <i>Not cool</i>!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=beat,Don't put yourself down. I think they're fine. But then again, I don't really have a frame of reference...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=thinking,Are cool mouth noises all it takes to make something sci-fi? ...This changes everything.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shy,And, uh, looks like you're finally getting to the "Love Fairy" stuff? ...I'm sorry, I'm bad at small talk.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=annoyed,Don't worry about her, Hope. She's everything you should <i>never</i> want to be.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=beat,Oh geez... I didn't even realize you were aiming for the top...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,Wow... they look as soft as that pillow that follows you around.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,You didn't have to do that, you know...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3=determined,You got it... sorry about your bra, though.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I've...earned this? I don't feel like I've done anything, though.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,W-Well, you've always been the most toned human I know. Seeing you completely naked like this is... well, I guess it is enjoyable.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_food_motivation=awkward,N-not at all! But on an unrelated note, anyone know any good restaurants around here?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=beat,Do all humans act like her, ~player~? I had no idea they could be this... provocative.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika=awkward,Something tells me our friend isn't going to give you feedback. But that look says it all, right?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,...I have no words.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,Those also appear heavy.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Well, that jacket was pretty bulky...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,I think all those drinks got to your head.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daria=stunned,Oh, like a Boo?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,When you say royal treasure, I hope you mean you don't, uh, display them, if you catch my meaning.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:alice=embarrassed,What is that? A piercing? I was staring, wasn't I? Sorry.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,(Now I'm the one who's frozen in time...)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=surprised,Aren't you a heroine, Raven? Resist!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:daphne=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than the fashionista over there.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:orendi=embarrassed,I'm witnessing... something.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gogo=shy,On... your back? Don't put that image in my head.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=shy,Um... nice tanlines?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gods,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,I think it does please Lady Palutena, even if she'd never admit it.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:olympics,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=awkward,They still have nude olymics in my world! Magnus is a great wrestler, by the way.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:9=stunned,F-freckles?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=shy,You wouldn't think a criminal- who's probably wanted- would want to show off so much...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daphne=determined,(She's right again. I have to remember, she's the victim here, not me. Focus!)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:marceline=awkward,They kinda look unhealthy, but if you're fine...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Make sure you give her lots of support, Lyn.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Amazing... that's all I can say, ~player~.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,They... suit you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I might've taken a few peeks. Sorry.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Woah... they look even bigger than I imagined. N-Not that I was imagining them!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=determined,They're very nice. ...Uh, right. Next hand.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=surprised,Okay, okay! I'm sorry...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:gwen=happy,Isn't making friends such a wonderful feeling?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,Meia has a point. Don't slack on staying fit!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zoey=beat,S-Same...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=shy,(Be glad Dr. Mario doesn't know about here.)

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Oh... she's back to normal.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Huh? Oh... forget I said anything.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:xander=thinking,(Hope my mouth wasn't open either...)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kimberly=determined,I don't like it either, Kimberly. But if I can soldier through it, you can try too!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sonya=shy,T-they're not that great. So full of yourself...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:velma=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Ms. Jinkies, I mean.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ciri=stunned,I think she's talking to you, ~player~.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=pumped,Now you know better. That on its own could be a win!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=joking,My honest answer? An eight.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Yeah, not willing to challenge that.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=embarrassed,Ouch. I could feel that set in from here.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,So much for that line of conversation.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ami=beat,Yeah... not modest at all.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=loss,That's... just wonderful.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=stunned,D-don't be! I think you're pretty great, y'know?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=loss,I'm just gonna look at your tattoo instead, if that's okay.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:black_canary=stunned,Now I know why the caged bird sings.
4-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=sad,(She has a point... am I pervert for coming here?)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake=awkward,At least it's a learning experience, even if it's harsh.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=beat,That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,As much as I like rhyming, it's not helping.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=annoyed,You're all getting on my nerves, actually.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=annoyed,Both of you are terrible human beings.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gym,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,There's a reason tunics are the clothing of choice for humans.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica=smug,Are you seriously into this, ~player~? You're more twisted than I thought.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=beat,Is that a bad thing? Seriously, I don't know Australian slang.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=shy,My heart's melting now...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,You look flustered, Weiss. Did you know her?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru. But they look great!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,totalExposed:1=calm,Don't worry Florina, the rest of us will be as exposed as you soon enough.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=awkward,She's a bit busy at the moment. She has her own hands.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=shy,Oh... I guess you need more practice, Joey.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=stunned,I can't believe what I'm seeing. My trainer is naked in front of me!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ayano=pumped,Fine. I won't lose to someone like you anyway!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=shy,They do have a nice curvature...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina=devoted,I'm proud of you. Really, I am.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,I mean, I'll take your word for it... but you don't seem very hopeful.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,(They're so... perky...)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,I never doubted their authenticity, Buffy...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=surprised,Oh. That's bad.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:shaggy=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Mr. Zoinks over there.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,Freckles?
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mara_jade=shy,You really should wear underwear...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,Erp!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=shy,I'm not saying that. (Though I'm also not complaining.)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:samus=embarrassed,They are... they really are...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Wait, so you're actually <i>not</i> with the Forces of Nature? I've made a grave miscalculation... I'm so sorry, Amalia.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=shy,This was a bit of a surprise...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica,alsoPlaying:orendi=sad,Sweet Lady Palutena, save me...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blackrose=awkward,Right. Let's move on, everyone.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=awkward,I'm impressed you managed to get the chest as big as Yang's before.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sheva=beat,This makes zero sense. Also, pretty sure it's cheating.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hermione=surprised,I know! I defeated Hades for... this!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:penny,marker:palutenacall=shy,Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amy_rose=embarrassed,(Me too... mostly from how surprisingly human she looks.)
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=embarrassed,I don't really know what to say... I was never too fond of you, but... dang...
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:may=shy,It's not like we asked you to do it, you know.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen=shy,Erp. I don't like that look you're giving off. So full of... lust.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sharla=loss,<i>I'm... really feeling it?</i>
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ryuko=surprised,It's the remaining ten percent that gets to me.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lara=stunned,Hey, those aren't polygonal at all!
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jasmine=embarrassed,You're not the only thing that's been loose.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,Right. N-No need to be ashamed.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shy,You both do. Er, was that too rude of me?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mei=surprised,(Those are way bigger than that coat would have you think.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,That's... actually a pretty good shave job. Geez...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=annoyed,What are you so happy about, Ice Cream?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:aiyana=beat,As long as you're happy. But man, this is going to be awkward...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,That was a cheap trick...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chiaki=embarrassed,Please tell me I don't have to do any of that.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=sad,This is so confusing. Whose Corrin is whose?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=shy,(Good thing too.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:angie=thinking,Those are nothing like Corrin's... those are more like... who does she talk about? Camilla?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya=awkward,I'm sure they would say they are great.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:ann=awkward,All I can say is sorry. Ahaha...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Can't really say... after all I just met you.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=embarrassed,T-tatas sound delicious... wait, I didn't mean it like that!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:pyrrha=embarrassed,That was a corset? I-I wasn't prepared! S-Sorry...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:faye=shy,Er, sorry. Back to card games.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I don't think wrestlers are supposed to act so calmly to being nearly naked...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=shy,I wish everyone here used the hand bra... (and I still want to see that monkey.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Issues with the other girls aside, uh, wow.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,I'll keep my opinion to myself.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=stunned,Plus...Ultra? That sounds cool. Wonder if I should make myself a catchy... catch-phrase too.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=beat,(It's like all her bluster drained away the minute she started losing. Still, it was worth the wait.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=beat,Maybe just... don't say anything... again.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:lilith=surprised,Are those piercings? Ouch...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=beat,Sorry. My eyes tend to wander.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Ah... so you were telling the truth. I'm... sorry for doubting you.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stunned,Oh! Uh... do you want me to help you find them?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=embarrassed,I-it's fine! You <i>really</i> don't have to give us a dance right now!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa=shy,(I really can't blame them, though.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,You wouldn't want to know what I think. Don't mind me, just an angel who has no idea what he's doing...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:navi=stunned,Wow, so blue.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:asuna=surprised,I promised I wouldn't stare, so I won't. Even if I am curious...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=sad,I could use a good laugh right now.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:morrigan=annoyed,Shut up and keep playing.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,I... uh... those are... kinda distracting.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=shy,I get you're trying to be nice, but maybe Twilight should choose someone else to help.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Oh, Mama Mia...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Wow, bigger than I thought!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Woah, they're huge!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Sheesh... are those as big as Lady Palutena's?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I didn't even know they could get this big on humans...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=loss,I'm sorry! I'll try not to look at them, ~name~!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa,saidMarker:playerf=shy,(I really can't blame her, though.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:launch=smug,(Not so tough without your gun, are you?)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mileena=annoyed,I don't stare! And I don't <i>want</i> to stare at someone like you!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=surprised,Okay, okay! I didn't even really look!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=devoted,If  it makes you feel any better, you haven't lost when it counts.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:tifa,saidMarker:playerm=shy,(I really can't blame him, though.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:sonya=pumped,Good. I want to see the famous Fey and Co. Turnabout!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:4=embarrassed,You really should've zipped.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,They both sound like pieces of work.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=stunned,You get hotspring buddies in your world? (Lucky...)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=beat,Bit of a stretch, I know. But I <i>had</i> to say it!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:misato=shy,(Just look at the sweet scar, Pit. Don't let her intimidate you.)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Poor girl's having her reality crushed.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:leela=victory,And now me. And ~player~. And the Dealer. And so forth.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li=smug,I was hoping you'd still be able to fight. Let's keep going.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:videl=shy,Videl's not wrong, you know...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led him on!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led her on!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=surprised,Oh yeah... she said said she doesn't wear panties...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shazza=joking,Can it really be called a morsel with how much it's covering?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=happy,Huh? Bought what?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby=loss,This is definitely happening... just don't think about it too hard...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm sorry, but...I'm sure you can do it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,A-At least it can't get any worse for you, right?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chara=shy,Me neither, Chara. Me neither.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=shy,I can hardly believe this myself, Elaine... Is that a tattoo?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elena=sad,I wish you'd get your deus ex machina, but not even Lady Palutena could help you now.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sharla=beat,Oh, right. Being naked is an actual strategy in your world.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:web=surprised,Has that... ever happened before, or are you just making it up?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=determined,Just remember, it's not over yet. Stay strong.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=beat,I feel bad for stripping such a nice girl... but it's the game, y'know...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chica=joking,It could've fooled me...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,I'll pass... maybe ~player~ would like to help, though.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zelda=shy,H-Hang on, I need to get ready.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:monika=devoted,The last piece... the final hit!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=calm,There we go, finally almost got you!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou=beat,You <i>really</i> don't want to use the amulet? O-okay then.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=annoyed,The sex demon's getting naked? Who could've seen this coming?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=stunned,You did <i>what</i> to it? That just seems... wrong!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=determined,Deep breaths, Natsuki. (And you too, Pit...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mileena=beat,*sigh* Great...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:peach=beat,Prepare yourself, Pit. Here comes Peach's... peach.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,You didn't deny it, though...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Who can say for sure?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,If there's one good thing to come out of tonight, I'm going to make Cloud super jealous!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,I-It's a bit late for that advice at this point...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ayano=embarrassed,(Don't let it be me, don't let it be me, don't let it be me...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:piper=sad,O-oh my.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=surprised,Is this a new feeling for you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tina=awkward,Ah, you don't need 'em. The game industry is where it's at!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=shy,Seems like it. Just as I predicted.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=beat,Your lack of shame baffles me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:makotocomment,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,Guess I'm the preachy one instead.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:hifumicomment,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,(There isn't a strip shoji too, is there?)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,No more jokes and no more distrations...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=annoyed,Button masher, huh...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Lady Palutena isn't your personal razor, you know!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=beat,(I wonder if Ryu ever wanted to see this much of Chun-Li...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=angry,Yes! Please! For all of us here...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:8=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:penny=determined,Okay! I swear, I won't look again!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:harucomment,alsoPlaying:ann=surprised,Sounds just like me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=surprised,(Shoot, I'm actually really looking forward to this!)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sonya=happy,You wanna finish that sentence?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=shy,M-Maybe there'll be triple pants?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stunned,Well that's... I mean I... excuse me for one second.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=embarrassed,Stop teasing us, Neo... please...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=sad,Uh oh. This is gonna be messy.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Interesting take.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Wait, why is Nadeshiko naked too?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Yep. So far gone, she's probably in Skyworld.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=shy,They are a bit... um... distracting...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,I can completely understand tradition. But do they all come so small?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=joking,Oh no, I'm not hating! It's just that there's already so much out in the open...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=surprised,I was just surprised by how much you were showing off. I'm not hating.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,(At least I'm not the one being called the creep.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=beat,Not so much to me...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,...Ruby?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=shy,(Hope I don't pass off as a creep.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=joking,Wow, so many puns! I'm proud of you!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised,Waitwaitwaitwait! At least <i>warn</i> us before you go dropping your panties immediately!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... but I have to admit, I like the real you...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Surprise, you're both filthy!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. Incredible...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,(Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,Maybe not at first, but now that you've called me that, I can't back down now!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,<i>You</i> seem to be the one issuing challenges, Rinkah!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=beat,You really should have worn something else... you realize you'll have to go home like that, right?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=annoyed,Look at what you've done. Apologize to Ruby!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:harley=beat,So... uh... cute grooming down there?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=surprised,My wings are already complaining...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:faye=shy,I was curious if your hair matched, but... never mind.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:link=smug,Oh, Link. Really?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=joking,Seems there's a split opinion in the literature club.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=surprised,What? For... her?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=angry,Don't try anything, Ice Cream. I won't go easy on you if you make me your enemy!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I doubt that beam's very warm. But what do I know?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=surprised,Did you do this... to flirt with us? Well, uh, gotta say, it was kind of effective.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=embarrassed,Y-You didn't shave for someone here, did you?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=pumped,You want to take out Lady Palutena, you have to get through me first!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:zoey=embarrassed,Don't shame her, Zoey. A-And that's not something you should be admitting so lightly!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,Sorry I can't help much with that. I'm no Cupid...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=joking,Hey now! We're <i>all</i> weird, Futaba.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Phew... I wasn't the only one bothered by her.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=awkward,And you probably shouldn't.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,How messed up are you?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,You said it, not me... stop looking at me like that.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=embarrassed,I kind of have a similar style... I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> poking, whatever that means.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,T-That's a bit too much info!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,It is a bit of an eyecatcher, huh?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Say, Lady Palutena, would my hair turn gold if I had light powers too?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:jane,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,P-please don't do any spanking in here. It's bad enough you're naked!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=smug,I'm not scared of death! I beat the god of it, after all!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=joking,Those buns are toastier than I expected, actually.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=embarrassed,Y-Yeah, save it for another time, please!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=embarrassed,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:jasmine=shy,G-Good on ya, DMG.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=stunned,R-really? Is that all it takes to be considered mature in your world?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,Okay, seriously, how do you expect us to play with... <i>this</i> going on?!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Point is, everything's broken.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:beatrix=awkward,Doesn't mean much when you're divine, either.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,Look at what you've done. Did you really have to humiliate Yang like that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shy,Magic...?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=shy,I sure hope you'll be okay... you don't have to put on a brave face for us, if you don't want to...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,I wouldn't trust her not to brag. She gets preeeetty competitive.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:leela=shy,Don't be hard on yourself. You're more developed than any Monoeye I ever fought!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sharla=pumped,You will be soon.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerf=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. She <i>wanted</i> those.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:ragequit=7-zblank,WHY?!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerm=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. He <i>wanted</i> those.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,So, uh... go team RWBY?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,You're so pretty, ~player~... wait, I mean, it's, uh, okay I guess.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Is that normally how human girls style... down there?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,It's like opening a treasure box...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,That's.... yeah. Wow. So different from what I expected from you...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=loss,D-Do you want me to look away? This isn't something an angel should be looking at!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amy_rose=thinking,No? Well okay then. (Why do I even bother sometimes...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,...Blake?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=surprised,Go team...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=beat,Corrin's too nice to brag. I'm sure he'll be a gentleman about this.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=shy,So that's your little sister...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:3-4=embarrassed,D-don't remind me...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=shy,Y'know, surrounded by all these guys, this is a bresh of freath-er, breath of fresh air. Doesn't even feel <i>completely</i> awkward.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=shy,Wow... that tattoo really covers <i>all over</i>...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=beat,Well, someone out their has their birthday on Valentine's.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=awkward,(Still better than the Aurum.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,W-well, it was messy... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha=embarrassed,I'm sorry! It's not like I want to look!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aiyana=embarrassed,I'll just try to pretend those tan lines are a swimsuit. Just have to avoid the finer details... like the hair....
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=beat,So that's out there now... yep... so, uh... how's it feel?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,totalMales:4=beat,What, you don't like being the only girl?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=awkward,Maybe you should've been the dancer of Corrin's army instead of that blue lady.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:birthday=annoyed,You're playing a dangerous game...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,Oh... now I know why it hurts so much when I get hit by Peach Bomber....
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chara=surprised,Even the pubic hair? ...Are we sure she's not Hades?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=sad,I could never get used to fighting naked. How do you do it?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=happy,I'm hopping on the Ladybottom train too!... N-not in <i>that</i> way, but... you know what I mean...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=surprised,(These two would make a weird team.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=embarrassed,Nothing bad, I hope.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice=shy,S-someone pinch me...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:asuna=awkward,H-how'd you guess?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=shy,You might want to cover up. Even a little? Your... everything...is showing...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:hermione=beat,You're a pretty powerful magician yourself, Zelda. And it's against the rules, anyway.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jasmine=shy,O-oh, I see.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,C-Cruel? What have I done?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... I wonder if she styles it differently from her usual costume.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=shy,It <i>is</i> really pretty... like a flower...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=sad,Aww, but I love the booty. N-Not that booty, but...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,marker:puns=shy,It's, uh, how do I put this... Kyu-te.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. I think that's a bit more important than Sonya's workout routine right now...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=shy,(Again, why couldn't that sweater be just a <i>little</i> bit longer?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,At least it was just an illusion.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=beat,Saki, there's no need to be so depressing. You're fine!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that the moon's out.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:kira=thinking,(What is he saying?)
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=smug,Oh, you're comfortable with this, are you?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=surprised,Oh! The shirt now?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred,totalFemales:1-3=awkward,All these pretty ladies judging you?

-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:xander=sad,If only I had your confidence.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=happy,You ever go to the hot springs? Surely you've used them before.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=happy,Impressive! I'm still working on getting a set myself.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kira=awkward,Guess we're in the same boat there.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:xander=awkward,Sorry, as someone who's beaten Donkey Kong many times, I can't relate.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma=shy,Just out of curiosity, why <i>are</i> you not wearing anything under there?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lux=shy,Well, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually really curious what Lux has.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:launch=shy,Sheesh, so aggressive...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:paya=shy,No... hard... feelings?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,(Should we give them a nice warm welcome?)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I'll, uh, pass. W-why don't you go help, ~player~?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=stunned,A picture? Where?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meg=angry,I already told you, didn't I? I don't judge!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sonya=smug,Not so tough, are you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=thinking,You kinda lost me.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tina=shy,A-are they really that great?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,(I'm really going to see Samus's chest... is this real life?)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,Why would you even mention that...?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,Hahaha~! ~player~ got busted!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,My thoughts exactly, Hope.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ayano=angry,Cheater!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:asuna=thinking,(Is this a regular thing with prisoners?...<i>Did this happen with Lady Palutena?</i>)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=beat,Look, I laugh about a lot of things...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=stunned,Yes, of course! You won't hear a a peep out of me.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,Do you really have to do it so slow? It's killing me...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=loss,All of a sudden?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou=surprised,Wait, you still have that amulet-
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
-3-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang=shy,Well, only since you've been hyping it up all game...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:may=loss,Urgh...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=embarrassed,If I was really fortunate, I'd still have my clothes.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Y-You're really gonna expose yourself, too?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot springs lover! That's how I'm getting through this...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=beat,(Hope Viridi never catches wind of this. She'd smite Morrigan herself.)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=pumped,Time to demask this heroine!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lilith=beat,Getting pretty intense here. There are a ton of <i>Sirens</i> going off in my head.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=pumped,Don't worry! I don't think you'll disappoint.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=shy,(Poor Nagisa looks like she's about to burst into tears...)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chell=embarrassed,Really? The undershirt before the jumpsuit?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=shy,A-again, intimidation doesn't work on me...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,Goes kind of beyond simple bonding, but sure.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,Tell your viewers to watch closely! I won't lose to the likes of you!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,marker:puns=joking,Not much cleavage, is there?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sure you'll get your growth spurt some time.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=devoted,Don't be embarrassed! Even the gods can still be flat!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,There's probably a lot of perks to having them small, you know.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Don't feel bad, ~name~. They're great.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Weird to think we're almost the same chest size...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=beat,It's not bad that I'm rooting for Raven here, is it?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=shy,(A-Adorable...)
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jane=embarrassed,Ahem! Yes, well, let's just move on, okay?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:sonya=annoyed,You've got some weird priorities, Sonya.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss=shy,(A-Adorable...)
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,I won't lose to you! Even if I have lost my dignity...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=annoyed,You've made that extensively clear.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=shy,But this is no laughing matter.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=awkward,Ha! Called out!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:dawn=happy,Ah, covering them with your hair! Smart!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=shy,So this is what an Inkling looks like...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=stunned,How come? Don't be nervous, you're in good company.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby=embarrassed,Hey, small is good! It's nice and compact.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=awkward,Kind of a weird idea of bonding, but sure.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=stunned,That's not directed at me is it? I'll have you know these are one-hundred percent real clothes. Touch them if you don't believe me.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kim=shy,(A bit smaller than she looked.)
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,This is going to be an interesting forfeit...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=awkward,More like sibling bonds, but sure.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=devoted,But, uh... y-you did great! Seriously!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=annoyed,Hmph! Thought you were clever?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:misty=shy,I'm not looking! Oh, what's that over there, away from Misty? Let's have a look!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:moon=beat,Do all humans act like her, ~player~? I had no idea they could be this... provocative.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=beat,Is that a bad thing? Seriously, I don't know Australian slang.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=embarrassed,Ouch. I could feel that set in from here.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pauling=shy,They do have a nice curvature...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,No need to be so modest, Saki! You're <i>fine.</i>
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,Erp!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:gwen=happy,Isn't making friends such a wonderful feeling?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=surprised,Oh. That's bad.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daria=stunned,Oh, like a Boo?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:monika=awkward,Something tells me our friend isn't going to give you feedback. But that look says it all, right?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:penny,marker:palutenacall=shy,Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,So this is the body of someone blessed by Lady Palutena...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sheva=beat,This makes zero sense. Also, pretty sure it's cheating.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:9=stunned,F-freckles?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sf=thinking,Are cool mouth noises all it takes to make something sci-fi? ...This changes everything.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,Huh? Oh... forget I said anything.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki=devoted,Hey, I'm sure ~player~ likes them, at least. And so do I...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=angry,Okay, seriously! <i>Not cool</i>!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daphne=determined,(She's right again. I have to remember, she's the victim here, not me. Focus!)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=embarrassed,Wait, so you're actually <i>not</i> with the Forces of Nature? I've made a grave miscalculation... I'm so sorry, Amalia.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Oh... she's back to normal.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shy,I've...earned this? I don't feel like I've done anything, though.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,W-Well, you've always been the most toned human I know. Seeing you completely naked like this is... well, I guess it is enjoyable.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,Freckles?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_f=embarrassed,I don't really know what to say... I was never too fond of you, but... dang...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,I think all those drinks got to your head.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mahiru=embarrassed,N-No, Mahiru.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,...I have no words.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,When you say royal treasure, I hope you mean you don't, uh, display them, if you catch my meaning.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ciri=stunned,I think she's talking to you, ~player~.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sonya=shy,T-they're not that great. So full of yourself...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sharla=loss,<i>I'm... really feeling it?</i>
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ayano=pumped,Fine. I won't lose to someone like you anyway!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=surprised,Aren't you a heroine, Raven? Resist!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayla=shy,Um... nice tanlines?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,(They're so... perky...)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Make sure you give her lots of support, Lyn.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,Yep, you got it.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:olympics,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=awkward,They still have nude olymics in my world! Magnus is a great wrestler, by the way.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Yeah, not willing to challenge that.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mercy=joking,My honest answer? An eight.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amy_rose=embarrassed,(Me too... mostly from how surprisingly human she looks.)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,I mean, I'll take your word for it... but you don't seem very hopeful.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=shy,My heart's melting now...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:may=shy,It's not like we asked you to do it, you know.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=pumped,Now you know better. That on its own could be a win!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,Meia has a point. Don't slack on staying fit!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,I have a sudden urge to subscribe to you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,(Now I'm the one who's frozen in time...)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=loss,I'm just gonna look at your tattoo instead, if that's okay.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:xander=thinking,(Hope my mouth wasn't open either...)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hermione=surprised,I know! I defeated Hades for... this!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_food_motivation=awkward,N-not at all! But on an unrelated note, anyone know any good restaurants around here?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:orendi=embarrassed,I'm witnessing... something.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lara=stunned,Hey, those aren't polygonal at all!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=awkward,I'm impressed you managed to get the chest as big as Yang's before.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia=beat,Don't put yourself down. I think they're fine. But then again, I don't really have a frame of reference...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=annoyed,Don't worry about her, Hope. She's everything you should <i>never</i> want to be.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shy,And, uh, looks like you're finally getting to the "Love Fairy" stuff? ...I'm sorry, I'm bad at small talk.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:daphne=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than the fashionista over there.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=shy,Oh... I guess you need more practice, Joey.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,I never doubted their authenticity, Buffy...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gods,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,I think it does please Lady Palutena, even if she'd never admit it.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gwen=shy,Erp. I don't like that look you're giving off. So full of... lust.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa=stunned,D-don't be! I think you're pretty great, y'know?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina=devoted,I'm proud of you. Really, I am.
-3-female_removed_major,target:clover,targetStage:4=sad,(She has a point... am I pervert for coming here?)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:marceline=awkward,They kinda look unhealthy, but if you're fine...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=beat,Oh geez... I didn't even realize you were aiming for the top...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:shaggy=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Mr. Zoinks over there.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gogo=shy,On... your back? Don't put that image in my head.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake=awkward,At least it's a learning experience, even if it's harsh.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,You didn't have to do that, you know...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=shy,You wouldn't think a criminal- who's probably wanted- would want to show off so much...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zoey=beat,S-Same...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=shy,(Be glad Dr. Mario doesn't know about here.)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=surprised,Well that was... weird...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,totalExposed:1=calm,Don't worry Florina, the rest of us will be as exposed as you soon enough.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=surprised,Again. Wow.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Amazing... that's all I can say, ~player~.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,They... suit you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I might've taken a few peeks. Sorry.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Woah... they look even bigger than I imagined. N-Not that I was imagining them!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=determined,They're very nice. ...Uh, right. Next hand.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:harley=awkward,(Maybe she's just really pale.)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:mara_jade=shy,You really should wear underwear...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,Wow... they look as soft as that pillow that follows you around.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=shy,(She looks really cute in a over-the-shoulders pose.)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:fred=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than maybe Mr. Big Talk over there.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=loss,That's... just wonderful.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:velma=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays? Other than Ms. Jinkies, I mean.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,As much as I like rhyming, it's not helping.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Well, that jacket was pretty bulky...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=surprised,Okay, okay! I'm sorry...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=annoyed,You're all getting on my nerves, actually.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica=smug,Are you seriously into this, ~player~? You're more twisted than I thought.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:6=shy,Wow. W-Who uses "groovy" seriously nowadays?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Or is she just smitten with Chun-Li?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=shy,I'm not saying that. (Though I'm also not complaining.)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:velma_classic=surprised,Probably because you're hallucinating living pictures.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=beat,That seems a bit harsh, doesn't it?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tina=angry,Boo! False advertising!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3=determined,You got it... sorry about your bra, though.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetNotSaidMarker:gym,alsoPlaying:marceline,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=shy,There's a reason tunics are the clothing of choice for humans.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:alice=embarrassed,What is that? A piercing? I was staring, wasn't I? Sorry.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=awkward,She's a bit busy at the moment. She has her own hands.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:black_canary=stunned,Now I know why the caged bird sings.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,So much for that line of conversation.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:samus=embarrassed,They are... they really are...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:7=surprised,Not even a little shy, huh...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:chica,alsoPlaying:orendi=sad,Sweet Lady Palutena, save me...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:shego=annoyed,Both of you are terrible human beings.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ami=beat,Yeah... not modest at all.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kimberly=determined,I don't like it either, Kimberly. But if I can soldier through it, you can try too!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:blackrose=awkward,Right. Let's move on, everyone.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zelda=surprised,Right. N-No need to be ashamed.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:piper=shy,This was a bit of a surprise...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,Those also appear heavy.

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=horny,I-I mean... should I be enjoying this? This is a lot closer to you than I ever thought I'd get...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jasmine=embarrassed,You're not the only thing that's been loose.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ryuko=surprised,It's the remaining ten percent that gets to me.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=surprised,You look flustered, Weiss. Did you know her?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=stunned,Plus...Ultra? That sounds cool. Wonder if I should make myself a catchy... catch-phrase too.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,You wouldn't want to know what I think. Don't mind me, just an angel who has no idea what he's doing...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:velma=stunned,Oh! Uh... do you want me to help you find them?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:faye=shy,Er, sorry. Back to card games.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:angie=thinking,Those are nothing like Corrin's... those are more like... who does she talk about? Camilla?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li=smug,I was hoping you'd still be able to fight. Let's keep going.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:aiyana=beat,As long as you're happy. But man, this is going to be awkward...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:lilith=surprised,Are those piercings? Ouch...

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:annie=shy,I wish everyone here used the hand bra... (and I still want to see that monkey.)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Ah... so you were telling the truth. I'm... sorry for doubting you.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=beat,Bit of a stretch, I know. But I <i>had</i> to say it!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chara=embarrassed,T-tatas sound delicious... wait, I didn't mean it like that!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Oh, Mama Mia...

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mei=surprised,(Those are way bigger than that coat would have you think.)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:leela=victory,And now me. And ~player~. And the Dealer. And so forth.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=annoyed,What are you so happy about, Ice Cream?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,I... uh... those are... kinda distracting.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:kurumu=shy,I get you're trying to be nice, but maybe Twilight should choose someone else to help.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=sad,This is so confusing. Whose Corrin is whose?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:korra=surprised,Okay, okay! I didn't even really look!

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Sheesh... are those as big as Lady Palutena's?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I didn't even know they could get this big on humans...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human=loss,I'm sorry! I'll try not to look at them, ~name~!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,That's... actually a pretty good shave job. Geez...

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:launch=smug,(Not so tough without your gun, are you?)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,That was a cheap trick...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:sonya=pumped,Good. I want to see the famous Fey and Co. Turnabout!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:4=embarrassed,You really should've zipped.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I don't think wrestlers are supposed to act so calmly to being nearly naked...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:pyrrha=embarrassed,That was a corset? I-I wasn't prepared! S-Sorry...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=beat,(It's like all her bluster drained away the minute she started losing. Still, it was worth the wait.)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia,alsoPlaying:videl=shy,Videl's not wrong, you know...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:paya=awkward,I'm sure they would say they are great.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,I'll keep my opinion to myself.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shy,You both do. Er, was that too rude of me?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:seven=beat,Sorry. My eyes tend to wander.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:aimee=annoyed,They both sound like pieces of work.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=beat,I feel bad for stripping such a nice girl... but it's the game, y'know...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou=beat,You <i>really</i> don't want to use the amulet? O-okay then.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,Uh-oh. She can tell if I get hard...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=stunned,You did <i>what</i> to it? That just seems... wrong!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:monika=devoted,The last piece... the final hit!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=determined,Deep breaths, Natsuki. (And you too, Pit...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,I'll pass... maybe ~player~ would like to help, though.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=calm,There we go, finally almost got you!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chica=joking,It could've fooled me...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang=smug,I know a thing or two about overconfidence. <i>You</i> were overconfident.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,count-halloween_pit:0=determined,No way... I can't let this happen!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zelda=shy,H-Hang on, I need to get ready.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=annoyed,The sex demon's getting naked? Who could've seen this coming?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,A-At least it can't get any worse for you, right?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tina=awkward,Ah, you don't need 'em. The game industry is where it's at!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ayano=embarrassed,(Don't let it be me, don't let it be me, don't let it be me...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,I-It's a bit late for that advice at this point...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,If there's one good thing to come out of tonight, I'm going to make Cloud super jealous!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Who can say for sure?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:8=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,(At least I'm not the one being called the creep.)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=beat,(I wonder if Ryu ever wanted to see this much of Chun-Li...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=surprised,Oh yeah... she said said she doesn't wear panties...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led him on!

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Yep. So far gone, she's probably in Skyworld.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:web=surprised,Has that... ever happened before, or are you just making it up?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,I can completely understand tradition. But do they all come so small?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=joking,Oh no, I'm not hating! It's just that there's already so much out in the open...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=surprised,I was just surprised by how much you were showing off. I'm not hating.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=beat,Not so much to me...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Lady Palutena isn't your personal razor, you know!

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,...Ruby?

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=sad,Uh oh. This is gonna be messy.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=beat,Your lack of shame baffles me.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stunned,Well that's... I mean I... excuse me for one second.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,You didn't deny it, though...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shazza=joking,Can it really be called a morsel with how much it's covering?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:peach=beat,Prepare yourself, Pit. Here comes Peach's... peach.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mileena=beat,*sigh* Great...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm sorry, but...I'm sure you can do it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=determined,Just remember, it's not over yet. Stay strong.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sharla=beat,Oh, right. Being naked is an actual strategy in your world.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elena=sad,I wish you'd get your deus ex machina, but not even Lady Palutena could help you now.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=shy,I can hardly believe this myself, Elaine... Is that a tattoo?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby=loss,This is definitely happening... just don't think about it too hard...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chara=surprised,Even the pubic hair? ...Are we sure she's not Hades?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:leela=shy,Don't be hard on yourself. You're more developed than any Monoeye I ever fought!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=joking,Seems there's a split opinion in the literature club.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=sad,I could never get used to fighting naked. How do you do it?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,Sorry I can't help much with that. I'm no Cupid...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=surprised,(These two would make a weird team.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=surprised,What? For... her?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=shy,So that's your little sister...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:hermione=beat,You're a pretty powerful magician yourself, Zelda. And it's against the rules, anyway.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,Oh... now I know why it hurts so much when I get hit by Peach Bomber....
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=horny,(T-Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight. I never thought I'd get to see a goddess's butt!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=beat,Well, someone out their has their birthday on Valentine's.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=annoyed,Look at what you've done. Apologize to Ruby!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:jasmine=shy,G-Good on ya, DMG.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... just like mine.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha=embarrassed,I'm sorry! It's not like I want to look!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that the moon's out.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:3,marker:ragequit=7-zblank,WHY?!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,C-Cruel? What have I done?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,Maybe not at first, but now that you've called me that, I can't back down now!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=smug,<i>You</i> seem to be the one issuing challenges, Rinkah!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:beatrix=awkward,Doesn't mean much when you're divine, either.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=embarrassed,Nothing bad, I hope.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,I wouldn't trust her not to brag. She gets preeeetty competitive.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Surprise, you're both filthy!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=embarrassed,Y-Yeah, save it for another time, please!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=beat,Corrin's too nice to brag. I'm sure he'll be a gentleman about this.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=angry,Don't try anything, Ice Cream. I won't go easy on you if you make me your enemy!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=shy,Wow... that tattoo really covers <i>all over</i>...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=awkward,Maybe you should've been the dancer of Corrin's army instead of that blue lady.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,So, uh... go team RWBY?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=shy,I sure hope you'll be okay... you don't have to put on a brave face for us, if you don't want to...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,W-well, it was messy... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,...Blake?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:3=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=embarrassed,I kind of have a similar style... I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> poking, whatever that means.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,Look at what you've done. Did you really have to humiliate Yang like that?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=beat,You really should have worn something else... you realize you'll have to go home like that, right?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,T-That's a bit too much info!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,You're so pretty, ~player~... wait, I mean, it's, uh, okay I guess.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Is that normally how human girls style... down there?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,It's like opening a treasure box...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,That's.... yeah. Wow. So different from what I expected from you...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=loss,D-Do you want me to look away? This isn't something an angel should be looking at!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=happy,I'm hopping on the Ladybottom train too!... N-not in <i>that</i> way, but... you know what I mean...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=shy,Magic...?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... but I have to admit, I like the real you...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,At least it was just an illusion.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:faye=shy,I was curious if your hair matched, but... never mind.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,How messed up are you?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=sad,Aww, but I love the booty. N-Not that booty, but...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice=shy,S-someone pinch me...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. I think that's a bit more important than Sonya's workout routine right now...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. Incredible...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,You said it, not me... stop looking at me like that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aiyana=embarrassed,I'll just try to pretend those tan lines are a swimsuit. Just have to avoid the finer details... like the hair....
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Say, Lady Palutena, would my hair turn gold if I had light powers too?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amy_rose=thinking,No? Well okay then. (Why do I even bother sometimes...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=horny,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=horny,I-I can't believe you two trust each other enough to take naked selfies together!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=horny,I-I can't believe you two trust each other enough to take naked selfies together!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=horny,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:birthday=annoyed,You're playing a dangerous game...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Phew... I wasn't the only one bothered by her.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=awkward,And you probably shouldn't.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=horny,Two beautiful women giving a V-sign... Ohhh man...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=horny,M-Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=smug,I'm not scared of death! I beat the god of it, after all!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=embarrassed,Y-You didn't shave for someone here, did you?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerm=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. He <i>wanted</i> those.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=horny,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sharla=pumped,You will be soon.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=surprised,Go team...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=horny,M-Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=horny,Two beautiful women giving a V-sign... Ohhh man...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerf=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. She <i>wanted</i> those.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=shy,(Again, why couldn't that sweater be just a <i>little</i> bit longer?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:jane,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,P-please don't do any spanking in here. It's bad enough you're naked!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:asuna=awkward,H-how'd you guess?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jasmine=shy,O-oh, I see.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rosalina=shy,You might want to cover up. Even a little? Your... everything...is showing...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=joking,Those buns are toastier than I expected, actually.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... I wonder if she styles it differently from her usual costume.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I doubt that beam's very warm. But what do I know?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=beat,Saki, there's no need to be so depressing. You're fine!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daisy=shy,It <i>is</i> really pretty... like a flower...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=pumped,You want to take out Lady Palutena, you have to get through me first!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,marker:puns=shy,It's, uh, how do I put this... Kyu-te.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:zoey=embarrassed,Don't shame her, Zoey. A-And that's not something you should be admitting so lightly!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=surprised,Did you do this... to flirt with us? Well, uh, gotta say, it was kind of effective.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=horny,W-Where are you putting your hand, April? And on camera?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=beat,So that's out there now... yep... so, uh... how's it feel?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:3-4=embarrassed,D-don't remind me...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=stunned,R-really? Is that all it takes to be considered mature in your world?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=shy,Y'know, surrounded by all these guys, this is a bresh of freath-er, breath of fresh air. Doesn't even feel <i>completely</i> awkward.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=joking,Hey now! We're <i>all</i> weird, Futaba.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=awkward,(Still better than the Aurum.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,It is a bit of an eyecatcher, huh?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,totalMales:4=beat,What, you don't like being the only girl?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko,totalNaked:5=embarrassed,I feel like I've seen this somewhere before.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:5=shy,I, uh, hope me being a naked guy doesn't intimidate you.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Point is, everything's broken.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:link=smug,Oh, Link. Really?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,Okay, seriously, how do you expect us to play with... <i>this</i> going on?!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:harley=beat,So... uh... cute grooming down there?

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=beat,Way to make things more awkward, dude.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=joking,Whatever you say, buddy.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:caleb=smug,I'm sure you're well-toned enough.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=surprised,Oh! The shirt now?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:kira=thinking,(What is he saying?)
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:xander=smug,This is exactly how I saw it going!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=smug,Oh, you're comfortable with this, are you?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=pumped,Isn't <i>this</i> fantastic? I won't tell Nintendo, but you better believe I'm telling everyone back home!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=awkward,Uh-huh, don't care. Need to get this over with.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=happy,Impressive! I'm still working on getting a set myself.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=happy,You ever go to the hot springs? Surely you've used them before.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=sad,Wish I could grow chest hair like that...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:kira=awkward,Oh good. I thought you wouldn't speak English again.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:xander=sad,If only I had your confidence.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred,totalFemales:1-3=awkward,All these pretty ladies judging you?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=shy,Is it bad I kinda want to compare?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:xander=awkward,Sorry, as someone who's beaten Donkey Kong many times, I can't relate.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kira=awkward,Guess we're in the same boat there.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=smug,Ah, I see you play on Effortless mode.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy,Hey, that's not so bad. I think we're roughly about the same size...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"... I'm already halfway started anyway...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=stunned,Wow... I'm <i>erect</i> and you're still bigger!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=masturbate_b,Oh... I  do love a good chest...

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot springs lover! That's how I'm getting through this...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=embarrassed,(Maybe I am a little fortunate...)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=sad,How awful.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=stunned,A picture? Where?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma=shy,Just out of curiosity, why <i>are</i> you not wearing anything under there?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tina=shy,A-are they really that great?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,Hahaha~! ~player~ got busted!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,Do you really have to do it so slow? It's killing me...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=beat,Look, I laugh about a lot of things...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=annoyed,Please, just... make this quick...

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:peach=sad,I think I'm feeling a little nervous...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meg=angry,I already told you, didn't I? I don't judge!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=pumped,Time to demask this heroine!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alpha=surprised,You didn't even hesitate to strip? I'm impressed at how brave you are.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou=surprised,Wait, you still have that amulet-
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:asuna=thinking,(Is this a regular thing with prisoners?...<i>Did this happen with Lady Palutena?</i>)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=shy,(Ah... I just noticed the mole... it's kind of cute.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chell=embarrassed,Really? The undershirt before the jumpsuit?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chara=surprised,Maybe you don't, but I do!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=surprised,C-Cool? But your, uh, b-boobs are...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I'll, uh, pass. W-why don't you go help, ~player~?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang=shy,Well, only since you've been hyping it up all game...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ayano=angry,Cheater!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,(Should we give them a nice warm welcome?)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=loss,All of a sudden?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=sad,Sorry, Natsuki... I don't want you exposing yourself any more than you do.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=angry,Really? What tipped you off?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=beat,That just sounds like filth to me...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pearl=surprised,Y-you could've warned us first!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=stunned,Yes, of course! You won't hear a a peep out of me.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lux=shy,Well, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually really curious what Lux has.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lilith=beat,Getting pretty intense here. There are a ton of <i>Sirens</i> going off in my head.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:leela=beat,Lucky them, I guess?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:launch=shy,Sheesh, so aggressive...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,Why would you even mention that...?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=pumped,Don't worry! I don't think you'll disappoint.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=shy,(Poor Nagisa looks like she's about to burst into tears...)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=thinking,You kinda lost me.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=beat,(Hope Viridi never catches wind of this. She'd smite Morrigan herself.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:paya=shy,No... hard... feelings?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?
-2-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheva,marker:palutenacall=thinking,I see no net.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=awkward,A flat chest is fine too.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=sad,That's no different from a guy's chest.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,(Hoping the crowd's attention is off me for a while...)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?

-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:ann=awkward,All I can say is sorry. Ahaha...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=joking,(I'm getting too excited... calm yourself, Pit...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sad,I'm not sure how much more I can take!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,Uh-oh. She can tell if I get hard...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:hifumicomment,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,(There isn't a strip shoji too, is there?)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Who can say for sure?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Lady Palutena isn't your personal razor, you know!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:8=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,(At least I'm not the one being called the creep.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,You didn't deny it, though...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=happy,Huh? Bought what?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led him on!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led her on!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:web=surprised,Has that... ever happened before, or are you just making it up?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised,Waitwaitwaitwait! At least <i>warn</i> us before you go dropping your panties immediately!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,You're telling me!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=beat,Not so much to me...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=embarrassed,Stop teasing us, Neo... please...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,A-At least it can't get any worse for you, right?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=angry,Yes! Please! For all of us here...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:harucomment,alsoPlaying:ann=surprised,Sounds just like me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=joking,Wow, so many puns! I'm proud of you!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=annoyed,Button masher, huh...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=surprised,Oh yeah... she said said she doesn't wear panties...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stunned,Well that's... I mean I... excuse me for one second.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:makotocomment,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,Guess I'm the preachy one instead.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Interesting take.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misty=beat,(I can still hardly believe it's a rule myself. What a game this is.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daisy=awkward,Princesses losing their thongs... this is certainly a unique game.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Yep. So far gone, she's probably in Skyworld.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=beat,Apparently.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:velma=embarrassed,I don't think you've thought this through!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm sorry, but...I'm sure you can do it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=shy,I can hardly believe this myself, Elaine... Is that a tattoo?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,Oh well. I could practically see it all anyway...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=awkward,I can completely understand tradition. But do they all come so small?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=joking,Oh no, I'm not hating! It's just that there's already so much out in the open...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah=surprised,I was just surprised by how much you were showing off. I'm not hating.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,I know it's the point of the game, but you don't have to be so bubbly about it!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=sad,Must be tough. I'm... sorry you have to do this, Pyrrha.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pearl=annoyed,Humans are lustful in nature, Pearl. I'd have thought you'd know this by now. You're probably around my age.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sonya=happy,You wanna finish that sentence?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Wait, why is Nadeshiko naked too?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=sad,Uh oh. This is gonna be messy.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:spooky=annoyed,Stupid rules.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shego=smug,Whatever you say.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=surprised,(Shoot, I'm actually really looking forward to this!)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,No more jokes and no more distrations...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elena=sad,I wish you'd get your deus ex machina, but not even Lady Palutena could help you now.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:piper=sad,O-oh my.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=beat,(I wonder if Ryu ever wanted to see this much of Chun-Li...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:penny=determined,Okay! I swear, I won't look again!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,If there's one good thing to come out of tonight, I'm going to make Cloud super jealous!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ayano=embarrassed,(Don't let it be me, don't let it be me, don't let it be me...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tina=awkward,Ah, you don't need 'em. The game industry is where it's at!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=beat,Your lack of shame baffles me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pauling=thinking,What's the dealer got to do with this?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=devoted,I'm sorry, Uravity... but I'm sure you can do it! You're a hero, after all!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=awkward,On the bright side, you'll be more aerodynamic.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang=smug,I know a thing or two about overconfidence. <i>You</i> were overconfident.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,You only have yourself to blame with all that big talk earlier.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zelda=shy,H-Hang on, I need to get ready.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=calm,There we go, finally almost got you!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou=beat,You <i>really</i> don't want to use the amulet? O-okay then.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=determined,Deep breaths, Natsuki. (And you too, Pit...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon=stunned,You did <i>what</i> to it? That just seems... wrong!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=annoyed,The sex demon's getting naked? Who could've seen this coming?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:monika=devoted,The last piece... the final hit!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,I'll pass... maybe ~player~ would like to help, though.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chica=joking,It could've fooled me...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=calm,I'm happy to oblige.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=awkward,She's right. Trust me, I know a thing or two about minimizing air friction!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=beat,I feel bad for stripping such a nice girl... but it's the game, y'know...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,I still can't believe I'm watching this.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby=loss,This is definitely happening... just don't think about it too hard...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake=angry,I'm not that insensitive.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shazza=joking,Can it really be called a morsel with how much it's covering?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chara=shy,Me neither, Chara. Me neither.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=embarrassed,This is... um...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=awkward,Instead you have strangers like ~player~ to do that for you.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=beat,Yeah, seriously. Some people are so greedy.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sharla=beat,Oh, right. Being naked is an actual strategy in your world.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:asuna=shy,Maybe you can tell me the actual reason someday.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:paya=devoted,I feel incredibly honored to be the first.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=determined,Just remember, it's not over yet. Stay strong.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mileena=beat,*sigh* Great...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:peach=beat,Prepare yourself, Pit. Here comes Peach's... peach.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uhura=awkward,"Little" is one way to put it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:april=shy,As long as you don't tell anyone either.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:riva=happy,Wow. Most action I've seen all night!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,I-It's a bit late for that advice at this point...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=shy,M-Maybe there'll be triple pants?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=shy,They are a bit... um... distracting...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=surprised,Is this a new feeling for you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,Can I get a closer look? Please...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=heavy_c,I know I'm a pervert... but at this point, I don't care...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:no_underwear_surprise=shy,(Honestly, this outcome was one of the better ones for my heart...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:leela=shy,Don't be hard on yourself. You're more developed than any Monoeye I ever fought!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,You're so pretty, ~player~... wait, I mean, it's, uh, okay I guess.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,Is that normally how human girls style... down there?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,It's like opening a treasure box...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=shy,That's.... yeah. Wow. So different from what I expected from you...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human=loss,D-Do you want me to look away? This isn't something an angel should be looking at!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu,marker:puns=shy,It's, uh, how do I put this... Kyu-te.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=embarrassed,I, uh, know what it's like to carry a group. I-It's not fun. (Amazing...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... just like mine...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:4=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetSaidMarker:bikini=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. And what some Federation cares about shouldn't be your priority!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=beat,Saki, there's no need to be so depressing. You're fine!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:riva=thinking,(With how many times she's called us perverts, I almost think she does.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha=embarrassed,I'm sorry! It's not like I want to look!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amy_rose=thinking,No? Well okay then. (Why do I even bother sometimes...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:paya=shy,Neither did I, Paya. Neither. Did. I.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=sad,I could never get used to fighting naked. How do you do it?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=sad,Aww, but I love the booty. N-Not that booty, but...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma=shy,(Again, why couldn't that sweater be just a <i>little</i> bit longer?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=beat,So that's out there now... yep... so, uh... how's it feel?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=shy,I sure hope you'll be okay... you don't have to put on a brave face for us, if you don't want to...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=embarrassed,Oh... uh... is that your natural hair color? ...Not what I was expecting.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aiyana=embarrassed,I'll just try to pretend those tan lines are a swimsuit. Just have to avoid the finer details... like the hair....
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pearl=shy,I agree.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:birthday=annoyed,You're playing a dangerous game...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=awkward,(Still better than the Aurum.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=shy,Wow... that tattoo really covers <i>all over</i>...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:halfway=smug,Not very enthusiastic. Try that again.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:8=annoyed,Can we just kick her out? Please? I don't even think ~player~ likes Revy.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=surprised,W-well, it was messy... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:angie=shy,Might want to watch where you're looking, ~player~. Angie's giving you the stink-eye.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerm=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. He <i>wanted</i> those.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:xander,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=shy,Be careful if you accept that, Xander. She's magic, remember.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:asuna=awkward,H-how'd you guess?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice=shy,S-someone pinch me...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:peach=embarrassed,Oh... now I know why it hurts so much when I get hit by Peach Bomber....
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=stunned,That's just the way it goes, I guess. (But seriously, what was that about a thief?)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lara=shy,I agree one hundred percent.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marceline=embarrassed,Okay, I've had my look, now can we <i>please</i> move on?!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ami=awkward,Coincidentally, junk food <i>is</i> involved in my usual feasting.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee,targetSaidMarker:shave=shy,I thought you were talking about your legs...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=loss,Ow! I can feel that from here.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mara_jade,saidMarker:playerf=smug,No hesitation at all on ~player~'s part. She <i>wanted</i> those.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=embarrassed,I kind of have a similar style... I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> poking, whatever that means.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=surprised,Did you do this... to flirt with us? Well, uh, gotta say, it was kind of effective.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=shy,So this is normal? I wonder if I should shave... then again, it's not like I have someone who'd want to see it...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kim=smug,Don't mind me. Just counting down the rounds until things get worse.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=thinking,... I thought I heard wrong, but Phantom Thief?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uhura=embarrassed,Baby? You... are you making fun of me?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi,alsoPlaying:beatrix=surprised,Nono! I'm sure she's perfectly content with your... female body.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shantae,marker:palutenacall=surprised,So... has anyone ever told you you'd be a great fit for Smash?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=stunned,R-really? Is that all it takes to be considered mature in your world?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:clover=determined,M-Maybe this shouldn't have gone so far, but I won't let anyone die!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,Okay, seriously, how do you expect us to play with... <i>this</i> going on?!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura=shy,Well, I didn't <i>mind</i> the hair. N-Not that I was looking there. I... uh...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Point is, everything's broken.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ciri=shy,Jury's still out on if I'm enjoying this or not.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:florina,count-lyn:1=embarrassed,Y-You didn't shave for someone here, did you?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:orendi=surprised,...Riiiiiiight.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:seven=determined,Maybe not to you, but I'm an angel. I don't get to interact with humans that often, much less like...this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li=embarrassed,(I wouldn't blame him if he did.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tracer=embarrassed,Wow... those tights didn't lie, did they...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,It is a bit of an eyecatcher, huh?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chica=surprised,I've always been curious about the inner workings of robots, but this is too much!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Feeling close?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei=embarrassed,R-right. (I'm getting such a tongue lashing tonight!)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,(Oh man, she looks so cute! Should I say something?) 
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:calisto=joking,Turnabout's fair play, as they say.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that the moon's out.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jubilee=embarrassed,You really didn't have to do that!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=joking,Guess it doesn't really matter anymore, now that you've seen the real thing.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:buffy=shy,Yep... there you are...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=angry,Don't try anything, Ice Cream. I won't go easy on you if you make me your enemy!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,I-In that case, maybe you should cover your body!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=surprised,You said it, not me... stop looking at me like that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake=beat,What a strange night this turned out to be.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=angry,How messed up are you?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pauling=embarrassed,Surely there are other things you should be inspecting, Dealer... like these cards! Yes, you should totally shuffle the deck!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:palutena=shy,Sorry I can't help much with that. I'm no Cupid...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=stunned,Oh! Maybe we can make her dance as her forfeit instead! What do you all think?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:beatrix=awkward,Doesn't mean much when you're divine, either.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayla=embarrassed,Incredible.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:jasmine=shy,G-Good on ya, DMG.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:korra=shy,Hey, the natural look works well on you! You should go around like that more ofte-wait, no! That's not what I meant!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=surprised,What? For... her?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:black_canary=shy,I'll just take your word on that.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:link=smug,Oh, Link. Really?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=angry,Look at what you've done. Did you really have to humiliate Yang like that?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=sad,Well, I had hoped...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Trust me, Asuna. Not all men care about how you keep... there trimmed.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=shy,C-come on Rinkah...W-where's that Fire Tribe pride?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah=angry,Well, if you're gonna call me <i>that</i>, then it's on!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mei=embarrassed,It's like a... bear in hibernation? Sorry, my analogies still need work.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=awkward,Man, I'm jealous of you two. Wish I had a friend I trusted enough to take naked selfies with. Or to have a friend at all.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,What a waste of magic. We have tools for a reason, you know.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=annoyed,Phew... I wasn't the only one bothered by her.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:willow=awkward,Yep. All of you. No more to see. Ehehe...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia=joking,Yeah, that bodysuit didn't actually leave much to the imagination.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:asuna,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=awkward,And you probably shouldn't.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chiaki=sad,If only there were one-ups in this game...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chell=thinking,I believe the saying goes "there's no sense crying over every mistake"?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=joking,Hey now! We're <i>all</i> weird, Futaba.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Yes, we can all see that!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=pumped,You want to take out Lady Palutena, you have to get through me first!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=shy,Fine by me, Launch. Back to the game.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Maybe you should back off, Mahiru. Not sure a superhero like her wants her naked picture taken...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=embarrassed,(As much as I don't want to admit it, she does have a really nice body. I guess it makes sense she'd want to flaunt it.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,N-now's not the time for that! Save it for the forfeit if you have to...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:piper=shy,I take it shaving isn't very common in your world.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:jane,alsoPlayingStage:3=shy,P-please don't do any spanking in here. It's bad enough you're naked!

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=sad,How are you taking this so well...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Say, Lady Palutena, would my hair turn gold if I had light powers too?

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad,Please don't do that again...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shego=beat,Thankfully, eyes don't count as another stage.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=smug,If you're going to cheat and get two extra safety nets, you should've at least <i>kept them.</i>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:d.va=shy,(There it is, just staring at me... yep.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elena=beat,Geez, hope you at least get your clothes back after this. Hate to see you go home like that.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=embarrassed,I've, uh, never seen you down there, Ms. Fit. I think that's a bit more important than Sonya's workout routine right now...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daphne=embarrassed,While you're naked? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:3-4=embarrassed,D-don't remind me...

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tina=shy,I'd let you, but I'm obligated to see this game to the end.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=awkward,H-Hey, there's no shame in shaving!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena_classic=embarrassed,Nothing bad, I hope.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,T-That's a bit too much info!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=embarrassed,You take this so lightly... are you even playing the game seriously?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:5=joking,You will! It's a last man standing game, after all!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jane=angry,Hey, be nice everyone!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo=embarrassed,I thought I was ready, but did you really have to go and do <i>that</i>?!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shy,I'll take what you're offering. (Wait, you're getting distracted, Pit!)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina,totalNaked:5=shy,I, uh, hope me being a naked guy doesn't intimidate you.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey,totalMales:4=awkward,Must be awkward to be the only girl. More so than usual, I mean.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=annoyed,Fine. If you're that passionate about it, I'll just stare at your ankles or something.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,totalMales:4=beat,What, you don't like being the only girl?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shazza=awkward,I guess you're cute, <i>as</i> a dingo.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=shy,Y'know, surrounded by all these guys, this is a bresh of freath-er, breath of fresh air. Doesn't even feel <i>completely</i> awkward.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko,totalNaked:5=embarrassed,I feel like I've seen this somewhere before.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:yuri=joking,Seems there's a split opinion in the literature club.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sonya=embarrassed,No, I... just need a moment...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,At least it was just an illusion.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hermione=embarrassed,Can you check? I feel like I'll faint at any second...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=surprised,(These two would make a weird team.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gogo=loss,Don't do that. Please...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=beat,You really should have worn something else... you realize you'll have to go home like that, right?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,Y-Yes, I can see that. Can you, uh, cover up, maybe?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=annoyed,Look at what you've done. Apologize to Ruby!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:faye=shy,I was curious if your hair matched, but... never mind.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,C-Cruel? What have I done?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheva=angry,You brought it to yourself by taunting them with those herbs!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda,alsoPlaying:hermione=beat,You're a pretty powerful magician yourself, Zelda. And it's against the rules, anyway.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=embarrassed,I don't want to know what <i>either</i> of those do! Can I vote 'neither'?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:monika=shy,Wow, ~player~'s really enjoying this from what I can see. But I can't tell if it's a scared look or an aroused one...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:zoey=embarrassed,Don't shame her, Zoey. A-And that's not something you should be admitting so lightly!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:evie=embarrassed,Did I do something wrong...?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Surprise, you're both filthy!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=beat,Corrin's too nice to brag. I'm sure he'll be a gentleman about this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:shantae=awkward,Maybe you should've been the dancer of Corrin's army instead of that blue lady.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:harley=beat,So... uh... cute grooming down there?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,...Blake?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:spooky=smug,I'm not scared of death! I beat the god of it, after all!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,(Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight.)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,I bet she feels really soft to the touch...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,So, uh... go team RWBY?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=joking,Those buns are toastier than I expected, actually.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=sad,(What an angel I turned out to be...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=happy,I'm hopping on the Ladybottom train too!... N-not in <i>that</i> way, but... you know what I mean...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=beat,I wouldn't trust her not to brag. She gets preeeetty competitive.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jura,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:9=victory,The V-sign is great! I wish it was used more, but I'm glad you two are using it!

-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:xander=smug,This is exactly how I saw it going!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:fred=smug,Really? That twitchy scowl says otherwise.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=smug,And you're finally removing your shirt.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:kira=thinking,(What is he saying?)
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=thinking,Lower the intensity level?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=beat,Pretty nifty coat there. Very detailed.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,I may be a fan of robots and stuff, but I don't love them like <i>that</i>!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=joking,Whatever you say, buddy.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:link=pumped,Isn't <i>this</i> fantastic? I won't tell Nintendo, but you better believe I'm telling everyone back home!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=surprised,Oh! The shirt now?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,It's almost impressive how wrong that sentence was, Futaba.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin=joking,"Joy" is probably an overstatement...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryu=beat,That's understandable. It's like how I don't want to part with my laurel crown.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:caleb=smug,I'm sure you're well-toned enough.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=happy,Finally removing the tunic. I'm gonna time it, to see how long you take!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=smug,Oh, you're comfortable with this, are you?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:link=smug,Yeah, sorry, that ain't working anymore.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:kira=awkward,Oh good. I thought you wouldn't speak English again.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:shaggy=angry,You're not an ostrich!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_america=pumped,You'll just have to fight to keep your clothes on!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin=happy,Impressive! I'm still working on getting a set myself.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:xander=sad,If only I had your confidence.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=sad,Wish I could grow chest hair like that...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=happy,Finally, a realistic robot frame!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,I mean, I guess you're as toned as the average human soldier...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,Dang, didn't peg you as the type to keep fit.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=beat,You're no Magnus, but you're not too shabby.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=happy,You ever go to the hot springs? Surely you've used them before.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:human=victory,I've definitely seen worse. Even from the gods themselves.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Sorry. I, uh, don't swing that way.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=stunned,Wow, that only took you two minutes. Impressive.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred=awkward,~player~ judging you?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:fred,totalFemales:1-3=awkward,All these pretty ladies judging you?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=beat,I'm pretty happy. This is how a robot <i>should</i> look undressed.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=angry,Don't change the subject!
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryu=awkward,You have a point there, Ryu.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:mettaton=shy,Your creator has, um... interesting tastes.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,(Will ~player~'s crotch differ a lot from mine?)
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=annoyed,Well, best get it out of the way.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I have <i>zero</i> expectations.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mettaton=surprised,You were throwing? I never even noticed!
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:xander=awkward,Sorry, as someone who's beaten Donkey Kong many times, I can't relate.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryu=annoyed,Let's just make this as fast as possible.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s=stunned,Are you saying you actually have...hardware down there?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:caleb=annoyed,I'll, uh, just look over here.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=beat,That makes two of us.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shaggy,alsoPlaying:alpha=happy,Lighting's already not so great. But we could use a spooky organ, yeah. Mind playing something, Alpha?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_america=surprised,I'd prefer to see your face, but clearly I'm in the minority.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kira=awkward,Guess we're in the same boat there.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:captain_falcon=loss,So you <i>are</i> keeping the scarf... so then...
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=thinking,Does that even really count as a trick?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=joking,If it makes you feel better, everyone here isn't judging... too harshly.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:fred=calm,Remember when you said it was hot in here? I do.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=surprised,...Stay away from me.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin=beat,Have you never taken your clothes off? That seems like something you should know.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smug,*snicker*
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:fred=joking,Is that a euphamism? ...Actually, I don't want to know.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=beat,That's cruel, Nugi-chan. ~player~ can't help who he is.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,I'm... sure it's just the cold.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Oh! There's... not much.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,At least I won't have to see it out of the corner of my eye.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Poor guy. You were too small for your britches.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Did you really want to come here to show that off? Why?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=annoyed,Good gravy.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=smug,Bigger than I expected. Not bad.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,I mean, I think mine's around the same size, so...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,You're definitely bigger than the centurions. Might even be around my size.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=happy,Pretty decent, actually.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human=thinking,Are you average for a human? Smaller? ...Bigger?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s=sad,So you weren't a true robot after all...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=shy,I don't remember this from the DLC...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander=devoted,I'm not <i>that</i> mean. I'll save the mocking for after I win!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=shy,I <i>am</i> enjoying this. I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt to "get to know you two better"...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_falcon=smug,Really? You're not circumcised? Even I am, and I'm an angel!
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:caleb=beat,Er, right. Next is the forfeit for you, right?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:xander,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Typical.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:9s,alsoPlaying:futaba=awkward,She is a bit strange, isn't she?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin=shy,I could go for one, yeah.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=beat,Way ahead of you, Cappy.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:mettaton=embarrassed,The real plot twist was that that tiny pair of underwear was actually a pocket dimension!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryu=surprised,How the-? What sort of magic is this?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:shaggy=surprised,Okay, that's a little <i>too</i> spooky.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kira=shy,So passive aggressive...
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Dang, what have you been eating? And where can I get some?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=joking,That... doesn't look so healthy.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=surprised,Are you okay? That looks... swollen.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=beat,Sheesh, that practically qualifies as a third leg...
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:human=awkward,Looks like someone took "talk soft and carry a big stick" literally.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mei=beat,Right, tell me when to turn back around, okay?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lara=calm,I bet they have.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:streaming-chan=loss,Do you really have to do it so slow? It's killing me...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=annoyed,Yeah. Gravity's just all kinds of blegh.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato=surprised,W-Why would I do that? I'm not the type of angel you're probably used to. I'm a good guy!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tifa=awkward,Hahaha~! ~player~ got busted!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Well, this'll be a <i>new</i> experience for me.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tina=shy,A-are they really that great?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=thinking,Is a magic battle about to start?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:monika=beat,She's all yours, buddy.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer=smug,You also <i>have</i> no more sleeves.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=awkward,Y'know, because you both have blue hair.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=beat,Something tells me the audience behind that camera is seeing something they've seen before.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uravity=shy,Yeah, I bet. Take all the time you need.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma=shy,Just out of curiosity, why <i>are</i> you not wearing anything under there?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:moon=annoyed,It's like, even when we win, she wins.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:paya=shy,No... hard... feelings?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:velma_classic=stunned,A picture? Where?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:videl=smug,Hope you're ready, Videl. Your hubris came back to bite you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,Maybe just start practicing in the nude?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:morrigan=beat,(Hope Viridi never catches wind of this. She'd smite Morrigan herself.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:palutena=beat,Oh man... you're losing pretty badly too! Not a good day for Skyworld.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=beat,Avert your eyes, Ruby. You shouldn't see your sister like this.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=sad,If I was really fortunate, I'd still be in the game.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot springs lover! That's how I'm getting through this...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li=shy,So here we go. They're getting unbound.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=pumped,Don't worry! I don't think you'll disappoint.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=shy,(Poor Nagisa looks like she's about to burst into tears...)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misato,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,I feel the exact same, Misato. Revy isn't someone you want to strip for.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meg=angry,I already told you, didn't I? I don't judge!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=beat,Look, I laugh about a lot of things...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sonya=smug,Not so tough, are you?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=shy,Not so much to me...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,I'll keep my expectations in check.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:may=loss,Urgh...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stunned,Wow. Just... wow.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette=pumped,Time to demask this heroine!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mercy=shy,Oh. I guess it's good Lady Palutena doesn't wear one?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,My thoughts exactly, Hope.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=smug,And now, Mia's final piece of evidence.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I'll, uh, pass. W-why don't you go help, ~player~?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:5=shy,She does have a point, but don't be afraid to take your time.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=loss,All of a sudden?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mileena=smug,Me neither, lady. Me neither.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=happy,She's not wrong, Revy.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty=stunned,That sounds... degrading.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=stunned,Yes, of course! You won't hear a a peep out of me.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:9=smug,Of course! Lady Palutena is the nicest person in the world!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lyn=sad,Dang. That's... heavy.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:peach=sad,I think I'm feeling a little nervous...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,For her, maybe. But not fair in general.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=smug,On the other hand, maybe she'd learn to tone it down. I'm just saying, I won't stop you if you open fire.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shy,At least we've all seen 90% of them already.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lux=shy,Well, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually really curious what Lux has.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:penny=loss,Got it. I'll do my best to not look.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lilith=beat,Getting pretty intense here. There are a ton of <i>Sirens</i> going off in my head.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Hey now! Diversity is a key element of Overwatch.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:leela=beat,Lucky them, I guess?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=beat,That's more you being brash than anything.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:launch=shy,Sheesh, so aggressive...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:buffy=embarrassed,(She's sure taking her time. What're they gonna look like?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ciri=surprised,I see. (Maybe that's why Lady Palutena's trying to get me to wear tighter shorts?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dawn=shy,B-but my Pokedex is already complete!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,marker:puns=joking,Heh. By coming out of the binds, now you're <i>in</i> a bind!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elaine=awkward,I think this is what you call karma.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice=shy,I'll try my best not to stare.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=shy,(She practically lives in Skyworld, so out of everyone, she's the least taboo to look at right?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=beat,So your vulgarity isn't just restricted to colorful language. Great.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:evie,marker:puns=pumped,You should've known to layer up in the cold!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:faye=smug,This ought to be good, with how much you've been teasing the rest of us.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl=joking,I guess you could say we're bringing light to your Dark Magician Girls.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=shy,This is so weird...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina=calm,The fact you made it this far certainly counts for something. You're almost there.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba=annoyed,(If she's so smart, maybe she should've taken off her headphones instead of taking her boobs out.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daphne=beat,As much as I hate to say it, you're right about that.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=joking,Well, I can't blame you for helping her, Nadeshiko. I'd do the same if Lady Palutena asked.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gogo=surprised,What kind of logic is that?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:harley=shy,I just want to see if you really painted <i>everywhere</i>.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hermione=stunned,<i>The</i> Viktor Krum?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pyrrha=stunned,Oh? You were a model, Pyrrha?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=joking,Looks like you're the center of attention now. And for good reason.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daria=thinking,(I get the feeling this'll be less exciting than I'm making it out to be.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:riva=awkward,Two chances, if we're counting...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,You really don't have to! There's a lot of other choices!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayla=annoyed,Still think it should count as one piece...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Wha?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei=surprised,Good. <i>Good.</i>
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki=sad,I'm...sorry to hear that. But someone here will want to, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:seven=devoted,I'm just glad I'm fortunate enough to still have my clothes!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,(That top was already pretty small...how bad can this be?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sharla,marker:palutenacall=awkward,At least your clothes give you defensive bonuses. I could fight naked and be as right as rain... not that I'd ever do that!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=stunned,Huh... w-where does it go?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shazza=shy,That time already... where did it go...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shego,marker:palutenacall=devoted,Was that meant to be insulting? Because it's almost flattering.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=stunned,Never expected to lose? Don't you know, like, three people who'd trounce us all?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby=shy,This will be our little secret... you won't tell anyone I was here too, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:piper=beat,The gods don't wear bras, so can't help you there. And, you know, guy.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:korra=beat,It <i>is</i> kinda hard to believe...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aella=shy,This is nothing... no worse than Dark Lord Gaol. You actually look a lot like her, too.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:rosalina=surprised,Why do you look so happy about this?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,(I'm really going to see Samus's chest... is this real life?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=thinking,(These fruits are probably poisoned.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,That went pretty high. Are you sure that'll work?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:hope=shy,...Hope? Are you fine?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=annoyed,Please, just... make this quick...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human=thinking,Anyone want to bet what size she'll be? I honestly can't tell.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena_classic=devoted,Don't feel bad! Just channel your inner hot spring lover!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zelda=determined,(Princess Zelda is a graceful woman, worthy of respect. Don't be creepy.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:asuna=thinking,(Is this a regular thing with prisoners?...<i>Did this happen with Lady Palutena?</i>)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ayano=angry,Cheater!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:beatrix=shy,I've seen my fair share of small busts, but I wouldn't consider plain marble to be all that arousing.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang=shy,Well, only since you've been hyping it up all game...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=thinking,Are you okay over there? You seem annoyed more than anything.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie=beat,Honestly, I'd rather see the monkey... it'd be less embarrassing for all of us.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=determined,(Here they come... brace for impact!)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=joking,That's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an angel, but aside from the wings, I'm anatomically human.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:willow=shy,(Should we give them a nice warm welcome?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=shy,Yes... really.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:calisto=shy,It was exposed before, but I guess it's gonna be super exposed now...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale=surprised,C-Cool? But your, uh, b-boobs are...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chara=surprised,Maybe you don't, but I do!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chell=embarrassed,Really? The undershirt before the jumpsuit?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=shy,(Ah... I just noticed the mole... it's kind of cute.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=happy,I'll take it! C'mon guys, take the money!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chica=beat,This is some grade-A nightmare fuel.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake=shy,I'll just look at your ears instead. You don't mind that, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:annie_leonhart=embarrassed,Wait! I'm not ready yet!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va_cruiser=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou=surprised,Wait, you still have that amulet-
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=awkward,It can't be that bad, can it?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=shy,So... here they come. (What little there is to show, at least.)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jura=annoyed,This is a fake-out, right? I don't trust you.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheva,marker:palutenacall=thinking,I see no net.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri=surprised,This went from zero to a hundred <i>really fast</i>!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kim=thinking,...Why were they the first things that came to mind?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=shy,You <i>did</i> know the rules of the Inventory, right?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pearl=surprised,Y-you could've warned us first!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen=beat,Canon is weird. Like how I'm an angel who can't fly.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:daisy=beat,"Goodies" is certainly one word for it...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:elena=pumped,Even now, you're still respecting the rules. How commendable!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=shy,How do I change the channel?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:d.va=sad,It's hard to keep up <i>my</i> game face.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alpha=surprised,You didn't even hesitate to strip? I'm impressed at how brave you are.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ami=smug,You've got a lot of confidence... not very modest, huh?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zoey=shy,More like AO.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=smug,Sorry. This isn't anything personal.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:angie=beat,I understand how you feel... I don't do to well in these situations, either.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ann=shy,I hope this isn't something you've done before, Ann.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jane=smug,Feeling the pain, Jane?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pauling=surprised,Nooo trouble at all for you, huh?
-1-female_removing_major,target:clover,targetStage:3=thinking,(Hm? Does Clover know ~player~ at all?)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:weiss=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=beat,That just sounds like filth to me...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,Why are there suddenly two Rubys?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:revy=angry,Hey! Revy! Shut up and let her do this! She doesn't need you jeering at her!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-what did I just tell you?!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:clover,targetStage:5=angry,Right? That's what I've been wondering!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=beat,This is quickly going into hardcore territory.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2=angry,Stay back! I'm ready for it this time!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=determined,It's time to stop guessing and start doing.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=calm,Got no more tricks, huh?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,You're a lot bustier than I thought... and... blonde?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Good thing I'm here, huh?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=beat,I'm glad Viridi hasn't caught wind of this game, or she'd probably kill you for what you're doing right now.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki=thinking,You kinda lost me.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:4=shy,Pretty sure that's more than nothing that's going!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:3=surprised,Why are you so casual about this? You're a princess, aren't you?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:ruby=loss,Ouch. Your own team has to see you like this...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kurumu,alsoPlaying:twilight=angry,You do <i>not</i> need to be on that report. Ignore her, Twilight.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=angry,Really? What tipped you off?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:gwenom=shy,This went to an interesting place.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:6=shy,It's fine... they've been half-out for a while anyway...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=smug,Isn't it obvious? She uses stardust for fuel, like the other space pirates!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=shy,I-is that supposed to be Yang? That's a pretty good impression.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=shy,I'm waiting with bated breath.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=loss,(I pray that I never end up in a "flash".)
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=determined,I'm sorry, Mahiru. But you can do this!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:0=sad,Sorry, Natsuki... I don't want you exposing yourself any more than you do.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=joking,Maybe just think of it like a trip to the hot springs.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,Why would you even mention that...?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=beat,What's it gonna be like... do you know, Blake?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:joey,targetStage:4=shy,O-Oh.. so you're leaving your hat on...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:uhura,targetStage:5=stunned,Even the body suit is regulated? Yeesh.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi=awkward,To be honest, it was barely there in the first place...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=thinking,Did... Neo just turn into a different person?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=awkward,It's a really complicated process that involves a copy of Pokemon Red or Blue. I'll tell you about it after the game.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=beat,Well, there wasn't any space rum on the <i>last</i> space pirate ship I raided...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=annoyed,So is Juri just living out some sort of pervy cop-and-criminal fantasy?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:elena=shy,We both got screwed pretty badly, didn't we?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,Goes kind of beyond simple bonding, but sure.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby=embarrassed,Hey, small is good! It's nice and compact.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=determined,Tell your viewers to watch closely! I won't lose to the likes of you!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=shy,(A-Adorable...)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=shy,A-again, intimidation doesn't work on me...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=shy,This is going to be an interesting forfeit...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kim=shy,(A bit smaller than she looked.)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:d.va=happy,You don't know the half of it! D.va's amazing.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=beat,It's not bad that I'm rooting for Raven here, is it?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,Y-yeah, sure thing.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss=shy,(A-Adorable...)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,Do I even want to know about that?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:6-9=awkward,Ha! Called out!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jubilee=joking,Fair enough. This is better on me, too.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:videl=annoyed,Hmph! Thought you were clever?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=awkward,More like sibling bonds, but sure.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,marker:puns=joking,Not much cleavage, is there?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:misty=shy,I'm not looking! Oh, what's that over there, away from Misty? Let's have a look!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:samus=beat,I doubt you're on her list, Pearl. She would've bagged you already.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=shy,But this is no laughing matter.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zizou=stunned,That's not directed at me is it? I'll have you know these are one-hundred percent real clothes. Touch them if you don't believe me.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=awkward,Kind of a weird idea of bonding, but sure.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:chell=shy,Guess you're bolder than I gave you credit for.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:hairy1,targetNotSaidMarker:shave1=stunned,How come? Don't be nervous, you're in good company.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=shy,Now that that's all decided, let's move on, okay?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:riva=annoyed,Fine, but not because you told me too or anything...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Cherries? (Way to point that out. Now I'm hungry on top of everything else.)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,Y-yeah, I see. (Say something, Pit! Don't just stammer!)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=embarrassed,Oh! D-Don't worry, I'll be gentle with them- <i>n-no, I mean I'll be nice to them!</i> I-I wasn't planning on touching them or anything! I'm so sorry...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:alpha=thinking,The nipples are still pink? Surprising.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou=devoted,Don't be so shy... I feel lucky to have even seen <i>this</i> much of a goddess!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:streaming-chan=shy,They won't lose to you! Even if I have...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=awkward,I'm sure you'll get your growth spurt some time.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=devoted,Don't be embarrassed! Even the gods can still be flat!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=joking,There's probably a lot of perks to having them small, you know.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Don't feel bad, ~name~. They're great.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Weird to think we're almost the same chest size...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:beatrix=smug,I'm not the staring type. And even if I <i>was</i>, Lady Palutena's magic is better than any op-whatever could be at fixing strain.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:jane=embarrassed,Ahem! Yes, well, let's just move on, okay?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=shy,So this is what an Inkling looks like...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:shazza=awkward,No, see, 'Sheila' is slang for-wait, don't change the subject! You're stealing my job!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:daisy=joking,I can certainly say you're not Peach now.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:rinkah=shy,What was that laugh?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=shy,(I'll just leave out how I'm screaming internally.)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:calisto=smug,I see you're not giving up. Just what I'd expect from a lawyer of your caliber.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:dawn=happy,Ah, covering them with your hair! Smart!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:sonya=annoyed,You've got some weird priorities, Sonya.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:not_1st,totalExposed:1=devoted,But, uh... y-you did great! Seriously!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:meg=annoyed,You've made that extensively clear.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=beat,Is that a bad thing? Seriously, I don't know Australian slang.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:alice=embarrassed,What is that? A piercing? I was staring, wasn't I? Sorry.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=awkward,Oh... she's back to normal.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=thinking,Or is she just smitten with Chun-Li?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,So much for that line of conversation.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:9=stunned,F-freckles?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=shy,Oh... I guess you need more practice, Joey.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,You didn't have to do that, you know...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,targetStage:6=surprised,Okay, okay! I'm sorry...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:gwen=happy,Isn't making friends such a wonderful feeling?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=horny,(She looks really cute in a over-the-shoulders pose.)
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:gogo=shy,On... your back? Don't put that image in my head.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=smug,Meia has a point. Don't slack on staying fit!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,Amazing... that's all I can say, ~player~.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=embarrassed,They... suit you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=shy,I might've taken a few peeks. Sorry.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=stunned,Woah... they look even bigger than I imagined. N-Not that I was imagining them!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human=determined,They're very nice. ...Uh, right. Next hand.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=awkward,She's a bit busy at the moment. She has her own hands.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=shy,(Be glad Dr. Mario doesn't know about here.)
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:6=awkward,Well, that jacket was pretty bulky...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,Yep, you got it.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:7=stunned,Freckles?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:4-6=annoyed,You're all getting on my nerves, actually.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=awkward,I'm impressed you managed to get the chest as big as Yang's before.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=shy,I'm not saying that. (Though I'm also not complaining.)
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=embarrassed,Ouch. I could feel that set in from here.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=shy,And, uh, looks like you're finally getting to the "Love Fairy" stuff? ...I'm sorry, I'm bad at small talk.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=surprised,Again. Wow.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:hope=embarrassed,I mean, I'll take your word for it... but you don't seem very hopeful.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:daria=stunned,Oh, like a Boo?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia=surprised,...I have no words.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:raven=surprised,Aren't you a heroine, Raven? Resist!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=shy,You wouldn't think a criminal- who's probably wanted- would want to show off so much...

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:seven=shy,Lady Palutena told me something similar, but I think she actually <i>did</i> have this in mind...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=awkward,Do you want to know the answer?.... It's no.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zoey=determined,We're both the type to not look back, Zoey. So... let's do it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ciri=awkward,Good thing this isn't Gwent then.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayla=sad,Maybe this is nothing to you, but to me, this is... this is...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led them on!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I've always been told shaving cats was a bad thing... but I guess it's different if she does it to herself...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:black_canary=joking,Me? Make a pun? Never!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shantae=shy,I mean...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:samus=surprised,This is all going so fast! At least let me catch my breath before you go whipping it out!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:buffy=happy,Ha ha! I get it!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sonya=happy,You wanna finish that sentence?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang=smug,I know a thing or two about overconfidence. <i>You</i> were overconfident.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=shy,I-I see...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,totalFemales:4=shy,I promise it won't be that bad. I'm not the staring type.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,I-It's a bit late for that advice at this point...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,A-At least it can't get any worse for you, right?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,targetSaidMarker:shave1,targetNotSaidMarker:hairy1=happy,That's the spirit! The rest of us are in the same boat, so just relax...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:drapes=joking,I'm not saying it's weird, just interesting.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetNotSaidMarker:shave=thinking,I would say TMI, but we're far past that point now.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:web=surprised,Has that... ever happened before, or are you just making it up?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:sarcasm=happy,Huh? Bought what?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,alsoPlaying:chiaki,alsoPlayingStage:8=stunned,Really? Even though you're both... underdressed?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led him on!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:misato,saidMarker:playerm=sad,Way to ruin the surprise. I bet ~player~ would have looked priceless if you led her on!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:moon,targetSaidMarker:moon_doesnt_wear_panties=surprised,Oh yeah... she said said she doesn't wear panties...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan,targetSaidMarker:nugi-chan_blames_ai=smug,Usually it's the player's fault, not the game.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=joking,I have a feeling we're better off not knowing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity,targetSaidMarker:art_class=embarrassed,That sounds...yikes. I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment even imagining it...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=happy,I told you that taking off so much would come back to bite you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:orendi=shy,C-commando? Gonna be quite the reveal...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=angry,Hey, at least you have the advantage of stripping through an avatar! Think how the rest of us feel!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:angie=surprised,Why do I feel like you're about to punch someone?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:corrin_f=awkward,You and me both, Corrin.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:leela=happy,Oh, so we're feeling the exact same right now.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va=embarrassed,(I hope she forgot that I'm a fan of hers...)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba=stunned,You doing okay there? Do you... want any help?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=thinking,Seems French doesn't click with you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-yang:1=angry,This has been weird from the get-go!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=surprised,Uh-oh. She can tell if I get hard...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lux=awkward,You <i>could</i> always run away, but that wouldn't be very noble, I guess.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lyn=shy,Over the years, I've gotten used to blocking your attacks...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:2=embarrassed,This isn't that type of game, Nugi-chan!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amy_rose=shy,You could always fall back on the headband if you want.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck=shy,You probably don't want me to look, huh? I understand.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mahiru=surprised,Wait, really? What's the story behind that?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mara_jade=awkward,Lucky you, ~player~.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,Don't say that like it's nothing!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mercy=happy,Thanks for the health tip! But, uh, it doesn't really help me at all...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-weiss:1=awkward,(At least I'm not the one being called the creep.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=awkward,Yeah, with how many plants you've killed tonight, you're definitely not in the Forces of Nature.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=angry,Yes! Please! For all of us here...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:harucomment,alsoPlaying:ann=surprised,Sounds just like me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:sei=annoyed,Button masher, huh...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:makotocomment,alsoPlaying:ann=awkward,Guess I'm the preachy one instead.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=beat,You didn't deny it, though...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:gwen=embarrassed,So... uh... how's it hanging?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:elaine=beat,How honorable. And not at all pirate-like.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:futaba,targetSaidMarker:hifumicomment,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,(There isn't a strip shoji too, is there?)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei=beat,Interesting take.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa,alsoPlaying:marinette=angry,Don't talk like that! You're plenty cute! (...Did I just say that out loud?)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina,alsoPlaying:lyn=shy,Maybe Lyn's your bad luck charm. Or maybe good?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,What is that pose you're making?!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:ruby=shy,...Ruby?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:weiss=embarrassed,Stop teasing us, Neo... please...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:bodysuit,targetNotSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=angry,Lady Palutena isn't your personal razor, you know!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang=embarrassed,...Yang?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:revy=surprised,Why'd you tell her? She'll probably just make fun of you more!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=stunned,Well that's... I mean I... excuse me for one second.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Who can say for sure?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprised,Waitwaitwaitwait! At least <i>warn</i> us before you go dropping your panties immediately!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=surprised,Huh? They were so tight! Why'd they just drop?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,There's really only one way this could've gone.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ruby,count-blake:1=shy,(Hope I don't pass off as a creep.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:ruby=determined,You really should look away. Your sister'd probably like that.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake=shy,...No time like the present?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:sonya=awkward,That'd just look silly.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I agree... the Dealer shuld have confiscated it, or something.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:sayla,alsoPlayingStage:8=shy,Sorry, Sayla. Plenty of other places to look, though.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang=thinking,Why are you looking at her like that, Yang?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee,alsoPlaying:korra=surprised,I think you're messing with it a little too much. This could be a recipe for disaster!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:neo=surprised,That's... really bad, actually. Is this girl a psycho?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=surprised,Come again? Thief?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette,targetSaidMarker:loss2_stage7=embarrassed,I dunno if this counts as great or terrible luck...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:videl=beat,Welp. Here it comes.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lara=thinking,Again, do those count as, um, knickers?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jura=smug,Then this is it. Right? Finally getting to the end?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=surprised,The way you say that makes me think you <i>wanted</i> this.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hermione=awkward,Hehe... I'll never say a word to him.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:harley=thinking,Really, would anyone save you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:clover=sad,It's really unbelievable. But at least you'll get to see others naked too.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kim=annoyed,I take it that's not your typical s'mores and tents type of camp.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jubilee=beat,Yeah, that's a pretty accurate summary of what's happening.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:hope=determined,Don't worry. I'm sure you can do this.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mia=shy,They are a bit... um... distracting...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo=shy,Okay, here we go... get ready Pit...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aiyana=shy,(At least she can't see if I <i>am</i> as turned on as her.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=thinking,I can't tell if that's the weirdest or the best euphemism for down there I've ever heard.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nugi-chan=annoyed,After the stunt with the bandages, I wonder...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jasmine=thinking,Isn't that common sense, or something?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alpha=shy,Sorry, even I can't help a hologram out of this mess.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=happy,Oh, are we breaking script? Maybe I should say something dirty since no one will ever see this...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gogo=annoyed,And now you're not even being subtle.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:evie=beat,Knickers? Dunno what those are, but I'll keep my distance.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=thinking,(There was never a point to turn back, was there?)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jane=beat,I'll trust her at her word.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=awkward,Your last item... I hope it's worth it.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So you <i>are</i> cool with it?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human=shy,So... you're good? Need anything?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:korra=sad,(She looks so sad. I wish I could cheer her up somehow.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kurumu=annoyed,Tsukune can have it. I won't complain.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=surprised,Is this a new feeling for you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:weiss_v4=surprised,If you're uncomfortable with me looking, I'll look away. I'm not evil.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=pumped,All I need on my lonely nights is my Bow and a shooting range, but thanks for the offer.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daphne=joking,Wow, so many puns! I'm proud of you!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:revy=determined,So you're doing it after all... not that I'm surprised, but still.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rinkah,targetNotSaidMarker:tina,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=beat,Not so much to me...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=shy,M-Maybe there'll be triple pants?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheva=smug,You're just getting what you deserve.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=awkward,Sorry Paella, we all have to stick to the rules... hardcore as they are.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:mei=shy,(Everyone says she comes from the Underworld, but I don't see it at all.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marceline=shy,I-if you insist...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn=thinking,(It had come come across my mind once or twice.)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meg=smug,No threats this time? You're learning!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:meia=shy,It's almost over...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chell=shy,Um, maybe you don't want to hear it from me, but chin up!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:florina=awkward,And to think you almost ran away at the start of the game.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:may=awkward,Oh, a fellow stretchy-pants-only enthusiast.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=smug,We'll... uh... see about that, won't we?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice=thinking,I dunno, a dream is the only way I could this whole event happening.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ami=stunned,This... isn't the type of feasting I'm used to.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:marinette=beat,Maybe so. Besides, Hawk Moth is a dumb name for a villain. It's like he pulled two words out of a hat.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=smug,I don't doubt that, but without it, you're just making empty threats.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:annie=surprised,Your favorite pair? This isn't a special occasion, is it?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=joking,Peaks and valleys, highs and lows.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:2-5=annoyed,You know what else it isn't hard with? Actual tools.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=beat,I bet. I hear it's pretty rough out there.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang=awkward,Gotta admit, feels good to bring down such a cock-sure opponent.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:april=stunned,That goes beyond redhead. That could give Pyrrhon a run for his money with how fiery it is!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5=calm,And there's nothing wrong with that, DMG.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:pyrrha=determined,Right! I won't say anything if you won't either!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=shy,I hear humans like to watch "naked oil wrestling". Judging from how casual you're taking this, is that something you two do?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zizou=horny,(T-Thank you Lady Palutena for this amazing sight. I never thought I'd get to see a goddess's butt!)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:6=shy,Yeah. It's red.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:9=annoyed,Sheesh. Amateurs. How wasteful can you get?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Does it really? ...Maybe I should try it. Just once.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:tifa,totalAlive:1-4=embarrassed,Where were you these past few rounds?!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=shy,I haven't seen any myself, to be blunt.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=surprised,...Crud.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mercy=embarrassed,I always appreciate people my fans. But this is definitely a new form of appreciation!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl,marker:palutenacall=embarrassed,So, uh, how's the weather up there? Cold?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meg=beat,So... um... right.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:marinette=shy,All your secrets are laid bare... just like mine. Hehe...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=awkward,It is a bit of an eyecatcher, huh?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=surprised,You seriously had to promise yourself that?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=embarrassed,This is one type of attack I <i>can't</i> block!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lyn=angry,And the pop-up's back!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=annoyed,What even is this woman...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Not really much of a Dawn anymore, now that two Moons are out.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=victory,Never did I think I'd get to see one of my comic book heroines naked. Today was a good day.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:5=awkward,That's pretty good, not gonna lie. Might have to use that one.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2=shy,Now's not really the time to talk about painful stuff.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=angry,Okay, seriously! What is a Phantom Thief?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misty=surprised,Ah! Please don't yell...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ayano=shy,(I'm not ready for that type of commitment. And she's not my type.)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:misato=embarrassed,Y-You're taking on this "fanservice" role way too well!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mileena=calm,Nudality!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kurumu=surprised,You actually have some modesty? Maybe I misjudged you...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zoey=embarrassed,Yeah. Great.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie_leonhart=beat,I bet. Only good thing that happens when I'm naked involves the hot springs.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mia=embarrassed,Hold on! Objection! That can't be in the rules, can it?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:may=beat,Excuse me while I go to a corner myself...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6=embarrassed,Y-Yeah, save it for another time, please!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:arwen=awkward,(I'll just keep any comments to myself here.)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=awkward,Well, I think she said she was an art student.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:revy=beat,(Nothing worse than a cornered fox. Hope this goes well.)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:penny=beat,Your resolve broke in, like, fifteen seconds. Way to be professional, Pit.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=shy,I bet humiliation is a different beast than what you're used to. I'm a seasoned fighter, but this is making me break into a cold sweat!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:morrigan=shy,I... guess you aren't totally hideous.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=shy,I thought that was just common sense.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zelda=embarrassed,Oh, you bet I'll be keeping this a secret from everyone.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shy,I wouldn't let a spider bite me, even if it was in that way...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=surprised,For a game like this? Did you not know better?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:samus=stunned,You've gone above and beyond them. Absolutely incredible!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shy,If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't judge you even if you were a freak. Okay, maybe if you were <i>really</i> out there.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:velma_classic=devoted,So I'm not the only one? Thank goodness!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella=beat,Can't get any worse... unless you, like, rip your skin off. But I'm sure you'd never do that.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=shy,Just try and focus, okay Nagisa? You haven't forfeit yet!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:hope,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,You always know what to say in these situations, don't you Marinette?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:weiss_v4=embarrassed,I never expected you to be shaved. It's oddly a good look for you...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=shy,And then you have the in-betweeners. Like me.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dark_magician_girl,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:5=annoyed,And it's a waste of magic.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:florina=smug,For someone who's so shy, you wouldn't think she shaves down there. Maybe she wanted to be seen...?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

female_must_masturbate=beat,I hate to tell you, but... you're up.
female_start_masturbating=shy,This is really happening...
female_start_masturbating=calm,Do you want me to give you privacy? I don't mind.

female_start_masturbating=shy,Don't be afraid to take it nice and slow. I don't mind.
female_masturbating=stunned,If you don't mind me asking... how does it feel?
female_masturbating=embarrassed,(Uh oh. Feeling a little hotter down below.)
female_masturbating=sad,(Should I steal a glance at ~name~? No, that's wrong...)
female_masturbating=shy,I've never seen something like this before tonight.
female_masturbating=surprised,This all went by so fast... my head's in a blur.
female_masturbating=shy,You won't say anything about tonight, right?
female_masturbating=shy,(I think it'd be too presumptuous of me to look closer, huh?)
female_masturbating=beat,Just keep... doing what you're doing, I guess.
female_masturbating=devoted,C'mon, ~name~! You can do it!
female_masturbating=beat,I don't know if I'm really lucky or really unlucky, but... let's just say this isn't all that bad.
female_masturbating=shy,If you don't mind me saying, it's... really pretty.

0-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=smug,The Huntress became the prey, it seems.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,So is this what humans call "pornography"?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=awkward,Sei's out. But to be honest, I think she stopped playing seriously like, four stages ago.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:velma=awkward,Ah, good job. But, uh, well...
0-female_must_masturbate,target:misty,totalAlive:5=surprised,She has to do <i>what</i>?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:lilith=beat,Yeah, I guess so. That's that.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_thought_better=beat,Someone had to lose first... sorry it had to be you.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:marinette=beat,Well, Marinette lost. (Can't say I'm entirely displeased with this turn of events...)
0-female_must_masturbate,target:mara_jade=calm,Ah well. Maybe you should've tried some other game. I'm sure your galaxy's got a million of them.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=awkward,I can almost taste the bitterness.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=stunned,I'm truly shocked at this turn of events. No one could have seen this coming.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:5=shy,You didn't know either, huh?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:hope=devoted,Don't lose hope, Hope! It's not the end of the world!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=embarrassed,D-Don't rub it in! I'm sensitive about that.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va=joking,I hope your APM count is accurate...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart=thinking,(So this is how an "adnormal" girl does it?)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:annie=shy,I'll only look if you want me too, okay?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f=thinking,It's hard to imagine, but I guess your whole army <i>is</i> really horny...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:lara=shy,It's best not to think about it.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,<i>She had another one?</i>
0-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised,Y-You're gonna do it while flying?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=joking,How good is your hand-eye coordination?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:willow=embarrassed,Yeah... wait, what?!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ciri=embarrassed,<i>Wow</i>, that was a shift in attitude.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyoko=awkward,Give it everything you got, I guess?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:chica=sad,You haven't even started, but I feel utterly drained...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kurumu=smug,So, you reveal your true form!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:chun-li=shy,I'll just let you get to it, I guess.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:yang=surprised,I can't help it! I need to see if you'll get off with a Yang!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=shy,I didn't say something too harsh, did I?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:zelda=shy,S-So you're new to this too? That's reassuring.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:korra=sad,Er, sorry. I'm just sorry.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:peach=thinking,(Not sure what she's implying... probably better off not knowing)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't. I'd get performance anxiety too.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=beat,Check-ups are gonna be a lot more awkward after tonight.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=stunned,Whoa, what? What are those?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,It's a bit surreal, I bet. I can't really give advice since I'm a guy, but try and pretend I'm not even here.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:lilith=thinking,Will there be any powers involved in this?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=embarrassed,R-Revy! That's too far! The forfeit said nothing about sex!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,I really am sorry about this, Mahiru.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:meia=shy,Y-You say that like you expect to masturbate standing up again...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kim,alsoPlaying:shego=thinking,How worse are we talking? There's not many more humiliating positions to be in.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Doing this in front of your friend... let's hope this never leaves this building.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:d.va=shy,Right. "Leaked".
0-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,Just give it up, Juri. She's clearly not interested.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,I'm... not much of a music guy, anyway.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,If you don't want to watch, Ann, just look somewhere else. That's what I do when I'm feeling... overwhelmed.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:daria,alsoPlaying:jane=devoted,Nice to see such good friends bonding.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=calm,(Man, this is satisfying.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=devoted,Couldn't have put it better myself, Mei.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Don't let her get in your head Kim!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Hey, don't worry about Shego. You beat her, after all.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:velma_classic=happy,Then I guess your glasses won't be necessary.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerf=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in her place...)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_enjoy_the_show=sad,O-okay.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:velma=thinking,How long has that been here?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:paya=beat,So, uh... why do they call you Paya?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=happy,Ah! That makes sense now.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:jubilee=happy,Time for a Jubilee jamboree!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:jasmine=beat,You'd be better than me at it, at least.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,So this is probably a common thing for you, huh?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:jane=beat,Sleep sounds nice. Mind if I take a little nap during this?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=shy,(And with how flexible she is? I'm probably going to see something I shouldn't...)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kim=shy,Just lie back and enjoy it. I'll... look away.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:human=sad,Oh, f-forgive me... I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=beat,No mercy for the new guy, huh?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerm=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in his place...)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=smug,Of course! I'm not easy to beat, you know!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,marker:palutenacall=happy,Oh, we're going to dinner now? Let me just grab my stuff.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=beat,Oh! Uh. Good... name?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_wet=beat,I'm not willing to go over and verify that... I'll just take your word on it.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_will_moan=surprised,Moans? Hoooo boy.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=awkward,I just stick with "who" myself.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ann=angry,Hey, I'm not the type who watches. Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I'm no ~player~!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=beat,Top of the list of things I didn't expect to see today...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:arwen=joking,Well, if you have that much faith, no point in me worrying, is there?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sayla=happy,I do think about it a lot, but never during something like this.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=surprised,N-no! No. No? ...Is that how you're supposed to?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:monika=devoted,Just like that! ...I think. I've never seen someone do this before tonight, so you really shouldn't ask me for advice.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:lux=happy,Heh. You going like that reminds me of the Lightning Chariot's Lux. Just need Phos, I guess.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=surprised,You're going right for it? Don't you have to warm up, or something?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=happy,Sure. Do it however you want. Fast, slow, I don't really care.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=beat,I think you're a little more intoxicated than you think.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:seven=stunned,You could've fooled me.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=shy,(Wait, is she really going to dance as she does it?)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mileena=victory,I enjoy the fact that you lost, if nothing else.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=devoted,Don't let it get you down, Mia! I still believe in you!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mercy=thinking,Did you say something?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:uhura=shy,(Sorry ~player~, but it's better you than me getting her attention.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=embarrassed,Nono... I'm just fine like this, thank you.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sheena_classic=victory,Guess you get to see what it's like.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:zizou=shy,So you have to do it too. This game really doesn't make exceptions for anyone.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:evie=shy,Here she goes.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I guess that makes sense. Cats love their toys, after all.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:alice=annoyed,Don't look at her... rabbit hole, ~player~. It's rude.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:angie=shy,Well, she lost, so can't really ask for much more.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:faye=beat,Okay, I'll stop. You do your thing.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=stunned,Wait, she's a real girl now?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Is there such thing as a wet nightmare?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elena=sad,I pity the poor girl. No one deserves to do this against their will.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised,It was a joke! You're not going to hurt us with that, are you?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=stunned,(Now, how creative can an adventure game native get?)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ami=determined,Don't worry! You can trust me to not stare!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=embarrassed,That's not really necessary, but okay, I guess.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,Sorry, that was rude. Don't turn me into tempura, please.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amy_rose=joking,I hope that checkpoint was before the game began.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:daria=beat,It never goes away, Daria. Life always finds a way to degrade you, but you get used to it.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=pumped,Alright! Plus Super! ...I swear it sounded better in my head.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=happy,Still! Good job, everyone! We got the moral victory.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:marceline=pumped,What time is it? Showtime!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mei,marker:puns=joking,Now, hope you don't get <i>cold feet</i>.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru=shy,Go ahead and take your time, Mahiru.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=happy,I bet you'll make this hot... y'know, because you have fire.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:riva=shy,I feel so graced.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:mara_jade=annoyed,Well, that's certainly not dangerous at all.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:marinette=determined,If you're having trouble, try to imagine it like the whole world's fate rests in this performance!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meg=happy,And there you go, like a pegasus out of its stable.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sonya=awkward,Not gonna lie, this is very therapeutic.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:leela=beat,Moving right along...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=shy,Maybe this was inevitable... either way, might as well enjoy it, right?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=awkward,And that's a good thing.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sheva=shy,Yes, please do.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=surprised,...This is already a little depressing...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=loss,(C'mon, Pit, don't be a pervert. Take your eyes off Nugi-chan.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn=shy,I'll try not to mention this to your friends back home.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer=pumped,Well, as ol' Sonic used to say, "Gotta go fast!"
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in their place...)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:samus=loss,Vigilance... vigilance...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:saki=sad,It is that time I guess...this is why I was against the game in the first place.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:pearl=shy,I don't think this is what people mean when they ask to see your "pearly whites".
0-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=embarrassed,Really? Dang, my usual Space Pirates are <i>way</i> more asexual than you!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=angry,For real this time! No looking!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:piper=awkward,Good thing this isn't your home.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=stunned,Oh, I'd love to hear this song!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:pyrrha=happy,Still, this might be just what you could use.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena=beat,I'll just... give you some privacy.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,Wait, you're going to <i>wrestle</i>?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Is she a humanoid too?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:tina=stunned,That was a quick turnaround!
0-female_start_masturbating,target:orendi=shy,(I'll watch. A little bit, just to satisfy my morbid curiosity.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=beat,I was gonna keep my distance regardless.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=beat,Yeah, doesn't really work as well when the audience can't see the action.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:tifa=beat,Not even gonna sit down or anything? Sure, whatever floats your boat.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=shy,Time to see an expert at work, I guess.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:neo=sad,What do you want me to say? I can't figure you out at all...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:beatrix=smug,Wow, you seem angry. A shame, really.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:chara=victory,Guess all that big talk doesn't mean much now, eh Chara?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:calisto=shy,Wish I could just laugh away the awkwardness of the situation like you. Or should I say <i>Yew</i>?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:daphne=awkward,'Danger Prone'? You could call any of us that, and it would probably fit.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:asuna=stunned,Oh, I just remembered what the game was called.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Can't stop you, huh? At least try not to fire it..
0-female_start_masturbating,target:black_canary=sad,(Man, I feel kinda guilty watching this Ollie's lover like this.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ayano=awkward,(Just shut up and look elsewhere, Pit.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:chell=beat,Yeah, silent protagonists are annoying.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:blake=embarrassed,Let's just let her do her thing.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy=awkward,Guess you're right, as long as no one here leaks it.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen=embarrassed,Hoo boy... I can see... everything...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:gogo=awkward,Did I do that? I mean, I know I'm incredibly handsome, but...
0-female_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl,priority:0=shy,Still enjoying this more than the usual "magic shows" I get sent to.
0-female_masturbating,target:aella,priority:0=sad,(This is getting more awkward by the minute. Please hurry, Paella.)
0-female_masturbating,target:korra,priority:0=beat,You look more relaxed now, at least.
0-female_masturbating,target:joey=thinking,Aren't you uncomfortable standing up like that? Pull up a chair or something, I don't mind.
0-female_masturbating,target:arwen,priority:0=embarrassed,(I thought I'd only see humans doing this tonight, but Arwen's close enough.)
0-female_masturbating,target:weiss_v4,priority:0=shy,(I think Weiss is enjoying herself... to think she was so snooty twenty minutes ago.)
0-female_masturbating,target:pearl,priority:0=thinking,Here comes a thought... if you're a gem with a humanoid form made of light, where do the fluids come from?
0-female_masturbating,target:pyrrha,priority:0=shy,(I should probably look away, right? I'm sure such a reserved girl wouldn't like me staring.)
0-female_masturbating,target:blake,priority:0=awkward,(Guess she gets to live out her fantasies at least.)
0-female_masturbating,target:dawn,priority:0=joking,Seeing Dawn masturbate like this...before tonight, I would've called it <i>Farfetch'd</i>.
0-female_masturbating,target:launch,priority:0=shy,I really have no idea how you can get off with that thing.
0-female_masturbating,target:misty,priority:0=awkward,Hey, keep it up and you'll make your own pool to swim in!
0-female_masturbating,target:tina,priority:0=awkward,What is it with you DOA girls and these sorts of activities?
0-female_masturbating,target:faye,priority:0=shy,Maybe now you know how I feel...
0-female_masturbating,target:sheena_classic,priority:0=embarrassed,You've, uh, really started enjoying it, haven't you?
0-female_masturbating,target:morrigan,priority:0=thinking,(What I want to know is why this Lilith succubus came here naked.)
0-female_masturbating,target:morrigan,priority:0=beat,I swear this goes beyond just masturbation...
0-female_masturbating,target:clover,targetTimeInStage:14-19=determined,I don't know why... but if you want to look at you, I will.
0-female_masturbating,target:aimee,priority:0=embarrassed,Dang... you really <i>are</i> good with those fingers, huh...
0-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=embarrassed,(So is this what sex is like? I don't know if I could handle that...)
0-female_masturbating,target:mahiru,priority:0=embarrassed,Are you still taking pictures during this? ...Gotta admire the dedication.
0-female_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,priority:0=thinking,I thought you were taking us to dinner. Is that still happening?
0-female_masturbating,target:asuna,priority:0=pumped,C'mon, I know you're up for the challenge!
0-female_masturbating,target:uravity=sad,(It's times like these where I wish I could fly most of all. Humans like Uravity get to act all cool with their flight, and here I am, on the boring old ground.)
0-female_masturbating,target:orendi,priority:0=thinking,(If nothing else, I'm learning a lot about biology.)
0-female_masturbating,target:piper,priority:0=smug,One Piper piping.
0-female_masturbating,target:aiyana,priority:0=awkward,I never knew the Down Under could be this... wet.
0-female_masturbating,target:leela,priority:0=shy,What happened to just plain ol' walking the plank, or something?
0-female_masturbating,target:nagisa,priority:0=awkward,That's one way to get me to see a play!
0-female_masturbating,target:tifa,priority:0=shy,Now I see where Tifa gets her reputation.
0-female_masturbating,target:saki=embarrassed,(Saki...yikes. She could use some help.)
0-female_masturbating,target:sei,priority:0=joking,You're kind of good at this, know what I'm Sei-ing?
0-female_masturbating,target:d.va,priority:0=beat,(Is it a bad time to ask for a co-op game sometime?)
0-female_masturbating,target:meg,priority:0=stunned,Just... keep on keeping on, Meg.
0-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=calm,(I think Natsuki's doing fine now. Good for her.)
0-female_masturbating,target:alice,priority:0=shy,You're making some very interesting noises there.
0-female_masturbating,target:chun-li=calm,So not as bad as you thought?
0-female_masturbating,target:lyn,priority:0=embarrassed,You're usually so poised and elegant on the battlefield. This is pretty insane to me!
0-female_masturbating,target:lyn,priority:0=thinking,I never noticed, but your voice seems... different from what I remember.
0-female_masturbating,target:clover,priority:0=thinking,(Why is she thinking of me? This isn't some sort of revenge scheme, is it?)
0-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=embarrassed,(If there was any doubt before, it's gone now: Juri totally wants Chun-Li.)
0-female_masturbating,target:amalia,priority:0=shy,(This is actually pretty satisfying with how much of a brat she was being earlier...)
0-female_masturbating,target:ciri,priority:0=sad,(I shouldn't look, but... Ciri's so into it, I'd be doing her a disservice by ignoring her...)
0-female_masturbating,target:lux,priority:0=embarrassed,(Lux and Phosphora... imagine them meeting!)
0-female_masturbating,target:elena,priority:0=shy,Maybe Elena'll feel better after all this?

1-female_must_masturbate,target:uhura=smug,Go ahead, Uhura. The stage is yours. And I hope I've been saying that right.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,So is this what humans call "pornography"?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:5=shy,You didn't know either, huh?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=happy,I beat a half-demon without killing them! That's a first.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:velma_classic=shy,Do this often?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=smug,Hey, Captain, I think she wants you to watch! Make sure you look <i>long and hard</i> at Corrin's performance!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:aiyana=stunned,So that's it? For real now?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:black_canary,totalAlive:5=awkward,<i>Mind</i> if I use that excuse?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:pyrrha=beat,Rules are rules, Pyrrha.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:velma=awkward,Ah, good job. But, uh, well...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:1-4=stunned,What's the story behind that?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:2-4=awkward,Glad you're being a good sport about it.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,She'll be a great teacher for you, I'm sure.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_thought_better=beat,Someone had to lose first... sorry it had to be you.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_should_be_fun=happy,I bet it is.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=pumped,Understand now? Lady Palutena is the superior goddess!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So... do both of you do the forfeit?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=surprised,Oh sweet Palutena they multiplied.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=thinking,Seriously... get a better gender ratio next time.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=beat,Why am I not surprised at this?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway? Sounds fancy.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:jane=happy,Maybe we should have her do a different punishment. Let's brainstorm something, eh?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=awkward,Oh, don't be a baby. Even I'll do the forfeit.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=victory,At least you beat her. That's gotta count for something, right Chun-Li?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:hermione=victory,Guess knowing how to play isn't everything after all!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_one_of_a_kind=smug,Maybe not one-of-a-kind, but this'll be the first of it's kind I'll get.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu,totalAlive:5=stunned,I don't know whether to be impressed or sorry for you.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,I get it. You two are close.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:harley,totalAlive:5=smug,Well, Harley's not winning this.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:jasmine=calm,So... it's come to this. Good luck Jasmine, you're out.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:saki=beat,Sheesh. Why do I feel so bad about this?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,I've been waiting for this, ~name~...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalMales:4,totalAlive:5=embarrassed,W-what is that? ...I'm just gonna pretend it's food and never ask again.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:videl=smug,This fight is over! And for once, it didn't take multiple episodes.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:monika=shy,I'm sure this is something you're not used to, Monika, but you'll do great! ~player~ is here to help, after all!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:hope=joking,Guess Lucina was wrong. Hope <i>can</i> die. Figuratively, of course.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:5=shy,I guess I wouldn't mind a tutorial...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alice=smug,So much for prim and proper.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:misty,totalAlive:5=surprised,She has to do <i>what</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mercy=thinking,Did you say something?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn=shy,I'll try not to mention this to your friends back home.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru=shy,Go ahead and take your time, Mahiru.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,I'm... not much of a music guy, anyway.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=shy,(Wait, is she really going to dance as she does it?)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Is there such thing as a wet nightmare?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=stunned,Wait, she's a real girl now?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:lara=shy,It's best not to think about it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:marinette=determined,If you're having trouble, try to imagine it like the whole world's fate rests in this performance!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mara_jade=annoyed,Well, that's certainly not dangerous at all.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:velma=thinking,How long has that been here?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sheena_classic=victory,Guess you get to see what it's like.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:ami=determined,Don't worry! You can trust me to not stare!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sonya=awkward,Not gonna lie, this is very therapeutic.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:chica=sad,You haven't even started, but I feel utterly drained...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:lilith=thinking,Will there be any powers involved in this?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:meg=happy,And there you go, like a pegasus out of its stable.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,If you don't want to watch, Ann, just look somewhere else. That's what I do when I'm feeling... overwhelmed.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:velma_classic=happy,Then I guess your glasses won't be necessary.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=beat,Top of the list of things I didn't expect to see today...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_enjoy_the_show=sad,O-okay.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:chun-li=shy,I'll just let you get to it, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised,Y-You're gonna do it while flying?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer=pumped,Well, as ol' Sonic used to say, "Gotta go fast!"
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised,It was a joke! You're not going to hurt us with that, are you?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_wet=beat,I'm not willing to go over and verify that... I'll just take your word on it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,<i>She had another one?</i>
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elena=sad,I pity the poor girl. No one deserves to do this against their will.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=embarrassed,R-Revy! That's too far! The forfeit said nothing about sex!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,I really am sorry about this, Mahiru.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:tina=stunned,That was a quick turnaround!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=embarrassed,D-Don't rub it in! I'm sensitive about that.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:marceline=pumped,What time is it? Showtime!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f=thinking,It's hard to imagine, but I guess your whole army <i>is</i> really horny...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't. I'd get performance anxiety too.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=stunned,Oh, I'd love to hear this song!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:uhura=shy,(Sorry ~player~, but it's better you than me getting her attention.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mileena=victory,I enjoy the fact that you lost, if nothing else.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:d.va=shy,Right. "Leaked".
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kim,alsoPlaying:shego=thinking,How worse are we talking? There's not many more humiliating positions to be in.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:hope=devoted,Don't lose hope, Hope! It's not the end of the world!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena=beat,So this is something, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:korra=sad,Er, sorry. I'm just sorry.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=shy,Time to see an expert at work, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:annie=shy,I'll only look if you want me too, okay?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Can't stop you, huh? At least try not to fire it..
1-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_will_moan=surprised,Moans? Hoooo boy.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=stunned,Whoa, what? What are those?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen=embarrassed,Hoo boy... I can see... everything...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:gogo=awkward,Did I do that? I mean, I know I'm incredibly handsome, but...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=joking,How good is your hand-eye coordination?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:lux=happy,Heh. You going like that reminds me of the Lightning Chariot's Lux. Just need Phos, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va=joking,I hope your APM count is accurate...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Doing this in front of your friend... let's hope this never leaves this building.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:peach=thinking,(Not sure what she's implying... probably better off not knowing)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mei,marker:puns=joking,Now, hope you don't get <i>cold feet</i>.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=beat,Yeah, doesn't really work as well when the audience can't see the action.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:daphne=awkward,'Danger Prone'? You could call any of us that, and it would probably fit.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=beat,Check-ups are gonna be a lot more awkward after tonight.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:faye=beat,Okay, I'll stop. You do your thing.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=surprised,You're going right for it? Don't you have to warm up, or something?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:leela=beat,Moving right along...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,Just give it up, Juri. She's clearly not interested.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:willow=embarrassed,Yeah... wait, what?!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:angie=shy,Well, she lost, so can't really ask for much more.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Is she a humanoid too?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=devoted,Don't let it get you down, Mia! I still believe in you!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart=thinking,(So this is how an "adnormal" girl does it?)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyoko=awkward,Give it everything you got, I guess?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:tifa=beat,Not even gonna sit down or anything? Sure, whatever floats your boat.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice=annoyed,Don't look at her... rabbit hole, ~player~. It's rude.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kurumu=smug,So, you reveal your true form!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:meia=shy,Y-You say that like you expect to masturbate standing up again...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:yang=surprised,I can't help it! I need to see if you'll get off with a Yang!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I guess that makes sense. Cats love their toys, after all.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=embarrassed,Really? Dang, my usual Space Pirates are <i>way</i> more asexual than you!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=shy,I didn't say something too harsh, did I?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:zelda=shy,S-So you're new to this too? That's reassuring.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:ciri=embarrassed,<i>Wow</i>, that was a shift in attitude.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=embarrassed,That's not really necessary, but okay, I guess.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=stunned,(Now, how creative can an adventure game native get?)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=happy,I bet you'll make this hot... y'know, because you have fire.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=shy,(And with how flexible she is? I'm probably going to see something I shouldn't...)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:blake=embarrassed,Let's just let her do her thing.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=beat,Oh! Uh. Good... name?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:evie=shy,Here she goes.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,Wait, you're going to <i>wrestle</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=beat,I think you're a little more intoxicated than you think.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerm=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in his place...)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:chell=beat,Yeah, silent protagonists are annoying.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:jane=beat,Sleep sounds nice. Mind if I take a little nap during this?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayla=happy,I do think about it a lot, but never during something like this.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:pyrrha=happy,Still, this might be just what you could use.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=happy,Sure. Do it however you want. Fast, slow, I don't really care.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:ayano=awkward,(Just shut up and look elsewhere, Pit.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=happy,Still! Good job, everyone! We got the moral victory.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerf=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in her place...)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:asuna=stunned,Oh, I just remembered what the game was called.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:chara=victory,Guess all that big talk doesn't mean much now, eh Chara?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,It's a bit surreal, I bet. I can't really give advice since I'm a guy, but try and pretend I'm not even here.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in their place...)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=beat,I was gonna keep my distance regardless.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:beatrix=smug,Wow, you seem angry. A shame, really.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:saki=sad,It is that time I guess...this is why I was against the game in the first place.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=loss,(C'mon, Pit, don't be a pervert. Take your eyes off Nugi-chan.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:human=sad,Oh, f-forgive me... I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=devoted,Couldn't have put it better myself, Mei.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=pumped,Alright! Plus Super! ...I swear it sounded better in my head.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Don't let her get in your head Kim!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:orendi=shy,(I'll watch. A little bit, just to satisfy my morbid curiosity.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=beat,No mercy for the new guy, huh?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:seven=stunned,You could've fooled me.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kim=shy,Just lie back and enjoy it. I'll... look away.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:riva=shy,I feel so graced.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=embarrassed,Nono... I'm just fine like this, thank you.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:samus=loss,Vigilance... vigilance...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=smug,Of course! I'm not easy to beat, you know!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:daria=beat,It never goes away, Daria. Life always finds a way to degrade you, but you get used to it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:zizou=shy,So you have to do it too. This game really doesn't make exceptions for anyone.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=angry,For real this time! No looking!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,Sorry, that was rude. Don't turn me into tempura, please.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=surprised,...This is already a little depressing...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:jubilee=happy,Time for a Jubilee jamboree!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=awkward,I just stick with "who" myself.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:calisto=shy,Wish I could just laugh away the awkwardness of the situation like you. Or should I say <i>Yew</i>?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:ann=angry,Hey, I'm not the type who watches. Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I'm no ~player~!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:black_canary=sad,(Man, I feel kinda guilty watching this Ollie's lover like this.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:pearl=shy,I don't think this is what people mean when they ask to see your "pearly whites".
1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=surprised,N-no! No. No? ...Is that how you're supposed to?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:amy_rose=joking,I hope that checkpoint was before the game began.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Hey, don't worry about Shego. You beat her, after all.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:neo=sad,What do you want me to say? I can't figure you out at all...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=awkward,And that's a good thing.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy=awkward,Guess you're right, as long as no one here leaks it.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:paya=beat,So, uh... why do they call you Paya?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:arwen=joking,Well, if you have that much faith, no point in me worrying, is there?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:daria,alsoPlaying:jane=devoted,Nice to see such good friends bonding.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:monika=devoted,Just like that! ...I think. I've never seen someone do this before tonight, so you really shouldn't ask me for advice.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sheva=shy,Yes, please do.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:jasmine=beat,You'd be better than me at it, at least.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,So this is probably a common thing for you, huh?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=calm,(Man, this is satisfying.)
1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=happy,Ah! That makes sense now.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,marker:palutenacall=happy,Oh, we're going to dinner now? Let me just grab my stuff.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:piper=awkward,Good thing this isn't your home.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=shy,Maybe this was inevitable... either way, might as well enjoy it, right?
1-female_masturbating,target:sayla,priority:0=awkward,So, what's a good Great Sacred Treasure fact? Sayla sounds like she'd like to hear <i>all about</i> it...
1-female_masturbating,target:blackrose,priority:0=embarrassed,(I can hardly focus with BlackRose moaning like that...)
1-female_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart,priority:0=shy,(Wow... she's...really digging deep.)
1-female_masturbating,target:chun-li=calm,So not as bad as you thought?
1-female_masturbating,target:pyrrha,priority:0=shy,(I should probably look away, right? I'm sure such a reserved girl wouldn't like me staring.)
1-female_masturbating,target:ami,priority:0=stunned,It's not like I'm <i>trying</i> to watch, you know.
1-female_masturbating,target:misato,priority:0=beat,So undignified... does alcohol have <i>this</i> much of an effect?
1-female_masturbating,target:d.va,priority:0=beat,(Is it a bad time to ask for a co-op game sometime?)
1-female_masturbating,target:peach,priority:0=awkward,Sooo good news: I don't think you'll be interrupted any time soon.
1-female_masturbating,target:peach,priority:0=shy,(I hope this doesn't make our next smash too akward. Peach would be a great friend.)
1-female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=awkward,Awww. She looks so peaceful.
1-female_masturbating,target:ayano,priority:0=beat,Wow, you've got issues.
1-female_masturbating,target:aiyana,priority:0=awkward,I never knew the Down Under could be this... wet.
1-female_masturbating,target:corrin_f,priority:0=embarrassed,(I guess she's getting what she deserves for how she treats Lady Palutena, but I can't help but feel this isn't a punishment for her.)
1-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=embarrassed,(If there was any doubt before, it's gone now: Juri totally wants Chun-Li.)
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,priority:0=shy,(I think Weiss is enjoying herself... to think she was so snooty twenty minutes ago.)
1-female_masturbating,target:kimberly,priority:0=awkward,(Who knew she was a... what do they call it? Valley girl?)
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan,priority:0=thinking,(So when's she actually going to use that thing? She's just holding it there...)

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=smug,Taking it easy on her, I see. Maybe you do have a soft spot for her.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:daphne=smug,'Jeepers'? Really? That's way more embarrassing than anything we've seen from you!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=shy,If I say I enjoyed it, will you please never do that again?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Aw, I was almost hoping I could beat her too.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=devoted,What a <i>Vigor</i>-ous show!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=happy,I wonder whose hands those are... and if they know what they're touching...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:marceline,alsoPlaying:xander=beat,Guess we're all Vampire Slayers now. Except Xander. He's, like, a Super Slayer, or something.

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:gwen=pumped,You really left us <i>hanging by a thread</i> there.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=joking,I guess as long as you're happy... and ~player~, too, by the look of it.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=awkward,You okay? With your b-butt, I mean.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:pyrrha=joking,I guess you could call this a <i>pyrrhic victory</i> for you.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:lux=pumped,I prefer the term 'Final Smash', but that <i>was</i> pretty good.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=pumped,All done!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:mara_jade=awkward,At least this is non-canon.

1-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=stunned,That was incredible! You've got the makings of a hero, alright! Maybe sometime... we could... never mind.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=awkward,Heh, figures a porn game mascot would have a little masochistic side...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=pumped,Valkyrie offline!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=surprised,Was that the jumpscare? I, uh, wasn't scared. At all!

2-male_must_masturbate,target:xander=smug,Go ahead, Xander. I want to be impressed by your "machismo".
2-male_must_masturbate,target:ryu=awkward,Not so much an A-tier here, are you?
2-male_must_masturbate,target:shaggy=beat,Just gonna... keep on not watching you...
2-male_must_masturbate,target:mettaton=beat,What else is there? You've already made a strong impression on us.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Do you even know how to do this? You don't exactly look like the type who does...
2-male_must_masturbate,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=calm,I can tell. <i>Mr. Game and Watch</i> moves more than you.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:caleb=thinking,So catboys do it the same way as humans, right?
2-male_must_masturbate,target:kira=smug,Don't underestimate us.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:jin=smug,You talked a good game, but it wasn't enough, old man.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,You okay there? I can't really tell, since you have a great poker face.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america=sad,At least I sort of knew what I was getting into. What a rude awakening for the Cap...
2-male_must_masturbate,target:link=devoted,Thank Lady Palutena, Link didn't win for once!
2-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=awkward,Whaddya know? I beat Captain Falcon!
2-male_must_masturbate,target:fred=beat,I just wanted to win. I never wanted <i>this</i>.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:human=smug,Oh, don't worry. I won't stare. There are far more attractive things to look at here. Like the cards.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:fred=sad,I think we lost him.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:xander=awkward,Sorry if this is rude, but I don't believe you. Like, at all.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:ryu=beat,I don't really have a right to judge you.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:corrin_m=surprised,Wow, this might be an even worse case than me...

2-male_start_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=loss,Please. Just... don't.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:link=calm,And now you have to get yourself out.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_america=awkward,But you actually have some idea of what you're doing, so it sort of balances out.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=shy,Didn't realize you two were that close.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=sad,I respect you too much to watch. I'll just... focus elsewhere.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:jin=thinking,<i>Now</i> you're clamming up? Weird...
2-male_masturbating,target:captain_falcon,priority:0=loss,(Must not watch... must... not... watch...)
2-male_masturbating,target:9s=shy,So 9s, does it, you know... function?
2-male_masturbating,target:corrin_m,priority:0=awkward,Corrin's just... doing his own thing over there.
2-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,(Is it bad I'd rather be doing anything else than watch this chef?)
2-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=angry,Uggggh... this is taking forever.
2-male_masturbating,target:jin,priority:0=awkward,You're still somehow more collected than I am. You're pretty cool.
2-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=shy,What an interesting way of doing it.

2-male_masturbating,target:mettaton,priority:0=happy,Real drama! Real action! Real fanservice?
2-male_masturbating,target:link,priority:0=thinking,I can't tell if your prowess with the sword is helping here or not...

2-male_masturbating,target:shaggy,priority:0=loss,(Stop making me hungry, dang it!)
2-male_masturbating,target:fred,priority:0=sad,(I kinda pity him. After all, I care too much about things like this too.)
2-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=shy,(Seriously, never expected Ryu to have <i>that</i> in his pants.)
2-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=annoyed,(Good thing it's not just the two of us. I can ignore the vampire slayer and not feel as guilty.)
2-male_masturbating,target:kira,priority:0=stunned,(This guy's telling us his life story now? Hard to think he was so secretive earlier.)
2-male_masturbating,target:kira,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:0=angry,Stop staring at her while... doing that! It's creepy!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=pumped,And now to never speak of this again.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=surprised,You ever get that feeling when you wake up and the room's just a little too bright? That's what that felt like right now.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryu=calm,That's one Hadouken I'm glad I didn't get hit by.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=happy,You're still unmatched in speed, Captain! I'm impressed!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=calm,I never had a crush myself. But this seems kind of sweet.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:fred=awkward,Guess that's it then. But hey, you did your best, Freddy.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=happy,Good show, ~player~, good show.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:shaggy=pumped,Okay! <i>Now</i> roll credits!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shy,Let's just forget tonight ever happened, Corrin.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=pumped,No glitches here!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:link=joking,I'm sure there was a good reason he lost, but I can't find the <i>link</i>.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_america=pumped,Patriotic <i>and</i> erotic! Patri-erotic!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander=beat,Miss your friend? ...I do too, sometimes. Maybe I should pay them a visit.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:kira=shy,Is it over?
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:mettaton=pumped,Robot defused!
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:caleb=stunned,...So that just happened.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:buffy=joking,Guess the slayer was slayed tonight.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:dark_magician_girl=smug,Not surprising. You don't even have a real name!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:tina=shy,Welp. This is hapening now.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aiyana=stunned,So that's it? For real now?

2-female_must_masturbate,target:chun-li=awkward,Sorry, Chun-Li. You need more practice, I guess.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:lux=awkward,Maybe you shouldn't have told everyone your plan like a cartoon villain.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:asuna=awkward,Did Asuna lose? Wasn't expecting that.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=smug,Hey, Captain, I think she wants you to watch! Make sure you look <i>long and hard</i> at Corrin's performance!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=beat,Why am I not surprised at this?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=shy,Do you really want me to watch you, Ms. Fit? You aren't weirded out that your friend will be watching you?

2-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=victory,At least you beat her. That's gotta count for something, right Chun-Li?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sheva=smug,Betcha prefer the zombies, huh? Well, uh, too bad.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:hope=joking,Guess Lucina was wrong. Hope <i>can</i> die. Figuratively, of course.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:daphne=pumped,Daphne may have lost, but for some reason, that doesn't surprise me.

2-female_must_masturbate,target:scarlet_witch=annoyed,I can already tell that this will go great.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:elena=surprised,Did no one tell her? That's a bit too much, isn't it?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_win_win=shy,That's almost flattering...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_one_of_a_kind=smug,Maybe not one-of-a-kind, but this'll be the first of it's kind I'll get.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,I get it. You two are close.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:may=smug,And now the Coordinator takes center stage.

2-female_must_masturbate,target:mara_jade=calm,Ah well. Maybe you should've tried some other game. I'm sure your galaxy's got a million of them.

2-female_must_masturbate,target:sharla=surprised,You're not mad?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:hermione=victory,Guess knowing how to play isn't everything after all!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:lara=awkward,She fell into a pretty big trap.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kim=calm,And there's the rub. Literally.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=awkward,Hope you know about the forfeit. Mostly 'cause even I still don't get it completely.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:harley,totalAlive:5=smug,Well, Harley's not winning this.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=beat,Well, here we go...  what a night this turned out to be.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=awkward,Is this really that surprising when you're about as tall as the cards?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:1-4=stunned,What's the story behind that?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=smug,You lost because you were going against the one and only Pit!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=awkward,(Good news is I don't think she wants my head anymore.)
2-female_must_masturbate,target:corrin_f=devoted,She's finally out, thank goodness. I was getting worried.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:jubilee=awkward,Looks like you were mostly just talk.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:april=pumped,Delivery imminent!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:willow=pumped,The fair Willow, down for the count!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu,totalAlive:5=stunned,I don't know whether to be impressed or sorry for you.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:pearl=beat,This shouldn't be so bad... it's not like this Pearl will shoot me with electric balls...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=beat,*sigh* Never mind.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=thinking,Play?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=thinking,Seriously... get a better gender ratio next time.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:beatrix=pumped,Sometimes skill can't always beat luck, Beatrix.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:uhura=smug,Go ahead, Uhura. The stage is yours. And I hope I've been saying that right.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=pumped,No hacks required to beat Futaba!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=angry,You failed me, chat!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=thinking,A love fairy's gotta be real experienced doing this sort of gig, right? This should be a treat.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=happy,Hey, we did it! We beat a ghost!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=beat,It really wouldn't surprise me if she was wanted for public indecency...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,I've been waiting for this, ~name~...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:angie=thinking,Not going to pull another deus ex machina on us?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:5=shy,You didn't know either, huh?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:tracer=awkward,Looks like you're out of time. Get it?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=smug,Never? A woman of your talents? Please.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sonya=happy,You got what's coming to you.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=shy,That's the tragic nature of this game. But you knew what you were getting into, at least.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=beat,You don't have men where you're from, right?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:black_canary,totalAlive:5=awkward,<i>Mind</i> if I use that excuse?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena=surprised,I am <i>so</i> sorry.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=awkward,I can almost taste the bitterness.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=awkward,I'll do my best to give privacy.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:jasmine=calm,So... it's come to this. Good luck Jasmine, you're out.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misty,totalAlive:5=surprised,She has to do <i>what</i>?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alice=smug,So much for prim and proper.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=stunned,I'm truly shocked at this turn of events. No one could have seen this coming.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:uravity=shy,Sorry, Uravity. But at least you can show off how cool your power is!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:chara=awkward,Phew... Chara finally lost...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=pumped,Ding-dong! The dingo's out!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:launch=smug,Maybe you should've paid more attention instead of just making fun of us!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:zelda=joking,Don't worry, Zelda. I'm sure you'll make it a magical performance.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=thinking,Do you have the same... bodily fluids as living humans?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalMales:4,totalAlive:5=embarrassed,W-what is that? ...I'm just gonna pretend it's food and never ask again.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:penny=shy,You poor soul... this really is a ruthless game.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=beat,The Ultimate Detective, reduced to this. What a night.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:saki=beat,Sheesh. Why do I feel so bad about this?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=awkward,Oh, don't be a baby. Even I'll do the forfeit.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:5=shy,I guess I wouldn't mind a tutorial...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mercy=stunned,When did you do that? Am I out of the loop?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=awkward,Sorry, Mia. The miracle never happen. I mean, happened.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:paya=determined,Can do.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=happy,I beat a half-demon without killing them! That's a first.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:ann=thinking,And Ann's out. Are we really going to make her masturbate?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=surprised,I'm sorry, Natsuki. If I could help you, I would...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:jane=happy,Maybe we should have her do a different punishment. Let's brainstorm something, eh?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway? Sounds fancy.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=smug,No snarky quips left, Shego?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=sad,I'm begging you, <i>please</i> don't use your weapon for this.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rosalina=pumped,So a top seed has been eliminated. Nice! Er, no offense.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:chell=happy,If you talked, I wouldn't mind letting you skip the forfeit. Anyone else?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sheena_classic=pumped,A woman of your word. I like that.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=awkward,Sei's out. But to be honest, I think she stopped playing seriously like, four stages ago.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:harley=beat,Really, we're all losers here. Or... all winners. Or something.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:riva=angry,Don't be such a baby! We <i>all</i> have to follow the rules, so just do it!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:tifa=shy,Sounds crazy, I know. But them's the rules.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shantae=awkward,Time for a different type of show, Shantae.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=embarrassed,Nono... I'm just fine like this, thank you.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:pearl=shy,I don't think this is what people mean when they ask to see your "pearly whites".
2-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=joking,How good is your hand-eye coordination?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:orendi=shy,(I'll watch. A little bit, just to satisfy my morbid curiosity.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:beatrix=smug,Wow, you seem angry. A shame, really.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:samus=loss,Vigilance... vigilance...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,marker:palutenacall=happy,Oh, we're going to dinner now? Let me just grab my stuff.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=angry,For real this time! No looking!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't. I'd get performance anxiety too.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=smug,Of course! I'm not easy to beat, you know!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=surprised,N-no! No. No? ...Is that how you're supposed to?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in their place...)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Hey, don't worry about Shego. You beat her, after all.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Doing this in front of your friend... let's hope this never leaves this building.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_will_moan=surprised,Moans? Hoooo boy.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=happy,I bet you'll make this hot... y'know, because you have fire.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:pyrrha=happy,Still, this might be just what you could use.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:ayano=awkward,(Just shut up and look elsewhere, Pit.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:asuna=stunned,Oh, I just remembered what the game was called.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerf=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in her place...)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kim=shy,Just lie back and enjoy it. I'll... look away.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:calisto=shy,Wish I could just laugh away the awkwardness of the situation like you. Or should I say <i>Yew</i>?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,Wait, you're going to <i>wrestle</i>?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=beat,I was gonna keep my distance regardless.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,It's a bit surreal, I bet. I can't really give advice since I'm a guy, but try and pretend I'm not even here.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=beat,Oh! Uh. Good... name?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena=awkward,If it makes you feel better, I'm sure you'll bring the house down.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayla=happy,I do think about it a lot, but never during something like this.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:hope=devoted,Don't lose hope, Hope! It's not the end of the world!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:piper=awkward,Good thing this isn't your home.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:saki=sad,It is that time I guess...this is why I was against the game in the first place.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=pumped,Alright! Plus Super! ...I swear it sounded better in my head.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:annie=shy,I'll only look if you want me too, okay?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:chara=victory,Guess all that big talk doesn't mean much now, eh Chara?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:d.va=shy,Right. "Leaked".
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kim,alsoPlaying:shego=thinking,How worse are we talking? There's not many more humiliating positions to be in.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=surprised,You're going right for it? Don't you have to warm up, or something?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va=joking,I hope your APM count is accurate...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerm=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in his place...)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:peach=thinking,(Not sure what she's implying... probably better off not knowing)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=awkward,I just stick with "who" myself.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Don't let her get in your head Kim!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=shy,Time to see an expert at work, I guess.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:human=sad,Oh, f-forgive me... I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:gogo=awkward,Did I do that? I mean, I know I'm incredibly handsome, but...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=stunned,Whoa, what? What are those?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy=awkward,Guess you're right, as long as no one here leaks it.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:zizou=shy,So you have to do it too. This game really doesn't make exceptions for anyone.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=loss,(C'mon, Pit, don't be a pervert. Take your eyes off Nugi-chan.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:uhura=shy,(Sorry ~player~, but it's better you than me getting her attention.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Can't stop you, huh? At least try not to fire it..
2-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=devoted,Couldn't have put it better myself, Mei.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=beat,No mercy for the new guy, huh?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen=embarrassed,Hoo boy... I can see... everything...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=happy,Sure. Do it however you want. Fast, slow, I don't really care.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:chun-li=shy,I'll just let you get to it, I guess.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:riva=shy,I feel so graced.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=shy,(Wait, is she really going to dance as she does it?)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=beat,Check-ups are gonna be a lot more awkward after tonight.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=stunned,(Now, how creative can an adventure game native get?)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:lilith=thinking,Will there be any powers involved in this?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:seven=stunned,You could've fooled me.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=devoted,Don't let it get you down, Mia! I still believe in you!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sonya=awkward,Not gonna lie, this is very therapeutic.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:daphne=awkward,'Danger Prone'? You could call any of us that, and it would probably fit.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:tina=stunned,That was a quick turnaround!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:chica=sad,You haven't even started, but I feel utterly drained...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:ami=determined,Don't worry! You can trust me to not stare!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:velma=thinking,How long has that been here?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:leela=beat,Moving right along...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:angie=shy,Well, she lost, so can't really ask for much more.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sheena_classic=victory,Guess you get to see what it's like.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:willow=embarrassed,Yeah... wait, what?!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,Just give it up, Juri. She's clearly not interested.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart=thinking,(So this is how an "adnormal" girl does it?)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Is she a humanoid too?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:paya=beat,So, uh... why do they call you Paya?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:monika=devoted,Just like that! ...I think. I've never seen someone do this before tonight, so you really shouldn't ask me for advice.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:meia=shy,Y-You say that like you expect to masturbate standing up again...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mileena=victory,I enjoy the fact that you lost, if nothing else.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sheva=shy,Yes, please do.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=embarrassed,That's not really necessary, but okay, I guess.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:meg=happy,And there you go, like a pegasus out of its stable.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=embarrassed,R-Revy! That's too far! The forfeit said nothing about sex!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_wet=beat,I'm not willing to go over and verify that... I'll just take your word on it.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,If you don't want to watch, Ann, just look somewhere else. That's what I do when I'm feeling... overwhelmed.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru=shy,Go ahead and take your time, Mahiru.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:lara=shy,It's best not to think about it.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Is there such thing as a wet nightmare?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mara_jade=annoyed,Well, that's certainly not dangerous at all.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,I really am sorry about this, Mahiru.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_enjoy_the_show=sad,O-okay.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elena=sad,I pity the poor girl. No one deserves to do this against their will.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,<i>She had another one?</i>
2-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn=shy,I'll try not to mention this to your friends back home.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,I'm... not much of a music guy, anyway.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyoko=awkward,Give it everything you got, I guess?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mercy=thinking,Did you say something?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised,It was a joke! You're not going to hurt us with that, are you?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:marinette=determined,If you're having trouble, try to imagine it like the whole world's fate rests in this performance!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised,Y-You're gonna do it while flying?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=stunned,Wait, she's a real girl now?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:ciri=embarrassed,<i>Wow</i>, that was a shift in attitude.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer=pumped,Well, as ol' Sonic used to say, "Gotta go fast!"
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=embarrassed,D-Don't rub it in! I'm sensitive about that.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:faye=beat,Okay, I'll stop. You do your thing.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=beat,Top of the list of things I didn't expect to see today...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:velma_classic=happy,Then I guess your glasses won't be necessary.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=beat,Yeah, doesn't really work as well when the audience can't see the action.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice=annoyed,Don't look at her... rabbit hole, ~player~. It's rude.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:daria,alsoPlaying:jane=devoted,Nice to see such good friends bonding.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:black_canary=sad,(Man, I feel kinda guilty watching this Ollie's lover like this.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amy_rose=joking,I hope that checkpoint was before the game began.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=embarrassed,Really? Dang, my usual Space Pirates are <i>way</i> more asexual than you!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=shy,Maybe this was inevitable... either way, might as well enjoy it, right?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:blake=embarrassed,Let's just let her do her thing.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:chell=beat,Yeah, silent protagonists are annoying.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=happy,Ah! That makes sense now.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,So this is probably a common thing for you, huh?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:zelda=shy,S-So you're new to this too? That's reassuring.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:mei,marker:puns=joking,Now, hope you don't get <i>cold feet</i>.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=happy,Still! Good job, everyone! We got the moral victory.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=beat,I think you're a little more intoxicated than you think.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:daria=beat,It never goes away, Daria. Life always finds a way to degrade you, but you get used to it.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:lux=happy,Heh. You going like that reminds me of the Lightning Chariot's Lux. Just need Phos, I guess.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=shy,(And with how flexible she is? I'm probably going to see something I shouldn't...)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:arwen=joking,Well, if you have that much faith, no point in me worrying, is there?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:ann=angry,Hey, I'm not the type who watches. Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I'm no ~player~!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:neo=sad,What do you want me to say? I can't figure you out at all...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:tifa=beat,Not even gonna sit down or anything? Sure, whatever floats your boat.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kurumu=smug,So, you reveal your true form!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,Sorry, that was rude. Don't turn me into tempura, please.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:evie=shy,Here she goes.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f=thinking,It's hard to imagine, but I guess your whole army <i>is</i> really horny...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=calm,(Man, this is satisfying.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=surprised,...This is already a little depressing...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:jubilee=happy,Time for a Jubilee jamboree!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=shy,I didn't say something too harsh, did I?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:marceline=pumped,What time is it? Showtime!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:yang=surprised,I can't help it! I need to see if you'll get off with a Yang!

2-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=stunned,That was incredible! You've got the makings of a hero, alright! Maybe sometime... we could... never mind.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:may=pumped,May whited out!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:ann=happy,It must've been really good if you're that winded!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sonya=pumped,You're the one who's finished today!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chiaki=pumped,And that's GG!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:tracer=pumped,Quick and dirty.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:neo=pumped,I always knew floor ice cream was healthy!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:orendi=pumped,All done!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meg=surprised,I had no idea women could squirt that much! It's actually really impressive.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=victory,Sharla, your skill is truly unrivalled. At least in this department.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shazza=pumped,Did you see that thunder?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking,Valkyrie offline! Wait, am I repeating myself?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:gogo=beat,Geez... I'd probably be less red-faced if you <i>won</i> the game.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:tina=beat,You know what? I'm just gonna leave it at that.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,I hope you two aren't planning on going like that...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Valkyrie down! Wait, haven't I used this one already?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:daria=awkward,Sorry to disappoint you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=awkward,Does Recall work that way?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=smug,Taking it easy on her, I see. Maybe you do have a soft spot for her.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=embarrassed,N-No, of course not! I just... didn't think you felt that way about me...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:marceline,alsoPlaying:xander=beat,Guess we're all Vampire Slayers now. Except Xander. He's, like, a Super Slayer, or something.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:marceline,alsoPlaying:buffy=beat,Guess we're all Vampire Slayers now. Except Buffy. She's, like, a Super Slayer now.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:samus=embarrassed,.........
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:samus=shy,This was one battle I'm glad I won.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette,alsoPlaying:palutena=sad,(Not everyone. But... maybe after tonight...)
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=happy,Hey, you should be proud! You completely outlasted her, even when she forced herself on you! Very respectable.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=shy,If I say I enjoyed it, will you please never do that again?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=happy,Great job, ~name~! Who knew all she needed to calm down a little was... that.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:mpuns=devoted,Yes! Finally someone who understands the value of wordplay!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=awkward,This race is over. Sorry, Ms. Song.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl,targetSaidMarker:fuck=annoyed,At least you apologized...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:ami=beat,Don't sweat it... any one of us could end up looking like that.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:beatrix,targetSaidMarker:bigone=happy,Ooh, I love fro-yo!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:blackrose=happy,You definitely look like you enjoyed yourself. This is the happiest I've seen you all game!

2-female_finished_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=determined,Okay! Stream over! You can all go watch something else now!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=pumped,Court is adjourned!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=awkward,It's always such a pleasure.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:navi=annoyed,Language...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:alice=awkward,Uh... glad you had fun?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=joking,Yeah, you should probably clean all that, uh... stardew.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:ruby=victory,The petals scatter.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:daphne=smug,'Jeepers'? Really? That's way more embarrassing than anything we've seen from you!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:arwen=awkward,IThe whole premise is humiliating, yeah, but you certainly look like you enjoyed it.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:piper=annoyed,I better not see this in the paper tomorrow.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:seven=pumped,That was pretty good. I give it a Seven of Nine!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aiyana=sad,What was that shriek? I'm fine... but still, keep it down please...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Whose name did you  just say?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:paya=annoyed,Yeah. Exciting.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=beat,I think the paella's a little sour right now... let's let her simmer for a bit.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:morrigan=awkward,Aw, I was almost hoping I could beat her too.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:yang=pumped,Flaming hot!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:pyrrha=joking,I guess you could call this a <i>pyrrhic victory</i> for you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rosalina=happy,Do I get a Power Star for this?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:pauling=awkward,Contract complete?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pumped,Talk about a tag team match!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,I, uh, do not.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:riva=pumped,Learn some humility yet?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=embarrassed,Naked, wet, and with your legs over your head. Ayep, definitely a disgraceful look for a princess... sorry.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=pumped,And good night!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=devoted,May Lady Palutena bless you.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=beat,A lewd performance for a lewd woman.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=pumped,Flame extinguished!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=shy,I'll... put in a good word.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=awkward,No promises, but I'll see what I can do.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=beat,He's a busy man, but I'll do my best.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=victory,At least we all got to see a full Moon.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:harley=victory,Heh. That's certainly an interesting take on the old "squirting flower" gag!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=pumped,In your gemface!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko=pumped,Finishing strike!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mei=pumped,A-mei-zing!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:lyn=awkward,I think you handled it. Well, at that.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheva=thinking,Uh, really? Can I ask <i>why</i> you cried that out?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:annie=surprised,You're shivering. Do you... need help with anything?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:calisto=awkward,Hehe. It's a little contagious, gotta admit.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:buffy=devoted,As far as I'm concerned, you <i>are</i> a normal girl. Hope we can be friends after this!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=devoted,That was as intense as the Galactic Sea itself!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart=surprised,(She got really into it by the end! It's... kind of attractive...)
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shego=pumped,There <i>she goes</i>!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:zizou=happy,I can get you a water if you'd like.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy=pumped,Valkyrie offline!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:natsuki=awkward,Wow, ~player~! Natsuki was thinking of you! Lucky!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:blake=shy,Would it be insulting if I asked to pet your head?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=awkward,I think your cheerleader came out a little there.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chara=smug,Well, <i>someone</i> had a good time. Now stay over there and let us wrap this up in peace.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shantae=pumped,All clear!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=pumped,Valkyrie down!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=joking,Let's give her a hand! ...Applause, I mean.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:zelda=surprised,Yikes! That got my heart pumping more than your Final Smash.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:saki=beat,So I've noticed.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:april=shy,I hope there isn't actually a studio involved.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:peach=awkward,I would've preferred a cake as my reward, but whatever.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:daisy=pumped,Consider those petals plucked!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:ciri=beat,I'll just chalk it up as a draw.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:alpha=happy,Okay, that was actually pretty cool. Great voice, too!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:korra=stunned,That must have been a really powerful orgasm. You're eyes rolled back all the way!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=joking,I guess as long as you're happy... and ~player~, too, by the look of it.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:asuna=devoted,I bet this Kirito person is proud of you, at least!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba=awkward,I felt like I learnt a lot today.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kurumu=pumped,Well, it was a nice try, servant of the Underworld. Light wins again!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uhura=beat,Whew! Finally over....
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan=happy,Oh, so that's what a fap is. Fitting.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:felicia=pumped,And with that, Felicia's me-out!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:lilith=awkward,Hey, I think you got a skill point!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:dawn=shy,You've got more stamina in you than that one Charizard Trainer, at least.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mara_jade=awkward,At least this is non-canon.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:human=happy,Humans really are the best!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss=pumped,A bone-chilling performance!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity=awkward,You okay? With your b-butt, I mean.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:hope=awkward,Wonder how Shulk would feel about all this...
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=pumped,Not today, DMG!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=thinking,I believe this is where you'd say "get owned"? Am I using that right?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:zoey=stunned,You're a true Survivor! You made that look like it was nothing!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=pumped,A bone-chilling performance!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyoko=thinking,...Is she broken?
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:florina=pumped,Well, you know what they say: archers beat Pegasus Knights!

3-male_must_masturbate,target:corrin_m=beat,I mean, I'd play this route.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:xander=smug,Go ahead, Xander. I want to be impressed by your "machismo".
3-male_must_masturbate,target:kira=smug,Don't underestimate us.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:caleb=thinking,So catboys do it the same way as humans, right?
3-male_must_masturbate,target:mettaton=beat,What else is there? You've already made a strong impression on us.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:shaggy=beat,Just gonna... keep on not watching you...
3-male_must_masturbate,target:ryu=awkward,Not so much an A-tier here, are you?
3-male_must_masturbate,target:fred=beat,I just wanted to win. I never wanted <i>this</i>.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,You okay there? I can't really tell, since you have a great poker face.
3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america=sad,At least I sort of knew what I was getting into. What a rude awakening for the Cap...
3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Do you even know how to do this? You don't exactly look like the type who does...
3-male_start_masturbating,target:ryu=beat,I don't really have a right to judge you.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:shaggy=smug,Not quite yet. But we are reaching the climax!
3-male_start_masturbating,target:link=calm,And now you have to get yourself out.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:corrin_m=surprised,Wow, this might be an even worse case than me...
3-male_start_masturbating,target:human=smug,Oh, don't worry. I won't stare. There are far more attractive things to look at here. Like the cards.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_america=awkward,But you actually have some idea of what you're doing, so it sort of balances out.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:jin=thinking,<i>Now</i> you're clamming up? Weird...
3-male_start_masturbating,target:fred=sad,I think we lost him.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=beat,Ah, so you do know.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:caleb=surprised,I'd never laugh, Caleb! I know exactly how you feel.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:xander=awkward,Sorry if this is rude, but I don't believe you. Like, at all.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=shy,Didn't realize you two were that close.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=loss,Please. Just... don't.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=sad,I respect you too much to watch. I'll just... focus elsewhere.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=beat,Annnnd Mewtwo's back.
3-male_start_masturbating,target:mettaton=stunned,...Oh. Has that guy been here the whole time?
3-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=annoyed,(Good thing it's not just the two of us. I can ignore the vampire slayer and not feel as guilty.)
3-male_masturbating,target:jin,priority:0=awkward,You're still somehow more collected than I am. You're pretty cool.
3-male_masturbating,target:caleb,priority:0=shy,(...Is he purring?)
3-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,(Is it bad I'd rather be doing anything else than watch this chef?)
3-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=angry,Uggggh... this is taking forever.
3-male_masturbating,target:shaggy,priority:0=loss,(Stop making me hungry, dang it!)
3-male_masturbating,target:mettaton,priority:0=happy,Real drama! Real action! Real fanservice?
3-male_masturbating,target:kira,priority:0=stunned,(This guy's telling us his life story now? Hard to think he was so secretive earlier.)
3-male_masturbating,target:link,priority:0=thinking,I can't tell if your prowess with the sword is helping here or not...
3-male_masturbating,target:9s=shy,So 9s, does it, you know... function?
3-male_masturbating,target:captain_falcon,priority:0=loss,(Must not watch... must... not... watch...)
3-male_masturbating,target:kira,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:0=angry,Stop staring at her while... doing that! It's creepy!
3-male_masturbating,target:corrin_m,priority:0=awkward,Corrin's just... doing his own thing over there.
3-male_masturbating,target:fred,priority:0=sad,(I kinda pity him. After all, I care too much about things like this too.)
3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=shy,What an interesting way of doing it.
3-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=shy,(Seriously, never expected Ryu to have <i>that</i> in his pants.)
3-male_masturbating,target:captain_america,priority:0=annoyed,Just as a reminder, he's taken performance enhancing drugs.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=happy,Good show, ~player~, good show.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:link=joking,I'm sure there was a good reason he lost, but I can't find the <i>link</i>.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=pumped,No glitches here!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:shaggy=pumped,Okay! <i>Now</i> roll credits!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:caleb=stunned,...So that just happened.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=calm,I never had a crush myself. But this seems kind of sweet.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=happy,You're still unmatched in speed, Captain! I'm impressed!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:mettaton=pumped,Robot defused!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=surprised,You ever get that feeling when you wake up and the room's just a little too bright? That's what that felt like right now.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryu=calm,That's one Hadouken I'm glad I didn't get hit by.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shy,Let's just forget tonight ever happened, Corrin.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=pumped,And now to never speak of this again.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander=beat,Miss your friend? ...I do too, sometimes. Maybe I should pay them a visit.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:fred=awkward,Guess that's it then. But hey, you did your best, Freddy.
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_america=pumped,Patriotic <i>and</i> erotic! Patri-erotic!
3-male_finished_masturbating,target:kira=shy,Is it over?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:chell=happy,If you talked, I wouldn't mind letting you skip the forfeit. Anyone else?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:velma=awkward,Ah, good job. But, uh, well...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:tina=shy,Welp. This is hapening now.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:daisy=beat,Uh, wow. You took that super well for a princess.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:lilith=beat,Yeah, I guess so. That's that.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:hope=joking,Guess Lucina was wrong. Hope <i>can</i> die. Figuratively, of course.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:videl=smug,This fight is over! And for once, it didn't take multiple episodes.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:seven=joking,Looks like you rolled a One that time.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:april=pumped,Delivery imminent!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rosalina=pumped,So a top seed has been eliminated. Nice! Er, no offense.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:launch=smug,Maybe you should've paid more attention instead of just making fun of us!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:saki=beat,Sheesh. Why do I feel so bad about this?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=sad,I'm begging you, <i>please</i> don't use your weapon for this.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:leela=stunned,What are you doing? Are you getting something?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=awkward,Oh, don't be a baby. Even I'll do the forfeit.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:shantae=awkward,Time for a different type of show, Shantae.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:hermione=victory,Guess knowing how to play isn't everything after all!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=beat,Well, here we go...  what a night this turned out to be.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:chara=awkward,Phew... Chara finally lost...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=smug,The Huntress became the prey, it seems.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:lara=awkward,She fell into a pretty big trap.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=shy,That's the tragic nature of this game. But you knew what you were getting into, at least.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:paya=determined,Can do.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=thinking,A love fairy's gotta be real experienced doing this sort of gig, right? This should be a treat.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:meg=calm,Time to put that stamina training to good use.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,So is this what humans call "pornography"?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:penny=shy,You poor soul... this really is a ruthless game.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss=beat,Talk about a fall from grace.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:faye=joking,Well, as they say, all's Faye-r in love and war!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=beat,Why am I not surprised at this?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:neo=shy,What's that look supposed to mean? You're sending mixed signals...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:zoey=awkward,Still better than running from zombies, I bet.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So... do both of you do the forfeit?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:annie=beat,Oh, so you're... experienced?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:monika=shy,I'm sure this is something you're not used to, Monika, but you'll do great! ~player~ is here to help, after all!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:evie,marker:puns=joking,And Evie's out. How cold.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:orendi=beat,A four-armed forfeit. As if this couldn't get any weirder.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:zizou=stunned,Well then...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:annie_leonhart=awkward,You took that rather well, huh?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=surprised,What? Am I seeing double?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=pumped,Maybe you should've stuck to board games!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:aiyana=stunned,So that's it? For real now?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:ami=calm,Ami lost, huh? Wonder how a famous model like her does it.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=surprised,I'm sorry, Natsuki. If I could help you, I would...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=happy,I beat a half-demon without killing them! That's a first.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=thinking,Play?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:uravity=shy,Sorry, Uravity. But at least you can show off how cool your power is!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:tracer=awkward,Looks like you're out of time. Get it?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:jasmine=calm,So... it's come to this. Good luck Jasmine, you're out.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:twilight=joking,Looks like we've entered the twilight of this match.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:jane=happy,Maybe we should have her do a different punishment. Let's brainstorm something, eh?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=shy,You aren't going to shave for your forfeit too, are you?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:ann=thinking,And Ann's out. Are we really going to make her masturbate?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:piper=beat,Time to start, Piper.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:velma_classic=shy,Do this often?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:beatrix=pumped,Sometimes skill can't always beat luck, Beatrix.

3-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=surprised,You're going right for it? Don't you have to warm up, or something?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=shy,Maybe this was inevitable... either way, might as well enjoy it, right?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:monika=devoted,Just like that! ...I think. I've never seen someone do this before tonight, so you really shouldn't ask me for advice.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy=awkward,Guess you're right, as long as no one here leaks it.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sonya=awkward,Not gonna lie, this is very therapeutic.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amy_rose=joking,I hope that checkpoint was before the game began.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=happy,Sure. Do it however you want. Fast, slow, I don't really care.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:ami=determined,Don't worry! You can trust me to not stare!

3-female_start_masturbating,target:neo=sad,What do you want me to say? I can't figure you out at all...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:lux=happy,Heh. You going like that reminds me of the Lightning Chariot's Lux. Just need Phos, I guess.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=embarrassed,That's not really necessary, but okay, I guess.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:mercy=thinking,Did you say something?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=shy,(Wait, is she really going to dance as she does it?)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:blake=embarrassed,Let's just let her do her thing.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=awkward,And that's a good thing.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:seven=stunned,You could've fooled me.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=surprised,...This is already a little depressing...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,Sorry, that was rude. Don't turn me into tempura, please.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:mileena=victory,I enjoy the fact that you lost, if nothing else.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:leela=beat,Moving right along...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=beat,I think you're a little more intoxicated than you think.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sheva=shy,Yes, please do.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=surprised,N-no! No. No? ...Is that how you're supposed to?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sheena_classic=victory,Guess you get to see what it's like.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen=embarrassed,Hoo boy... I can see... everything...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:angie=shy,Well, she lost, so can't really ask for much more.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:tina=stunned,That was a quick turnaround!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=pumped,Alright! Plus Super! ...I swear it sounded better in my head.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:pyrrha=happy,Still, this might be just what you could use.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Is she a humanoid too?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in their place...)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alice=annoyed,Don't look at her... rabbit hole, ~player~. It's rude.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:gogo=awkward,Did I do that? I mean, I know I'm incredibly handsome, but...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:tifa=beat,Not even gonna sit down or anything? Sure, whatever floats your boat.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=embarrassed,Nono... I'm just fine like this, thank you.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=beat,I was gonna keep my distance regardless.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Can't stop you, huh? At least try not to fire it..
3-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I guess that makes sense. Cats love their toys, after all.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,Wait, you're going to <i>wrestle</i>?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena=beat,I'll just... let you be.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=shy,Time to see an expert at work, I guess.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=embarrassed,Really? Dang, my usual Space Pirates are <i>way</i> more asexual than you!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:uhura=shy,(Sorry ~player~, but it's better you than me getting her attention.)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:mei,marker:puns=joking,Now, hope you don't get <i>cold feet</i>.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:zizou=shy,So you have to do it too. This game really doesn't make exceptions for anyone.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=stunned,Oh, I'd love to hear this song!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:marceline=pumped,What time is it? Showtime!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:piper=awkward,Good thing this isn't your home.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:meg=happy,And there you go, like a pegasus out of its stable.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=beat,Yeah, doesn't really work as well when the audience can't see the action.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:faye=beat,Okay, I'll stop. You do your thing.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=beat,Top of the list of things I didn't expect to see today...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised,It was a joke! You're not going to hurt us with that, are you?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=happy,Still! Good job, everyone! We got the moral victory.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:marinette=determined,If you're having trouble, try to imagine it like the whole world's fate rests in this performance!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elena=sad,I pity the poor girl. No one deserves to do this against their will.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:samus=loss,Vigilance... vigilance...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:evie=shy,Here she goes.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:mara_jade=annoyed,Well, that's certainly not dangerous at all.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:saki=sad,It is that time I guess...this is why I was against the game in the first place.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:riva=shy,I feel so graced.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Is there such thing as a wet nightmare?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:daphne=awkward,'Danger Prone'? You could call any of us that, and it would probably fit.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:pearl=shy,I don't think this is what people mean when they ask to see your "pearly whites".
3-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru=shy,Go ahead and take your time, Mahiru.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=happy,I bet you'll make this hot... y'know, because you have fire.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn=shy,I'll try not to mention this to your friends back home.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=stunned,Wait, she's a real girl now?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=angry,For real this time! No looking!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer=pumped,Well, as ol' Sonic used to say, "Gotta go fast!"
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayla=happy,I do think about it a lot, but never during something like this.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=loss,(C'mon, Pit, don't be a pervert. Take your eyes off Nugi-chan.)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:orendi=shy,(I'll watch. A little bit, just to satisfy my morbid curiosity.)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:paya=beat,So, uh... why do they call you Paya?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:lilith=thinking,Will there be any powers involved in this?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f=thinking,It's hard to imagine, but I guess your whole army <i>is</i> really horny...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,I really am sorry about this, Mahiru.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kurumu=smug,So, you reveal your true form!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=shy,I didn't say something too harsh, did I?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=embarrassed,R-Revy! That's too far! The forfeit said nothing about sex!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyoko=awkward,Give it everything you got, I guess?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:meia=shy,Y-You say that like you expect to masturbate standing up again...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart=thinking,(So this is how an "adnormal" girl does it?)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:willow=embarrassed,Yeah... wait, what?!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:ciri=embarrassed,<i>Wow</i>, that was a shift in attitude.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=awkward,I just stick with "who" myself.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=devoted,Couldn't have put it better myself, Mei.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_will_moan=surprised,Moans? Hoooo boy.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=beat,Check-ups are gonna be a lot more awkward after tonight.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_wet=beat,I'm not willing to go over and verify that... I'll just take your word on it.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerf=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in her place...)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=beat,Oh! Uh. Good... name?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kim,alsoPlaying:shego=thinking,How worse are we talking? There's not many more humiliating positions to be in.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Doing this in front of your friend... let's hope this never leaves this building.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:peach=thinking,(Not sure what she's implying... probably better off not knowing)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Don't let her get in your head Kim!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=calm,(Man, this is satisfying.)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Hey, don't worry about Shego. You beat her, after all.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:daria,alsoPlaying:jane=devoted,Nice to see such good friends bonding.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't. I'd get performance anxiety too.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=stunned,Whoa, what? What are those?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:yang=surprised,I can't help it! I need to see if you'll get off with a Yang!
3-female_start_masturbating,target:korra=sad,Er, sorry. I'm just sorry.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,I'm... not much of a music guy, anyway.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=joking,How good is your hand-eye coordination?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,Just give it up, Juri. She's clearly not interested.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va=joking,I hope your APM count is accurate...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:zelda=shy,S-So you're new to this too? That's reassuring.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:d.va=shy,Right. "Leaked".
3-female_start_masturbating,target:annie=shy,I'll only look if you want me too, okay?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,If you don't want to watch, Ann, just look somewhere else. That's what I do when I'm feeling... overwhelmed.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:chun-li=shy,I'll just let you get to it, I guess.

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika=thinking,This is a really wholesome thing we have going here, but somehow I still feel like something's wrong...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:black_canary=sad,Oww... my ears...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:hermione=shy,That has to be the second weirdest usage of souls I've ever seen.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sharla=victory,Sharla, your skill is truly unrivalled. At least in this department.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:samus=embarrassed,.........
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:samus=shy,This was one battle I'm glad I won.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:shazza=pumped,Did you see that thunder?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:beatrix=calm,Feeling better? Good.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:ayano=devoted,Oh, you meant ~player~? Boy, I totally misunderstood the situation.

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=pumped,Not today, DMG!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=thinking,I believe this is where you'd say "get owned"? Am I using that right?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=pumped,Must've been a great workout!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba=awkward,I felt like I learnt a lot today.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=pumped,A bone-chilling performance!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:hope=awkward,Wonder how Shulk would feel about all this...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss=pumped,A bone-chilling performance!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:lux=pumped,I prefer the term 'Final Smash', but that <i>was</i> pretty good.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=happy,Nice finish! I could really feel the excitement, you know?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:dawn=shy,You've got more stamina in you than that one Charizard Trainer, at least.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan=happy,Oh, so that's what a fap is. Fitting.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kurumu=pumped,Well, it was a nice try, servant of the Underworld. Light wins again!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uhura=beat,Whew! Finally over....
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=joking,I guess as long as you're happy... and ~player~, too, by the look of it.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:korra=stunned,That must have been a really powerful orgasm. You're eyes rolled back all the way!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=happy,Hey, you should be proud! You completely outlasted her, even when she forced herself on you! Very respectable.

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:marceline,alsoPlaying:buffy=beat,Guess we're all Vampire Slayers now. Except Buffy. She's, like, a Super Slayer now.

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=smug,Taking it easy on her, I see. Maybe you do have a soft spot for her.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:clover=embarrassed,N-No, of course not! I just... didn't think you felt that way about me...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=awkward,Does Recall work that way?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Valkyrie down! Wait, haven't I used this one already?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jasmine=victory,Your disguise was prophetic in a way, huh?

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking,Valkyrie offline! Wait, am I repeating myself?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:gogo=beat,Geez... I'd probably be less red-faced if you <i>won</i> the game.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:willow=angry,You're do- hey! You stole my line!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=happy,Great job, ~name~! Who knew all she needed to calm down a little was... that.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheena_classic=awkward,That'll be an awkward conversation, I bet...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=surprised,Was that the jumpscare? I, uh, wasn't scared. At all!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=awkward,Heh, figures a porn game mascot would have a little masochistic side...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:velma=surprised,I hope that cushion's washable.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:piper=annoyed,I better not see this in the paper tomorrow.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:daphne=smug,'Jeepers'? Really? That's way more embarrassing than anything we've seen from you!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:ruby=victory,The petals scatter.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:arwen=awkward,IThe whole premise is humiliating, yeah, but you certainly look like you enjoyed it.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jura=devoted,I'm glad for this experience, Jura. It's nice to interact with Space Pirates without them trying to kill me.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=joking,Yeah, you should probably clean all that, uh... stardew.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:harley=victory,Heh. That's certainly an interesting take on the old "squirting flower" gag!

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:daisy=pumped,Consider those petals plucked!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko=pumped,Finishing strike!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:alpha=happy,Okay, that was actually pretty cool. Great voice, too!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:ciri=beat,I'll just chalk it up as a draw.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=devoted,What a <i>Vigor</i>-ous show!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=happy,I wonder whose hands those are... and if they know what they're touching...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=beat,Good thing that's not a digital camera, huh? ...It <i>isn't</i>, right?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:pearl=pumped,In your gemface!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aiyana=sad,What was that shriek? I'm fine... but still, keep it down please...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Whose name did you  just say?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elena=awkward,And now she's just standing there for anyone to look at. Wonderful.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=pumped,Flame extinguished!

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=beat,He's a busy man, but I'll do my best.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:asuna=devoted,I bet this Kirito person is proud of you, at least!

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jane=pumped,Guess Jane made it rain!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=devoted,May Lady Palutena bless you.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=beat,Well, this must be awkward to come back to. Naked and sticky...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:gwen=pumped,You really left us <i>hanging by a thread</i> there.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=pumped,And good night!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=embarrassed,Naked, wet, and with your legs over your head. Ayep, definitely a disgraceful look for a princess... sorry.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:riva=pumped,Learn some humility yet?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,I, uh, do not.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pumped,Talk about a tag team match!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:pauling=awkward,Contract complete?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:rosalina=happy,Do I get a Power Star for this?

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:yang=pumped,Flaming hot!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=beat,I think the paella's a little sour right now... let's let her simmer for a bit.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=victory,At least we all got to see a full Moon.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:paya=annoyed,Yeah. Exciting.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:zelda=surprised,Yikes! That got my heart pumping more than your Final Smash.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:saki=beat,So I've noticed.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:peach=awkward,I would've preferred a cake as my reward, but whatever.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa=joking,Let's give her a hand! ...Applause, I mean.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:leela=sad,I'll probably remember that when I go into my next battle. Thanks a lot.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:april=shy,I hope there isn't actually a studio involved.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:annie=surprised,You're shivering. Do you... need help with anything?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mei=pumped,A-mei-zing!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:chell=awkward,It's always such a pleasure.

3-female_finished_masturbating,target:marinette=stunned,That was incredible! You've got the makings of a hero, alright! Maybe sometime... we could... never mind.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li=awkward,So what button input made you do <i>that</i> move?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:vriska=surprised,Ew! Is that... blood? That's... that's just disgusting!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl=pumped,You were a strong opponent. But I was stronger!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:neo=pumped,I always knew floor ice cream was healthy!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:tifa=pumped,Cue the victory fanfare!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sheva=thinking,Uh, really? Can I ask <i>why</i> you cried that out?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:blake=shy,Would it be insulting if I asked to pet your head?

#lost tunic
4-male_must_masturbate,target:corrin_m=beat,I mean, I'd play this route.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:xander=smug,Go ahead, Xander. I want to be impressed by your "machismo".
4-male_must_masturbate,target:jin=smug,You talked a good game, but it wasn't enough, old man.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,You okay there? I can't really tell, since you have a great poker face.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america=sad,At least I sort of knew what I was getting into. What a rude awakening for the Cap...
4-male_must_masturbate,target:mettaton=beat,What else is there? You've already made a strong impression on us.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:kira=smug,Don't underestimate us.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:ryu=awkward,Not so much an A-tier here, are you?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:link=devoted,Thank Lady Palutena, Link didn't win for once!
4-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=awkward,Whaddya know? I beat Captain Falcon!
4-male_must_masturbate,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=calm,I can tell. <i>Mr. Game and Watch</i> moves more than you.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:fred=beat,I just wanted to win. I never wanted <i>this</i>.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:shaggy=beat,Just gonna... keep on not watching you...
4-male_must_masturbate,target:caleb=thinking,So catboys do it the same way as humans, right?
4-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Do you even know how to do this? You don't exactly look like the type who does...
4-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=sad,I respect you too much to watch. I'll just... focus elsewhere.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:ryu=beat,I don't really have a right to judge you.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:fred=sad,I think we lost him.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:xander=awkward,Sorry if this is rude, but I don't believe you. Like, at all.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:caleb=surprised,I'd never laugh, Caleb! I know exactly how you feel.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:jin=thinking,<i>Now</i> you're clamming up? Weird...
4-male_start_masturbating,target:human=smug,Oh, don't worry. I won't stare. There are far more attractive things to look at here. Like the cards.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_america=awkward,But you actually have some idea of what you're doing, so it sort of balances out.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:shaggy=smug,Not quite yet. But we are reaching the climax!
4-male_start_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=shy,Didn't realize you two were that close.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=loss,Please. Just... don't.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:link=calm,And now you have to get yourself out.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=beat,Annnnd Mewtwo's back.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:corrin_m=surprised,Wow, this might be an even worse case than me...
4-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=beat,Ah, so you do know.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:mettaton=stunned,...Oh. Has that guy been here the whole time?
4-male_masturbating,target:captain_america,priority:0=annoyed,Just as a reminder, he's taken performance enhancing drugs.
4-male_masturbating,target:jin,priority:0=awkward,You're still somehow more collected than I am. You're pretty cool.
4-male_masturbating,target:shaggy,priority:0=loss,(Stop making me hungry, dang it!)
4-male_masturbating,target:mettaton,priority:0=happy,Real drama! Real action! Real fanservice?
4-male_masturbating,target:kira,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:0=angry,Stop staring at her while... doing that! It's creepy!
4-male_masturbating,target:corrin_m,priority:0=awkward,Corrin's just... doing his own thing over there.
4-male_masturbating,target:caleb,priority:0=shy,(...Is he purring?)
4-male_masturbating,target:captain_falcon,priority:0=loss,(Must not watch... must... not... watch...)
4-male_masturbating,target:fred,priority:0=sad,(I kinda pity him. After all, I care too much about things like this too.)
4-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,(Is it bad I'd rather be doing anything else than watch this chef?)
4-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=angry,Uggggh... this is taking forever.
4-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=annoyed,(Good thing it's not just the two of us. I can ignore the vampire slayer and not feel as guilty.)
4-male_masturbating,target:kira,priority:0=stunned,(This guy's telling us his life story now? Hard to think he was so secretive earlier.)
4-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=shy,What an interesting way of doing it.
4-male_masturbating,target:9s=shy,So 9s, does it, you know... function?
4-male_masturbating,target:link,priority:0=thinking,I can't tell if your prowess with the sword is helping here or not...
4-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=shy,(Seriously, never expected Ryu to have <i>that</i> in his pants.)
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryu=calm,That's one Hadouken I'm glad I didn't get hit by.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:link=joking,I'm sure there was a good reason he lost, but I can't find the <i>link</i>.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:caleb=stunned,...So that just happened.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=pumped,And now to never speak of this again.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:fred=awkward,Guess that's it then. But hey, you did your best, Freddy.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:kira=shy,Is it over?
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_america=pumped,Patriotic <i>and</i> erotic! Patri-erotic!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=pumped,No glitches here!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=calm,I never had a crush myself. But this seems kind of sweet.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=happy,You're still unmatched in speed, Captain! I'm impressed!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=surprised,You ever get that feeling when you wake up and the room's just a little too bright? That's what that felt like right now.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:shaggy=pumped,Okay! <i>Now</i> roll credits!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander=beat,Miss your friend? ...I do too, sometimes. Maybe I should pay them a visit.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=happy,Good show, ~player~, good show.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:mettaton=pumped,Robot defused!
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shy,Let's just forget tonight ever happened, Corrin.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalMales:4,totalAlive:5=embarrassed,W-what is that? ...I'm just gonna pretend it's food and never ask again.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_v4=beat,Talk about a fall from grace.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:riva=angry,Don't be such a baby! We <i>all</i> have to follow the rules, so just do it!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=shy,Do you really want me to watch you, Ms. Fit? You aren't weirded out that your friend will be watching you?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=surprised,Oh sweet Palutena they multiplied.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyoko=beat,The Ultimate Detective, reduced to this. What a night.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sheena_classic=pumped,A woman of your word. I like that.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:hermione=victory,Guess knowing how to play isn't everything after all!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway? Sounds fancy.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mei=shy,That's the tragic nature of this game. But you knew what you were getting into, at least.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss=beat,Talk about a fall from grace.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=awkward,Sorry, Mia. The miracle never happen. I mean, happened.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=thinking,A love fairy's gotta be real experienced doing this sort of gig, right? This should be a treat.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:piper=beat,Time to start, Piper.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elena=surprised,Did no one tell her? That's a bit too much, isn't it?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,I get it. You two are close.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:videl=smug,This fight is over! And for once, it didn't take multiple episodes.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:tina=shy,Welp. This is hapening now.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:korra=awkward,As a bender this should be easy for you, maybe?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sheva=smug,Betcha prefer the zombies, huh? Well, uh, too bad.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=victory,At least you beat her. That's gotta count for something, right Chun-Li?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:buffy=joking,Guess the slayer was slayed tonight.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:velma_classic=shy,Do this often?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aimee=sad,I'm begging you, <i>please</i> don't use your weapon for this.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=awkward,Oh, don't be a baby. Even I'll do the forfeit.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:gwen=thinking,Um, what are you doing, Gwen?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:joey=beat,Well, here we go...  what a night this turned out to be.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=smug,No snarky quips left, Shego?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=smug,Hey, Captain, I think she wants you to watch! Make sure you look <i>long and hard</i> at Corrin's performance!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:dark_magician_girl=smug,Not surprising. You don't even have a real name!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chun-li=awkward,Sorry, Chun-Li. You need more practice, I guess.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kimberly=beat,Ouch. Poor gal.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:lara=awkward,She fell into a pretty big trap.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mileena=stunned,I'm truly shocked at this turn of events. No one could have seen this coming.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=beat,*sigh* Never mind.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:harley,totalAlive:5=smug,Well, Harley's not winning this.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=awkward,(Good news is I don't think she wants my head anymore.)
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sei=awkward,Sei's out. But to be honest, I think she stopped playing seriously like, four stages ago.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:marinette=beat,Well, Marinette lost. (Can't say I'm entirely displeased with this turn of events...)
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_thought_better=beat,Someone had to lose first... sorry it had to be you.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:jubilee=awkward,Looks like you were mostly just talk.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:tifa=shy,Sounds crazy, I know. But them's the rules.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu,totalAlive:5=stunned,I don't know whether to be impressed or sorry for you.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mara_jade=calm,Ah well. Maybe you should've tried some other game. I'm sure your galaxy's got a million of them.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:marceline=thinking,Do you have the same... bodily fluids as living humans?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:samus=sad,Oh... S-Samus...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mercy=stunned,When did you do that? Am I out of the loop?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:5=shy,I guess I wouldn't mind a tutorial...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_should_be_fun=happy,I bet it is.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck2=thinking,Tell me if you don't want me to look. You look a little on edge, Mahiru...

4-female_must_masturbate,target:misty=stunned,(Pest?)
4-female_must_masturbate,target:lyn=embarrassed,You're really going to too dat? I mean, do that?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:2-4=awkward,Glad you're being a good sport about it.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_one_of_a_kind=smug,Maybe not one-of-a-kind, but this'll be the first of it's kind I'll get.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:scarlet_witch=annoyed,I can already tell that this will go great.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:may=smug,And now the Coordinator takes center stage.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ryuko=pumped,Haha! Got ya!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:lilith=beat,Yeah, I guess so. That's that.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:saki=beat,Sheesh. Why do I feel so bad about this?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=awkward,Hope you know about the forfeit. Mostly 'cause even I still don't get it completely.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:streaming-chan=angry,You failed me, chat!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=thinking,Seriously... get a better gender ratio next time.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shantae=awkward,Time for a different type of show, Shantae.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:shazza=pumped,Ding-dong! The dingo's out!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=smug,You lost because you were going against the one and only Pit!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:launch=smug,Maybe you should've paid more attention instead of just making fun of us!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rosalina=pumped,So a top seed has been eliminated. Nice! Er, no offense.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:hope=joking,Guess Lucina was wrong. Hope <i>can</i> die. Figuratively, of course.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:1-4=stunned,What's the story behind that?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:kim=calm,And there's the rub. Literally.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=pumped,Understand now? Lady Palutena is the superior goddess!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=awkward,I can almost taste the bitterness.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:seven=joking,Looks like you rolled a One that time.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misty,totalAlive:5=surprised,She has to do <i>what</i>?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sonya=happy,You got what's coming to you.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meg=calm,Time to put that stamina training to good use.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,So is this what humans call "pornography"?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:leela=stunned,What are you doing? Are you getting something?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=beat,It really wouldn't surprise me if she was wanted for public indecency...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:5=shy,You didn't know either, huh?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:spooky=happy,Hey, we did it! We beat a ghost!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ruby=smug,The Huntress became the prey, it seems.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:jura=beat,You don't have men where you're from, right?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:black_canary,totalAlive:5=awkward,<i>Mind</i> if I use that excuse?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:velma=awkward,Ah, good job. But, uh, well...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_win_win=shy,That's almost flattering...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:sayla=surprised,Sayla, prepare for buttle-I mean battle! Battle!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:gogo=shy,I think I can tell.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:paya=determined,Can do.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:zoey=awkward,Still better than running from zombies, I bet.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:april=pumped,Delivery imminent!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:neo=shy,What's that look supposed to mean? You're sending mixed signals...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:moon=beat,Why am I not surprised at this?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:daisy=beat,Uh, wow. You took that super well for a princess.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:faye=joking,Well, as they say, all's Faye-r in love and war!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=surprised,M-Me? Why?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:annie=beat,Oh, so you're... experienced?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:asuna=awkward,Did Asuna lose? Wasn't expecting that.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:jane=happy,Maybe we should have her do a different punishment. Let's brainstorm something, eh?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:felicia=shy,You aren't going to shave for your forfeit too, are you?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:black_canary=embarrassed,Do all heroes fantasize about each other?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:calisto=beat,You lost, but you don't seem very upset about it.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ann=thinking,And Ann's out. Are we really going to make her masturbate?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:uhura=smug,Go ahead, Uhura. The stage is yours. And I hope I've been saying that right.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=stunned,Not even the Ultimate Gamer could win this...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:zelda=joking,Don't worry, Zelda. I'm sure you'll make it a magical performance.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:zizou=stunned,Well then...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:rainbow_mika=beat,So... do both of you do the forfeit?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chell=happy,If you talked, I wouldn't mind letting you skip the forfeit. Anyone else?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chara=awkward,Phew... Chara finally lost...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:jasmine=calm,So... it's come to this. Good luck Jasmine, you're out.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:tracer=awkward,Looks like you're out of time. Get it?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:uravity=shy,Sorry, Uravity. But at least you can show off how cool your power is!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=happy,I beat a half-demon without killing them! That's a first.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nagisa=thinking,Play?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=surprised,I'm sorry, Natsuki. If I could help you, I would...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:aiyana=stunned,So that's it? For real now?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ami=calm,Ami lost, huh? Wonder how a famous model like her does it.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:peach=pumped,Maybe you should've stuck to board games!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=surprised,What? Am I seeing double?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena=embarrassed,W-Whoa.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:twilight=joking,Looks like we've entered the twilight of this match.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:annie_leonhart=awkward,You took that rather well, huh?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:orendi=beat,A four-armed forfeit. As if this couldn't get any weirder.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:beatrix=pumped,Sometimes skill can't always beat luck, Beatrix.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:corrin_f=devoted,She's finally out, thank goodness. I was getting worried.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:monika=shy,I'm sure this is something you're not used to, Monika, but you'll do great! ~player~ is here to help, after all!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:evie,marker:puns=joking,And Evie's out. How cold.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:blake=beat,Poor girl. I feel bad, exposing her secret and now this...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pearl=beat,This shouldn't be so bad... it's not like this Pearl will shoot me with electric balls...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:lux=awkward,Maybe you shouldn't have told everyone your plan like a cartoon villain.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ciri=calm,Guess that's it for Ciri then, huh?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:chica=annoyed,Where can I file a formal complaint?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:willow=pumped,The fair Willow, down for the count!

4-female_must_masturbate,target:d.va_cruiser=happy,Time to rev up that engine!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:ayano=surprised,Sorry, I watch everyone the same. Wait, no, I mean I watch everyone the same amount. No, I mean I don't watch anyone!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:harley=beat,Really, we're all losers here. Or... all winners. Or something.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,She'll be a great teacher for you, I'm sure.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:daria=sad,I should feel bad for Daria, but...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=pumped,No hacks required to beat Futaba!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:angie=thinking,Not going to pull another deus ex machina on us?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:pyrrha=beat,Rules are rules, Pyrrha.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,I've been waiting for this, ~name~...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:amy_rose=awkward,Amy's out? Do hedgehogs masturbate too?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elaine=pumped,Looks like Elaine's walking the plank!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:d.va=happy,Well, this suddenly got very interesting.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:penny=shy,You poor soul... this really is a ruthless game.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=smug,Never? A woman of your talents? Please.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=shy,Sorry, Arwen... at least you're taking it in stride.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:daphne=pumped,Daphne may have lost, but for some reason, that doesn't surprise me.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:blackrose=beat,I can hardly believe it myself...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:alice=smug,So much for prim and proper.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=awkward,I'll do my best to give privacy.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=awkward,Is this really that surprising when you're about as tall as the cards?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=embarrassed,That's not really necessary, but okay, I guess.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:calisto=shy,Wish I could just laugh away the awkwardness of the situation like you. Or should I say <i>Yew</i>?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:ann=angry,Hey, I'm not the type who watches. Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I'm no ~player~!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:black_canary=sad,(Man, I feel kinda guilty watching this Ollie's lover like this.)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_will_moan=surprised,Moans? Hoooo boy.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:monika=devoted,Just like that! ...I think. I've never seen someone do this before tonight, so you really shouldn't ask me for advice.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:marceline=pumped,What time is it? Showtime!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised,It was a joke! You're not going to hurt us with that, are you?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=pumped,Alright! Plus Super! ...I swear it sounded better in my head.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:mei,marker:puns=joking,Now, hope you don't get <i>cold feet</i>.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=happy,Ah! That makes sense now.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=beat,Check-ups are gonna be a lot more awkward after tonight.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_enjoy_the_show=sad,O-okay.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:arwen=joking,Well, if you have that much faith, no point in me worrying, is there?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:ami=determined,Don't worry! You can trust me to not stare!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=embarrassed,Really? Dang, my usual Space Pirates are <i>way</i> more asexual than you!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:zizou=shy,So you have to do it too. This game really doesn't make exceptions for anyone.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:ayano=awkward,(Just shut up and look elsewhere, Pit.)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:velma_classic=happy,Then I guess your glasses won't be necessary.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:lux=happy,Heh. You going like that reminds me of the Lightning Chariot's Lux. Just need Phos, I guess.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy=awkward,Guess you're right, as long as no one here leaks it.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:paya=beat,So, uh... why do they call you Paya?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=beat,No mercy for the new guy, huh?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:velma=thinking,How long has that been here?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised,Y-You're gonna do it while flying?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sayla=happy,I do think about it a lot, but never during something like this.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:beatrix=smug,Wow, you seem angry. A shame, really.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:lara=shy,It's best not to think about it.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=beat,Oh! Uh. Good... name?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elena=sad,I pity the poor girl. No one deserves to do this against their will.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:chell=beat,Yeah, silent protagonists are annoying.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:chica=sad,You haven't even started, but I feel utterly drained...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=smug,Of course! I'm not easy to beat, you know!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,marker:palutenacall=happy,Oh, we're going to dinner now? Let me just grab my stuff.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:jane=beat,Sleep sounds nice. Mind if I take a little nap during this?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,<i>She had another one?</i>
4-female_start_masturbating,target:blake=embarrassed,Let's just let her do her thing.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=shy,(And with how flexible she is? I'm probably going to see something I shouldn't...)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:chun-li=shy,I'll just let you get to it, I guess.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:daria=beat,It never goes away, Daria. Life always finds a way to degrade you, but you get used to it.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,It's a bit surreal, I bet. I can't really give advice since I'm a guy, but try and pretend I'm not even here.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:faye=beat,Okay, I'll stop. You do your thing.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:evie=shy,Here she goes.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kim=shy,Just lie back and enjoy it. I'll... look away.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:chara=victory,Guess all that big talk doesn't mean much now, eh Chara?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:jubilee=happy,Time for a Jubilee jamboree!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,Sorry, that was rude. Don't turn me into tempura, please.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_wet=beat,I'm not willing to go over and verify that... I'll just take your word on it.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=stunned,Wait, she's a real girl now?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:uhura=shy,(Sorry ~player~, but it's better you than me getting her attention.)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerm=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in his place...)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=embarrassed,D-Don't rub it in! I'm sensitive about that.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=embarrassed,Nono... I'm just fine like this, thank you.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:jasmine=beat,You'd be better than me at it, at least.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:human=sad,Oh, f-forgive me... I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena=surprised,This is just seven types of awkward, huh?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:jura=awkward,So this is probably a common thing for you, huh?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:asuna=stunned,Oh, I just remembered what the game was called.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:amy_rose=joking,I hope that checkpoint was before the game began.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Is there such thing as a wet nightmare?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=surprised,N-no! No. No? ...Is that how you're supposed to?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:hope=devoted,Don't lose hope, Hope! It's not the end of the world!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:angie=shy,Well, she lost, so can't really ask for much more.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=happy,I bet you'll make this hot... y'know, because you have fire.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=devoted,Don't let it get you down, Mia! I still believe in you!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:riva=shy,I feel so graced.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,I'm... not much of a music guy, anyway.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,Just give it up, Juri. She's clearly not interested.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=awkward,I just stick with "who" myself.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:zelda=shy,S-So you're new to this too? That's reassuring.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f=thinking,It's hard to imagine, but I guess your whole army <i>is</i> really horny...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=shy,Maybe this was inevitable... either way, might as well enjoy it, right?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:mileena=victory,I enjoy the fact that you lost, if nothing else.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=awkward,And that's a good thing.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=shy,I didn't say something too harsh, did I?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=surprised,...This is already a little depressing...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:neo=sad,What do you want me to say? I can't figure you out at all...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:lilith=thinking,Will there be any powers involved in this?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sheva=shy,Yes, please do.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:d.va=shy,Right. "Leaked".
4-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Doing this in front of your friend... let's hope this never leaves this building.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:leela=beat,Moving right along...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sonya=awkward,Not gonna lie, this is very therapeutic.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:yang=surprised,I can't help it! I need to see if you'll get off with a Yang!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:annie=shy,I'll only look if you want me too, okay?
4-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
4-female_start_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=loss,(C'mon, Pit, don't be a pervert. Take your eyes off Nugi-chan.)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in their place...)
4-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=shy,Time to see an expert at work, I guess.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=devoted,Couldn't have put it better myself, Mei.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:samus=loss,Vigilance... vigilance...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=happy,Still! Good job, everyone! We got the moral victory.
4-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
4-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Don't let her get in your head Kim!

4-female_finished_masturbating=beat,So... yeah. Good job?
4-female_finished_masturbating=awkward,That was enjoyable, I think.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:monika=thinking,This is a really wholesome thing we have going here, but somehow I still feel like something's wrong...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:angie=pumped,Class dismissed!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jasmine=victory,Your disguise was prophetic in a way, huh?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:ayano=devoted,Oh, you meant ~player~? Boy, I totally misunderstood the situation.

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato=pumped,And that's that!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amy_rose=thinking,I dunno. Does she get to keep playing now, Dealer?

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:shego=pumped,There <i>she goes</i>!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:videl=pumped,You were a strong opponent. But I was stronger!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:spooky=surprised,Was that the jumpscare? I, uh, wasn't scared. At all!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:korra=stunned,That must have been a really powerful orgasm. You're eyes rolled back all the way!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:meia=devoted,That was as intense as the Galactic Sea itself!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elena=awkward,And now she's just standing there for anyone to look at. Wonderful.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uhura=beat,Whew! Finally over....
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li=awkward,So what button input made you do <i>that</i> move?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=beat,Well, this must be awkward to come back to. Naked and sticky...

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:buffy=devoted,As far as I'm concerned, you <i>are</i> a normal girl. Hope we can be friends after this!

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aella=beat,I think the paella's a little sour right now... let's let her simmer for a bit.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=victory,At least we all got to see a full Moon.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl,targetSaidMarker:fuck=annoyed,At least you apologized...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:mahiru,marker:mahirucheck3=beat,Good thing that's not a digital camera, huh? ...It <i>isn't</i>, right?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:seven=pumped,That was pretty good. I give it a Seven of Nine!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:lyn=awkward,I think you handled it. Well, at that.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:paya=annoyed,Yeah. Exciting.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:hermione=shy,That has to be the second weirdest usage of souls I've ever seen.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:arwen=awkward,IThe whole premise is humiliating, yeah, but you certainly look like you enjoyed it.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:aiyana=sad,What was that shriek? I'm fine... but still, keep it down please...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=awkward,This race is over. Sorry, Ms. Song.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:marceline,alsoPlaying:buffy=beat,Guess we're all Vampire Slayers now. Except Buffy. She's, like, a Super Slayer now.

4-female_finished_masturbating,target:tina=beat,You know what? I'm just gonna leave it at that.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:marceline,alsoPlaying:xander=beat,Guess we're all Vampire Slayers now. Except Xander. He's, like, a Super Slayer, or something.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei,alsoPlaying:mercy,alsoPlayingStage:8=thinking,Valkyrie down! Wait, haven't I used this one already?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:pyrrha=joking,I guess you could call this a <i>pyrrhic victory</i> for you.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:zizou=happy,I can get you a water if you'd like.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=pumped,And good night!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:evie=devoted,May Lady Palutena bless you.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:riva=pumped,Learn some humility yet?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,I, uh, do not.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy=beat,A lewd performance for a lewd woman.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:yang=pumped,Flaming hot!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=pumped,Talk about a tag team match!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Whose name did you  just say?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:daphne=smug,'Jeepers'? Really? That's way more embarrassing than anything we've seen from you!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=pumped,Flame extinguished!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=shy,I'll... put in a good word.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=awkward,No promises, but I'll see what I can do.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah=beat,He's a busy man, but I'll do my best.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:harley=victory,Heh. That's certainly an interesting take on the old "squirting flower" gag!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:asuna=devoted,I bet this Kirito person is proud of you, at least!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:daisy=pumped,Consider those petals plucked!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:mercy,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking,Valkyrie offline! Wait, am I repeating myself?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rosalina=happy,Do I get a Power Star for this?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:zelda=surprised,Yikes! That got my heart pumping more than your Final Smash.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:kim=awkward,I think your cheerleader came out a little there.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:rinkah,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingStage:9=shy,I hope you two aren't planning on going like that...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia=embarrassed,Naked, wet, and with your legs over your head. Ayep, definitely a disgraceful look for a princess... sorry.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:ciri=beat,I'll just chalk it up as a draw.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=happy,Hey, you should be proud! You completely outlasted her, even when she forced herself on you! Very respectable.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=smug,Taking it easy on her, I see. Maybe you do have a soft spot for her.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:penny=joking,Yeah, you should probably clean all that, uh... stardew.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:piper=annoyed,I better not see this in the paper tomorrow.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:ruby=victory,The petals scatter.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:april=shy,I hope there isn't actually a studio involved.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=happy,Great job, ~name~! Who knew all she needed to calm down a little was... that.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=pumped,Valkyrie down!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:zoey=stunned,You're a true Survivor! You made that look like it was nothing!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:d.va=thinking,I believe this is where you'd say "get owned"? Am I using that right?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:mpuns=devoted,Yes! Finally someone who understands the value of wordplay!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri=joking,I guess as long as you're happy... and ~player~, too, by the look of it.

-3-male_must_masturbate,target:caleb=thinking,So catboys do it the same way as humans, right?
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=calm,I can tell. <i>Mr. Game and Watch</i> moves more than you.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:kira=smug,Don't underestimate us.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_falcon=awkward,Whaddya know? I beat Captain Falcon!
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america=sad,At least I sort of knew what I was getting into. What a rude awakening for the Cap...
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,You okay there? I can't really tell, since you have a great poker face.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:jin=smug,You talked a good game, but it wasn't enough, old man.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:corrin_m=beat,I mean, I'd play this route.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:xander=smug,Go ahead, Xander. I want to be impressed by your "machismo".
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:9s=thinking,Do you even know how to do this? You don't exactly look like the type who does...
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:link=devoted,Thank Lady Palutena, Link didn't win for once!
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:shaggy=beat,Just gonna... keep on not watching you...
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:fred=beat,I just wanted to win. I never wanted <i>this</i>.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:mettaton=beat,What else is there? You've already made a strong impression on us.
-3-male_must_masturbate,target:ryu=awkward,Not so much an A-tier here, are you?
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=sad,I respect you too much to watch. I'll just... focus elsewhere.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:jin=thinking,<i>Now</i> you're clamming up? Weird...
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=loss,Please. Just... don't.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:link=calm,And now you have to get yourself out.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:mettaton=stunned,...Oh. Has that guy been here the whole time?
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:xander=awkward,Sorry if this is rude, but I don't believe you. Like, at all.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=beat,Ah, so you do know.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:human=smug,Oh, don't worry. I won't stare. There are far more attractive things to look at here. Like the cards.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_america=awkward,But you actually have some idea of what you're doing, so it sort of balances out.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:caleb=surprised,I'd never laugh, Caleb! I know exactly how you feel.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:fred=sad,I think we lost him.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:corrin_m=surprised,Wow, this might be an even worse case than me...
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=shy,Didn't realize you two were that close.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:ryu=beat,I don't really have a right to judge you.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=beat,Annnnd Mewtwo's back.
-3-male_start_masturbating,target:shaggy=smug,Not quite yet. But we are reaching the climax!
-3-male_masturbating,target:corrin_m,priority:0=awkward,Corrin's just... doing his own thing over there.
-3-male_masturbating,target:mettaton,priority:0=happy,Real drama! Real action! Real fanservice?
-3-male_masturbating,target:fred,priority:0=sad,(I kinda pity him. After all, I care too much about things like this too.)
-3-male_masturbating,target:captain_america,priority:0=annoyed,Just as a reminder, he's taken performance enhancing drugs.
-3-male_masturbating,target:kira,priority:0=stunned,(This guy's telling us his life story now? Hard to think he was so secretive earlier.)
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin,priority:0=awkward,You're still somehow more collected than I am. You're pretty cool.
-3-male_masturbating,target:shaggy,priority:0=loss,(Stop making me hungry, dang it!)
-3-male_masturbating,target:captain_falcon,priority:0=loss,(Must not watch... must... not... watch...)
-3-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,(Is it bad I'd rather be doing anything else than watch this chef?)
-3-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=angry,Uggggh... this is taking forever.
-3-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=annoyed,(Good thing it's not just the two of us. I can ignore the vampire slayer and not feel as guilty.)
-3-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=shy,(Seriously, never expected Ryu to have <i>that</i> in his pants.)
-3-male_masturbating,target:kira,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:0=angry,Stop staring at her while... doing that! It's creepy!
-3-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=shy,What an interesting way of doing it.
-3-male_masturbating,target:caleb,priority:0=shy,(...Is he purring?)
-3-male_masturbating,target:9s=shy,So 9s, does it, you know... function?
-3-male_masturbating,target:link,priority:0=thinking,I can't tell if your prowess with the sword is helping here or not...
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=happy,You're still unmatched in speed, Captain! I'm impressed!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:caleb=stunned,...So that just happened.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shy,Let's just forget tonight ever happened, Corrin.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=surprised,You ever get that feeling when you wake up and the room's just a little too bright? That's what that felt like right now.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_america=pumped,Patriotic <i>and</i> erotic! Patri-erotic!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=happy,Good show, ~player~, good show.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryu=calm,That's one Hadouken I'm glad I didn't get hit by.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:kira=shy,Is it over?
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:mettaton=pumped,Robot defused!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=calm,I never had a crush myself. But this seems kind of sweet.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:shaggy=pumped,Okay! <i>Now</i> roll credits!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=pumped,And now to never speak of this again.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:link=joking,I'm sure there was a good reason he lost, but I can't find the <i>link</i>.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=pumped,No glitches here!
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander=beat,Miss your friend? ...I do too, sometimes. Maybe I should pay them a visit.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:fred=awkward,Guess that's it then. But hey, you did your best, Freddy.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:natsuki=surprised,I'm sorry, Natsuki. If I could help you, I would...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=surprised,What? Am I seeing double?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:tina=shy,Welp. This is hapening now.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:launch=smug,Maybe you should've paid more attention instead of just making fun of us!

-3-female_start_masturbating,target:arwen=joking,Well, if you have that much faith, no point in me worrying, is there?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:ann=angry,Hey, I'm not the type who watches. Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I'm no ~player~!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:chara=victory,Guess all that big talk doesn't mean much now, eh Chara?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.

-3-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=joking,How good is your hand-eye coordination?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:daphne=awkward,'Danger Prone'? You could call any of us that, and it would probably fit.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:peach=thinking,(Not sure what she's implying... probably better off not knowing)
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=stunned,Whoa, what? What are those?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't. I'd get performance anxiety too.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=stunned,(Now, how creative can an adventure game native get?)
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.

-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kim=shy,Just lie back and enjoy it. I'll... look away.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=shy,(And with how flexible she is? I'm probably going to see something I shouldn't...)
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=shy,(Wait, is she really going to dance as she does it?)
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:seven=stunned,You could've fooled me.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jane=beat,Sleep sounds nice. Mind if I take a little nap during this?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=embarrassed,R-Revy! That's too far! The forfeit said nothing about sex!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.

-1-male_must_masturbate,target:corrin_m=beat,I mean, I'd play this route.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:caleb=thinking,So catboys do it the same way as humans, right?
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:captain_america=sad,At least I sort of knew what I was getting into. What a rude awakening for the Cap...
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:ryu=awkward,Not so much an A-tier here, are you?
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,You okay there? I can't really tell, since you have a great poker face.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:kira=smug,Don't underestimate us.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:xander=smug,Go ahead, Xander. I want to be impressed by your "machismo".
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:jin=smug,You talked a good game, but it wasn't enough, old man.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:fred=beat,I just wanted to win. I never wanted <i>this</i>.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:xander=awkward,Sorry if this is rude, but I don't believe you. Like, at all.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:ryu=beat,I don't really have a right to judge you.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=loss,Please. Just... don't.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=sad,I respect you too much to watch. I'll just... focus elsewhere.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=shy,Didn't realize you two were that close.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:shaggy=smug,Not quite yet. But we are reaching the climax!
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:mettaton=stunned,...Oh. Has that guy been here the whole time?
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:jin=thinking,<i>Now</i> you're clamming up? Weird...
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:corrin_m=surprised,Wow, this might be an even worse case than me...
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:kira=beat,Annnnd Mewtwo's back.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:captain_america=awkward,But you actually have some idea of what you're doing, so it sort of balances out.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:human=smug,Oh, don't worry. I won't stare. There are far more attractive things to look at here. Like the cards.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:link=calm,And now you have to get yourself out.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:9s=beat,Ah, so you do know.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:fred=sad,I think we lost him.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:caleb=surprised,I'd never laugh, Caleb! I know exactly how you feel.
-1-male_masturbating,target:fred,priority:0=sad,(I kinda pity him. After all, I care too much about things like this too.)
-1-male_masturbating,target:caleb,priority:0=shy,(...Is he purring?)
-1-male_masturbating,target:kira,priority:0=stunned,(This guy's telling us his life story now? Hard to think he was so secretive earlier.)
-1-male_masturbating,target:link,priority:0=thinking,I can't tell if your prowess with the sword is helping here or not...
-1-male_masturbating,target:kira,alsoPlaying:palutena,priority:0=angry,Stop staring at her while... doing that! It's creepy!
-1-male_masturbating,target:captain_falcon,priority:0=loss,(Must not watch... must... not... watch...)
-1-male_masturbating,target:shaggy,priority:0=loss,(Stop making me hungry, dang it!)
-1-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=annoyed,(Is it bad I'd rather be doing anything else than watch this chef?)
-1-male_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,priority:0=angry,Uggggh... this is taking forever.
-1-male_masturbating,target:9s=shy,So 9s, does it, you know... function?
-1-male_masturbating,target:jin,priority:0=awkward,You're still somehow more collected than I am. You're pretty cool.
-1-male_masturbating,target:human,priority:0=shy,What an interesting way of doing it.
-1-male_masturbating,target:corrin_m,priority:0=awkward,Corrin's just... doing his own thing over there.
-1-male_masturbating,target:ryu,priority:0=shy,(Seriously, never expected Ryu to have <i>that</i> in his pants.)
-1-male_masturbating,target:mettaton,priority:0=happy,Real drama! Real action! Real fanservice?
-1-male_masturbating,target:xander,priority:0=annoyed,(Good thing it's not just the two of us. I can ignore the vampire slayer and not feel as guilty.)
-1-male_masturbating,target:captain_america,priority:0=annoyed,Just as a reminder, he's taken performance enhancing drugs.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_america=pumped,Patriotic <i>and</i> erotic! Patri-erotic!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:captain_falcon=happy,You're still unmatched in speed, Captain! I'm impressed!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=pumped,No glitches here!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:mettaton=pumped,Robot defused!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:gay_spaghetti_chef=pumped,And now to never speak of this again.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:link=joking,I'm sure there was a good reason he lost, but I can't find the <i>link</i>.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:fred=awkward,Guess that's it then. But hey, you did your best, Freddy.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:caleb=stunned,...So that just happened.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander,alsoPlaying:buffy=calm,I never had a crush myself. But this seems kind of sweet.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=surprised,You ever get that feeling when you wake up and the room's just a little too bright? That's what that felt like right now.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:kira=shy,Is it over?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:shaggy=pumped,Okay! <i>Now</i> roll credits!
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:human=happy,Good show, ~player~, good show.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:corrin_m=shy,Let's just forget tonight ever happened, Corrin.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:xander=beat,Miss your friend? ...I do too, sometimes. Maybe I should pay them a visit.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:ryu=calm,That's one Hadouken I'm glad I didn't get hit by.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:2-4=awkward,Glad you're being a good sport about it.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=surprised,Oh sweet Palutena they multiplied.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan,count-zone-tan_valentine:1=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway? Sounds fancy.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misty,totalAlive:5=surprised,She has to do <i>what</i>?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=smug,Hey, Captain, I think she wants you to watch! Make sure you look <i>long and hard</i> at Corrin's performance!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:pyrrha=beat,Rules are rules, Pyrrha.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu,totalAlive:5=stunned,I don't know whether to be impressed or sorry for you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meia,totalAlive:5=shy,You didn't know either, huh?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:harley,totalAlive:5=smug,Well, Harley's not winning this.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:harley=beat,Really, we're all losers here. Or... all winners. Or something.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:5=shy,I guess I wouldn't mind a tutorial...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:pearl,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=happy,She'll be a great teacher for you, I'm sure.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalAlive:1-4=stunned,What's the story behind that?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:velma_classic=shy,Do this often?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:hope=joking,Guess Lucina was wrong. Hope <i>can</i> die. Figuratively, of course.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha=thinking,So is this what humans call "pornography"?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:black_canary,totalAlive:5=awkward,<i>Mind</i> if I use that excuse?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:hermione=victory,Guess knowing how to play isn't everything after all!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nugi-chan,totalMales:4,totalAlive:5=embarrassed,W-what is that? ...I'm just gonna pretend it's food and never ask again.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:velma=awkward,Ah, good job. But, uh, well...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:zizou,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=pumped,Understand now? Lady Palutena is the superior goddess!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah,totalMales:4=thinking,Seriously... get a better gender ratio next time.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_thought_better=beat,Someone had to lose first... sorry it had to be you.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:videl=smug,This fight is over! And for once, it didn't take multiple episodes.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_should_be_fun=happy,I bet it is.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_one_of_a_kind=smug,Maybe not one-of-a-kind, but this'll be the first of it's kind I'll get.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=shy,I get it. You two are close.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:saki=beat,Sheesh. Why do I feel so bad about this?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=victory,At least you beat her. That's gotta count for something, right Chun-Li?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_win_win=shy,That's almost flattering...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=shy,Sorry, Arwen... at least you're taking it in stride.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:paya=determined,Can do.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:leela=stunned,What are you doing? Are you getting something?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:chiaki=stunned,Not even the Ultimate Gamer could win this...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:kurumu=beat,*sigh* Never mind.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:evie,marker:puns=joking,And Evie's out. How cold.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:korra=awkward,As a bender this should be easy for you, maybe?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:meg=calm,Time to put that stamina training to good use.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:seven=joking,Looks like you rolled a One that time.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:zone-tan=awkward,What's a "fap" anyway?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rosalina=pumped,So a top seed has been eliminated. Nice! Er, no offense.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:annie=beat,Oh, so you're... experienced?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:d.va_cruiser=happy,Time to rev up that engine!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:launch=smug,Maybe you should've paid more attention instead of just making fun of us!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:zoey=awkward,Still better than running from zombies, I bet.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:blake=beat,Poor girl. I feel bad, exposing her secret and now this...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shantae=awkward,Time for a different type of show, Shantae.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:orendi=beat,A four-armed forfeit. As if this couldn't get any weirder.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:neo=shy,What's that look supposed to mean? You're sending mixed signals...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:calisto=beat,You lost, but you don't seem very upset about it.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:lilith=beat,Yeah, I guess so. That's that.

-1-female_must_masturbate,target:mara_jade=calm,Ah well. Maybe you should've tried some other game. I'm sure your galaxy's got a million of them.

-1-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_v4=beat,Talk about a fall from grace.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:florina=awkward,I'll do my best to give privacy.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:wiifitfemale=shy,Do you really want me to watch you, Ms. Fit? You aren't weirded out that your friend will be watching you?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shego=smug,No snarky quips left, Shego?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:yang=smug,Never? A woman of your talents? Please.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:gogo=shy,I think I can tell.

-1-female_must_masturbate,target:buffy=joking,Guess the slayer was slayed tonight.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aella=awkward,Hope you know about the forfeit. Mostly 'cause even I still don't get it completely.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:raven=happy,I beat a half-demon without killing them! That's a first.

-1-female_must_masturbate,target:clover=surprised,M-Me? Why?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:aiyana=stunned,So that's it? For real now?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:dark_magician_girl=smug,Not surprising. You don't even have a real name!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:jane=happy,Maybe we should have her do a different punishment. Let's brainstorm something, eh?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rinkah=shy,Our battle experience means nothing here... sorry, Rinkah.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:revy=awkward,I can almost taste the bitterness.

-1-female_must_masturbate,target:human=happy,I've been waiting for this, ~name~...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:chell=happy,If you talked, I wouldn't mind letting you skip the forfeit. Anyone else?

-1-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=beat,I was gonna keep my distance regardless.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=angry,For real this time! No looking!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:saki=sad,It is that time I guess...this is why I was against the game in the first place.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:orendi=shy,(I'll watch. A little bit, just to satisfy my morbid curiosity.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:pearl=shy,I don't think this is what people mean when they ask to see your "pearly whites".
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in their place...)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kimberly=shy,It's a bit surreal, I bet. I can't really give advice since I'm a guy, but try and pretend I'm not even here.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:joey=happy,Ah! That makes sense now.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:videl=surprised,Y-You're gonna do it while flying?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:human=sad,Oh, f-forgive me... I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything.

-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=surprised,Wait, you're going to <i>wrestle</i>?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:paya=beat,So, uh... why do they call you Paya?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:velma=thinking,How long has that been here?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jane=beat,Sleep sounds nice. Mind if I take a little nap during this?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:samus=loss,Vigilance... vigilance...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:pyrrha=happy,Still, this might be just what you could use.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't blame you.... I felt pretty anxious myself.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:morrigan=happy,Still! Good job, everyone! We got the moral victory.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:lilith=thinking,Will there be any powers involved in this?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena=awkward,It's actually not so bad.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sheena_classic=victory,Guess you get to see what it's like.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mei,marker:puns=joking,Now, hope you don't get <i>cold feet</i>.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan=beat,No mercy for the new guy, huh?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:daria,alsoPlaying:jane=devoted,Nice to see such good friends bonding.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sheva=shy,Yes, please do.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:twilight=thinking,Is she a humanoid too?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mercy=thinking,Did you say something?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish=embarrassed,You're going to... you can't! ~Player~, say something!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba,alsoPlaying:ann=beat,If you don't want to watch, Ann, just look somewhere else. That's what I do when I'm feeling... overwhelmed.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sonya=awkward,Not gonna lie, this is very therapeutic.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:femplayerloss,targetNotSaidMarker:femplayerfinish=embarrassed,R-Revy! That's too far! The forfeit said nothing about sex!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru,totalMales:4=shy,I really am sorry about this, Mahiru.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meg=happy,And there you go, like a pegasus out of its stable.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=calm,(Man, this is satisfying.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:tina=stunned,That was a quick turnaround!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,alsoPlaying:meia=shy,Y-You say that like you expect to masturbate standing up again...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:spooky=beat,Top of the list of things I didn't expect to see today...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=beat,Yeah, doesn't really work as well when the audience can't see the action.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:marinette=determined,If you're having trouble, try to imagine it like the whole world's fate rests in this performance!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kim,alsoPlaying:shego=thinking,How worse are we talking? There's not many more humiliating positions to be in.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn,alsoPlaying:florina=shy,Doing this in front of your friend... let's hope this never leaves this building.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mara_jade=annoyed,Well, that's certainly not dangerous at all.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer=pumped,Well, as ol' Sonic used to say, "Gotta go fast!"
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li=awkward,Just give it up, Juri. She's clearly not interested.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zone-tan,alsoPlaying:d.va=shy,Right. "Leaked".
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mahiru=shy,Go ahead and take your time, Mahiru.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,alsoPlaying:marinette=embarrassed,I'm... not much of a music guy, anyway.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerf=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in her place...)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:neo=sad,What do you want me to say? I can't figure you out at all...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:tifa=beat,Not even gonna sit down or anything? Sure, whatever floats your boat.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:uhura=shy,(Sorry ~player~, but it's better you than me getting her attention.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:competitive=smug,Of course! I'm not easy to beat, you know! They've earned it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rinkah=happy,I bet you'll make this hot... y'know, because you have fire.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=awkward,Hey, don't worry about Shego. You beat her, after all.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:marceline=pumped,What time is it? Showtime!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:lyn=shy,I'll try not to mention this to your friends back home.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:riva=shy,I feel so graced.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,saidMarker:playerm=sad,(I might wind up the one squirming in his place...)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=shy,Are you trying to spread it? I can't really tell from here.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,marker:palutenacall=happy,Oh, we're going to dinner now? Let me just grab my stuff.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shy,Don't let her get in your head Kim!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:poem=beat,Oh! Uh. Good... name?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:rosalina=awkward,So there's the source of your Gravitational Pull.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:ruby=shy,I don't know, but it sure looks interesting.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:tracer,alsoPlaying:mei,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=devoted,Couldn't have put it better myself, Mei.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_wet=beat,I'm not willing to go over and verify that... I'll just take your word on it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:meia=embarrassed,Really? Dang, my usual Space Pirates are <i>way</i> more asexual than you!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:natsuki=shy,Maybe this was inevitable... either way, might as well enjoy it, right?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy,alsoPlaying:shego,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shego_can_take_photos=shy,As long as you don't mind the inevitable nude leaks...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_will_moan=surprised,Moans? Hoooo boy.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:pauling,targetSaidMarker:miss_pauling_enjoy_the_show=sad,O-okay.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=awkward,And that's a good thing.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:may=beat,Weird. Didn't think there was a breeze in here.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nagisa=surprised,...This is already a little depressing...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,targetSaidMarker:whomstdntve=awkward,I just stick with "who" myself.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:nugi-chan=loss,(C'mon, Pit, don't be a pervert. Take your eyes off Nugi-chan.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:leela=beat,Moving right along...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:gogo=awkward,Did I do that? I mean, I know I'm incredibly handsome, but...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:ayano=awkward,(Just shut up and look elsewhere, Pit.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:monika=devoted,Just like that! ...I think. I've never seen someone do this before tonight, so you really shouldn't ask me for advice.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zelda=shy,S-So you're new to this too? That's reassuring.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:calisto=shy,Wish I could just laugh away the awkwardness of the situation like you. Or should I say <i>Yew</i>?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:florina=stunned,Oh, I'd love to hear this song!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:ann=angry,Hey, I'm not the type who watches. Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I'm no ~player~!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=shy,Time to see an expert at work, I guess.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:lux=happy,Heh. You going like that reminds me of the Lightning Chariot's Lux. Just need Phos, I guess.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amy_rose=joking,I hope that checkpoint was before the game began.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:annie=shy,I'll only look if you want me too, okay?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:yang=surprised,I can't help it! I need to see if you'll get off with a Yang!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kurumu=smug,So, you reveal your true form!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=surprised,You're going right for it? Don't you have to warm up, or something?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:buffy=awkward,Guess you're right, as long as no one here leaks it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aimee=annoyed,Can't stop you, huh? At least try not to fire it..
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:beatrix=smug,Wow, you seem angry. A shame, really.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=stunned,Wait, she's a real girl now?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=pumped,Alright! Plus Super! ...I swear it sounded better in my head.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:blake=embarrassed,Let's just let her do her thing.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyoko=awkward,Give it everything you got, I guess?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va=joking,I hope your APM count is accurate...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misty=happy,Sure. Do it however you want. Fast, slow, I don't really care.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:daria=beat,It never goes away, Daria. Life always finds a way to degrade you, but you get used to it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:ciri=embarrassed,<i>Wow</i>, that was a shift in attitude.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:angie=shy,Well, she lost, so can't really ask for much more.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:chell=beat,Yeah, silent protagonists are annoying.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice=annoyed,Don't look at her... rabbit hole, ~player~. It's rude.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hermione=stunned,Whoa, what? What are those?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:peach=thinking,(Not sure what she's implying... probably better off not knowing)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zizou=shy,So you have to do it too. This game really doesn't make exceptions for anyone.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:evie=shy,Here she goes.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:asuna=stunned,Oh, I just remembered what the game was called.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:moon=embarrassed,Nono... I'm just fine like this, thank you.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:hope=devoted,Don't lose hope, Hope! It's not the end of the world!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:arwen=joking,Well, if you have that much faith, no point in me worrying, is there?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:felicia=awkward,I guess that makes sense. Cats love their toys, after all.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:zoey=shy,I won't. I'd get performance anxiety too.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayla=happy,I do think about it a lot, but never during something like this.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:chara=victory,Guess all that big talk doesn't mean much now, eh Chara?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:d.va_cruiser=joking,How good is your hand-eye coordination?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aiyana=shy,(I shouldn't watch... but she <i>is</i> inviting me... stupid moral conflicts!)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:scarlet_witch=surprised,N-no! No. No? ...Is that how you're supposed to?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:korra=sad,Er, sorry. I'm just sorry.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:faye=beat,Okay, I'll stop. You do your thing.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl=surprised,Sorry, that was rude. Don't turn me into tempura, please.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:corrin_f=thinking,It's hard to imagine, but I guess your whole army <i>is</i> really horny...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=beat,I think you're a little more intoxicated than you think.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sharla=happy,Well okay then!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_v4=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:gwen=embarrassed,Hoo boy... I can see... everything...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elena=sad,I pity the poor girl. No one deserves to do this against their will.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart=thinking,(So this is how an "adnormal" girl does it?)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=surprised,It was a joke! You're not going to hurt us with that, are you?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:april=joking,That doesn't seem very sanitary.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shazza=thinking,Not really that different from humans, are you...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:black_canary=sad,(Man, I feel kinda guilty watching this Ollie's lover like this.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss=shy,M-Maybe you... actually wanted this? No, what am I saying...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mileena=victory,I enjoy the fact that you lost, if nothing else.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:chiaki=beat,So, uh, how much experience do you have with H-games?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:daphne=awkward,'Danger Prone'? You could call any of us that, and it would probably fit.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:lara=shy,It's best not to think about it.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:daisy=surprised,Is that your butthole?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elaine=stunned,(Now, how creative can an adventure game native get?)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=devoted,Don't let it get you down, Mia! I still believe in you!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,<i>She had another one?</i>
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:harley=shy,Sure thing. I'd rather forget tonight too.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:chun-li=shy,I'll just let you get to it, I guess.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:ami=determined,Don't worry! You can trust me to not stare!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:clover=shy,I didn't say something too harsh, did I?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,Is there such thing as a wet nightmare?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:dawn=embarrassed,That's not really necessary, but okay, I guess.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:willow=embarrassed,Yeah... wait, what?!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale=beat,Check-ups are gonna be a lot more awkward after tonight.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=embarrassed,D-Don't rub it in! I'm sensitive about that.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:seven=stunned,You could've fooled me.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:shantae=shy,(Wait, is she really going to dance as she does it?)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:aella=calm,I never learned much either. Angels' code of conduct. Tonight's been great for catching up, though.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:blackrose=shy,How is it? I'm curious.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:chica=sad,You haven't even started, but I feel utterly drained...
-1-female_masturbating,target:ayano,priority:0=beat,Wow, you've got issues.
-1-female_masturbating,target:paya,priority:0=annoyed,(What does Link have that I don't?)
-1-female_masturbating,target:rinkah,priority:0=surprised,Ah! That finger went up her butt!
-1-female_masturbating,target:elena,priority:0=shy,Maybe Elena'll feel better after all this?
-1-female_masturbating,target:futaba,targetNotSaidMarker:seim,alsoPlaying:sei,priority:0=beat,Yeah... I can tell you wanted to be flirty...
-1-female_masturbating,target:mei,targetSaidMarker:mei_nine_year_itch,priority:0=awkward,You were saying you haven't done this in nine years? That's not so bad. Just look at me! Clean for hundreds of year!
-1-female_masturbating,target:velma_classic,priority:0=shy,You've had a lot of crossovers, haven't you?
-1-female_masturbating,target:daisy,priority:0=awkward,(Daisy lacks the grace of Peach, but I guess she has her own charms.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=stunned,Oh! That one looked painful!
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=thinking,So do you get sexual pleasure from wrestling or...?
-1-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0=shy,Did you forget this was supposed to be a different type of forfeit?
-1-female_masturbating,target:blackrose,priority:0=embarrassed,(I can hardly focus with BlackRose moaning like that...)
-1-female_masturbating,target:aiyana,priority:0=awkward,I never knew the Down Under could be this... wet.
-1-female_masturbating,target:raven,targetSaidMarker:getting_off_to_teen_titans,priority:0=surprised,Were those names just then?
-1-female_masturbating,target:sharla,priority:0=thinking,Where's your endurance, Sharla? I'd have thought running around a titan would give you plenty of stamina!
-1-female_masturbating,target:jasmine,priority:0=shy,Guess it's true. She really <i>can</i> show us the world!

-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,priority:0=embarrassed,(I was totally right. I <i>am</i> the one squirming.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:marinette,priority:0=embarrassed,(Bugs usually have six hands to work with, don't they? I wonder if Marinette would like an extra two sets helping... wait, I shouldn't think like that! What would Lady Palutena say?)
-1-female_masturbating,target:tracer,priority:0=shy,So fast...
-1-female_masturbating,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim,priority:0=embarrassed,(Kimmie- I mean Kim- is taking Shego's taunts well. Better than I am, actually.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0=surprised,...
-1-female_masturbating,target:shazza,priority:0=shy,(Is this what they mean by "down under"? Somehow I don't think so.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyoko,priority:0=sad,You sure we can't get her a toy or something? It's like insult to injury to have her use those hands...
-1-female_masturbating,target:elaine,priority:0=surprised,(I've heard my share of rumors, but...)
-1-female_masturbating,target:annie_leonhart,priority:0=shy,(Wow... she's...really digging deep.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:meg,priority:0=stunned,Just... keep on keeping on, Meg.

-1-female_masturbating,target:juri,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=embarrassed,(If there was any doubt before, it's gone now: Juri totally wants Chun-Li.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0=calm,(I think Natsuki's doing fine now. Good for her.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:uhura,alsoPlaying:moon,priority:0=annoyed,You're almost as bad as Moon...
-1-female_masturbating,target:ami,priority:0=stunned,It's not like I'm <i>trying</i> to watch, you know.

-1-female_masturbating,target:penny,priority:0=loss,(I swore I wouldn't look at Penny... but it's tough to keep it up...)
-1-female_masturbating,target:chun-li=calm,So not as bad as you thought?
-1-female_masturbating,target:nagisa,priority:0=awkward,That's one way to get me to see a play!
-1-female_masturbating,target:gwen,targetSaidMarker:dinner,priority:0=thinking,I thought you were taking us to dinner. Is that still happening?
-1-female_masturbating,target:chica,priority:0=beat,(I don't even want to know what those fluids are...)

-1-female_masturbating,target:joey=thinking,Aren't you uncomfortable standing up like that? Pull up a chair or something, I don't mind.
-1-female_masturbating,target:mei,priority:0=beat,So, uh, does anyone know what Mei's saying?
-1-female_masturbating,target:revy,targetSaidMarker:maleplayerfuck,targetNotSaidMarker:maleplayerfinish,priority:0=embarrassed,(So is this what sex is like? I don't know if I could handle that...)
-1-female_masturbating,target:corrin_f,priority:0=embarrassed,(I guess she's getting what she deserves for how she treats Lady Palutena, but I can't help but feel this isn't a punishment for her.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:saki=embarrassed,(Saki...yikes. She could use some help.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:uravity=sad,(It's times like these where I wish I could fly most of all. Humans like Uravity get to act all cool with their flight, and here I am, on the boring old ground.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:daphne,targetSaidMarker:daphne_danger_prone,priority:0=awkward,I see why they call you 'Danger Prone' now.
-1-female_masturbating,target:calisto,priority:0=joking,Calisto's just giggling away over there. She's having a good time.
-1-female_masturbating,target:morrigan,priority:0=thinking,(What I want to know is why this Lilith succubus came here naked.)

-1-female_masturbating,target:ryuko,priority:0=smug,Something something don't lose your way.
-1-female_masturbating,target:beatrix,priority:0=embarrassed,I-I'm not qualified to assist.
-1-female_masturbating,target:sayla,priority:0=awkward,So, what's a good Great Sacred Treasure fact? Sayla sounds like she'd like to hear <i>all about</i> it...
-1-female_masturbating,target:yang,priority:0=embarrassed,(She's really burning up the floor.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:videl,priority:0=annoyed,Show-off.
-1-female_masturbating,target:zone-tan,priority:0=awkward,Meanwhile, this is just a regular day for Zone.
-1-female_masturbating,target:harley,priority:0=awkward,(I'm glad I at least didn't lose to Harley. I'd never hear the end of that from Lady Palutena.)
-1-female_masturbating,target:ann,priority:0=shy,I'm actually enjoying this... don't be mad, Ann. But you really deserve your reputation!
-1-female_masturbating,target:dawn,priority:0=joking,Seeing Dawn masturbate like this...before tonight, I would've called it <i>Farfetch'd</i>.

-1-female_masturbating,target:wiifitfemale,priority:0=stunned,I've always known you were dedicated to your health, but... you're really impressing me.
-1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan,priority:0=thinking,(So when's she actually going to use that thing? She's just holding it there...)
-1-female_masturbating,target:jane,alsoPlaying:daria,priority:0=surprised,If you want to do that, please save it for after the game!
-1-female_masturbating,target:dark_magician_girl,priority:0=shy,Still enjoying this more than the usual "magic shows" I get sent to.
-1-female_masturbating,target:annie,priority:0=stunned,Are you okay, Annie?

female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:live_without_shoes=joking,Don't tempt the fates... they'll hit back hard.
female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:luck_syega=thinking,A "syega"? That sounds... less than pleasant.
female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:need_shoes_back=awkward,They look just like plain old shoes to me...
female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:tada=thinking,Except... you're not?
female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=surprised,Hold on! You're taking off your dress... so soon?
female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=stunned,Does that mean your hair color is <i>fake</i>, Marinette?
female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou=embarrassed,That's not something goddesses are supposed to do! The heck, Zizou?
female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-elizabeth:1=awkward,Really? How many years, you two?
female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=devoted,Maybe it is inevitable, but... maybe there's <i>something</i>?
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=shy,Sounds like it'll be a joyful reunion after the game.
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=joking,Gods? Acting prideful? Surely you jest.
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_is_next=embarrassed,O-Of course not! Not humiliating... at all...
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:dress_off_now=sad,You seemed so nice, I had hoped you wouldn't've had to either.
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:overcoat=shy,I would've counted the overcoat, if it'd make you feel better.
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pay_you_to_keep_dress=sad,I can't take Earth money. Not that I'd want to take it from you to begin with!
female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:paying_you_some_tres=thinking,How much are they compared to hearts?
female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shy,You know, it might've been easier to have removed that before your dress, Sola.
female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zizou=happy,You sew? That's pretty cool.
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4=stunned,What's that thing? It's so cute!
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:zizou=awkward,It really was a good job. Looked almost professional if you ask me!
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dont_tease_me=sad,I'm trying my best to be nice. S-Sorry...
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=beat,I think we all lost our dignity as soon as the first hand was dealt...
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:i_hope_my_family_never_hears_about_this=determined,You won't hear a peep out of me about it! Although I don't actually know your parents...
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:im_actually_doing_this=sad,Can we stop here? Please? We've already had enough humiliation tonight!
female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=devoted,I'll try and keep my words as gentle as possible.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola=victory,You've already gotten this far. You'll do great, Sola!
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=determined,If you can't do it in front of Zizou, try and pretend she's not here.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=shy,I've tried my best to be as friendly as possible... but if that's not enough, I can step out for a minute.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-zizou:1=determined,Who would mock you? You have such a kind demeanor.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:7-8,count-zizou:1=shy,H-Hardly any of us are... <i>I'm</i> not ever going to get used to it...
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:9,count-zizou:1=shy,The forfeit, or whatever Elizabeth's doing with herself?
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,count-zizou:1=joking,I think Elizabeth's family is pretty well-off too, though.
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola=beat,(Poor, poor Sola. I'll try not to stare at her... it's the least I can do.)
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=embarrassed,That's a little <i>too</i> much faith!
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=shy,(Elizabeth's right. Sola has nothing to worry about!)
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:321=embarrassed,What happened to "go"?
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:about_to_see_my_breasts=beat,Well? Say something, ~player~! She's looking right at you!
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:alright_here_i_go=sad,No, I'm not. After all, <i>you</i> don't seem happy.
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:isnt_too_bad=beat,I really hope they don't. For all of our sakes...
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:not_the_best_but=devoted,D-Don't be so negative about them! They're great!
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=shy,Y-You know, that hat might be big enough to cover yourself with...
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=victory,We all believe in you, Sola! This is your moment!
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=beat,There's no way someone like Sola could hex anyone...
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=surprised,Please don't take out your revenge on us... okay?
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-6=shy,I'm as confused as you are. I thought she meant curse, too.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=embarrassed,P-Please, Ladybug! Now's not the time for a proposition like that!
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=surprised,Isn't that coming on a little too strong? That's, like, zero to a hundred right there.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_better=surprised,You don't have to rely on magic to win! I'm sure your luck will turn around!
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:do_or_die=beat,R-Revenge? Magic? That doesn't sound good.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:down_they_go=sad,I think we all lost our dignity long ago.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:get_serious_now=surprised,That sounds pretty serious...
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola,targetSaidMarker:step_it_up=shy,Not to dampen the mood, but wouldn't a spell be cheating, Sola?
female_must_masturbate,target:sola=shy,...Is this the Revenge Magic?
female_start_masturbating,target:sola=surprised,You're glowing! What even <i>is</i> that?
female_start_masturbating,target:sola,alsoPlaying:zizou=beat,It's a shallow reason, though...
female_masturbating,target:sola,priority:0=embarrassed,(I can't believe she put that inside of herself. And what if she can't get it out again?)
female_finished_masturbating,target:sola=awkward,What an explosive finish.
female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=stunned,Say, Jenetta. Those ears... are they real?
female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0=joking,It wouldn't be <i>unfair</i>, just... lond and arduous. That's a word, right?
female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki=awkward,Running an inn doesn't sound fun. And this is coming from someone who runs a platoon.
female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:rinkah=devoted,Either way, you're a bunny girl, right?
female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=shy,Your sister... she's like you? Ears, tail, everything?
female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:chiaki=thinking,No, I think I know you too... vaguely, but still.
female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=thinking,Well, one of you has to lose. I hope I don't have to see who...
female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jin=shy,I... don't think Jin's a hunter, Jenetta. He wouldn't take a shot at your tail.
female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=happy,Hope we can all be friends by the end of tonight!
female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=beat,...You still gotta take 'em off yourself. They won't just walk away.
female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=awkward,That <i>may</i> just be your stockings.
female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:2=shy,This room's warm enough...
female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=joking,Just the sudden temperature change, I think.
female_removing_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:3=annoyed,But you can't stitch time.
female_removed_minor,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=stunned,Oh. Yeah, that makes much more sense. Although if my clothes were ever torn, I could just pull out of the mission.
female_removing_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:4=thinking,(Can she see what she's even doing back there?)
female_removed_major,target:jenetta,targetStage:5=shy,I'm surprised a solitary innkeeper can find time to go to the beach.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:jenetta,marker:puns=joking,Don't you mean no one's ever seen this <i>hare</i> before?
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:jenetta=shy,I think your cheeks will burn a hole in you long before then. But I'll look away.
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jenetta=surprised,No kidding... no time wasted.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:jenetta=embarrassed,M-Maybe it'd help if you covered up a little? You know, with your arms and legs?
female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=joking,I thought everyone knew. I would've told you if you had asked, Jenetta.
female_must_masturbate,target:jenetta=embarrassed,I-I guess not... considering what you've seen here tonight...
female_start_masturbating,target:jenetta=beat,(Glad there's no carrots involved with this.)
female_masturbating,target:jenetta,priority:0=thinking,Looks pretty simple for you... I'm guessing Therian masturbation goes more quickly than humans.
female_finished_masturbating,target:jenetta=surprised,Whoa, you actually said it? I didn't even know you knew that word.
female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=joking,Say Sayori... wow, that's fun to say.
female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=stunned,Crud, totally forgot what I was going to ask.
female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=thinking,Guess it wasn't that important. My question, I mean. Not the blazer.
female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=happy,Does it really matter what it's called? Just call it the "thing that's over your shirt."
female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=beat,I liked my name more.
female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=happy,I almost forgot them myself. And it's way better than having to ditch your shirt.
female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=awkward,Not that it would've been super bad for you. You're so cheery!
female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=beat,No avoiding it this time. But like I said, this shouldn't faze you at all, Sayori.
female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=pumped,That's right! Just stay as positive as you can, and you'll stop caring! (Although I wish I could do the same...)
female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=happy,That's a good idea, take your mind off it! Like... pretend your about to take a dip in the hot springs!
female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=devoted,Don't give us that look! You haven't lost yet, so smile!
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori=determined,Look, Sayori, don't think of this as an unavoidable consequence. See it as... an opportunity.
female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori=shy,See this as a chance to come back from stacked odds for a fantastic victory!
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=sad,Guess my speeches meant nothing at all...
female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori=embarrassed,And now you're naked. Which isn't really helping my case.
female_must_masturbate,target:sayori=beat,Well, uh, Sayori, you might have lost. But! You can't lose again.
female_start_masturbating,target:sayori=victory,I knew you'd be able to make a good situation out of it.
female_masturbating,target:sayori,priority:0=thinking,(She's lightening up again. Getting into a natural rhythm... I think it must certainly help.)
female_finished_masturbating,target:sayori=stunned,Feeling better? I hope so. I like you much more when you're chipper.
female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=devoted,So... is it true? Are you really a battleship?
female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=surprised,Whoa! Is that <i>fire</i>?
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=stunned,That's. So. Cool! I want to see more!
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:Fast1=stunned,S-So fast you didn't even take those off? That's awesome!
female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=thinking,Your shoes are your rudders, huh... You'll still be able to walk and stand, right?
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, good. I was about to call for a chair if you couldn't.
female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=sad,I wonder if this is as close as I'll get to watching a real human naval battle...
female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=thinking,What happened to that little life-preserver thing? Couldn't he help at a time like this?
female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=stunned,(A comm tower? Was someone feeding her info about us this whole time?)
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=awkward,Surprised your hair wasn't singed at all.
female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=beat,So that's seasickness...
female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=awkward,Funny how this seems to know exactly where to hit every time.
female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,targetTimeInStage:0=stunned,Did the round really go that quickly?
female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=shy,That's not very concealing at all... not that I'm an expert in ship design.
female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=shy,Maybe, uh, get better protection? That bra's barely holding you in...
female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=beat,(If I was a few centuries younger, this is where I'd make a poop deck joke.)
female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=shy,Say, Shimakaze, your outfitter has... very interesting tastes in what to have his ship wear.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=beat,It was almost a matter of time, really. If cannon fire didn't do it, physics would've.
female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=determined,Last chance. Don't give up, Shimakaze! Fight like the human race is counting on you!
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=surprised,Okay, little darker than I was expecting.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=joking,Let's just deal the next hand and forget you ever said that, okay? For me?
female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=pumped,Yeah! Critical hit!
female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=awkward,Guess rubbing yourself out is one way to clear those burns. Not an effective way, but a way.
female_masturbating,target:shimakaze,priority:0=thinking,So what does this translate to in boat speak?
female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze=shy,(Well, I think I know why her clothes kept exploding now.)
female_must_masturbate,target:monika,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:8-9,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:affections-glitch=surprised,Uh, Sayori? What's that look in your eye?
female_start_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation=embarrassed,Wait, tying her up? How will she do the forfeit, then?
female_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,priority:0=shy,(Is this what usually happens in "clubs"?)
female_finished_masturbating,target:monika,targetSaidMarker:joint-masturbation,targetNotSaidMarker:joint-masturbation-finished=shy,Hey, uh, Sayori... are you gonna untie her or what?
female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=happy,So hey, that cape twirl at the start you did? <i>Very</i> cool.
female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=beat,Boots aren't that cool... even if they're nearly all that's covering your lower half.
female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=thinking,If you can hover, than why touch the floor at all? If I could fly all the time, that's what <i>I'd</i> do.
female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=smug,You have a dungeon, Zone? What, are you some kind of supervillain or something?
female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=awkward,Too bad there's no such thing as "loss repellant", eh Raven?
female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,totalAlive:5,totalRounds:10-99=joking,There's a lot worse you could've done, Raven. Although I'm slightly glad it's just the one.
female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=awkward,Must be nifty, not having to use your hands all the time.
female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=pumped,Here we go, face reveal!
female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:inventory_vibe2=joking,Hey, I think seeing your real face counts as exciting!
female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=stunned,Oh! You've actually got a really pretty face... but if you don't mind me asking, what's with the jewel?
female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:jura=shy,If I were you, Jura, I wouldn't anger the moody girl with magical powers.
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven=awkward,That opens from the front? Now, what is it?
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=happy,Oh! Let me guess... a weapon?
female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,W-Why don't you wear panties? That's pretty much a perfect set-up for super embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions...
female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetNotSaidMarker:strategic_decision=beat,C-Clearly. Even a thong or something would've been a better option!
female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,What are you talking about? It sounds like there's some bad blood, whatever it is...
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven=shy,I almost might have an easier time with this compared to the leotard... <i>almost</i>.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=thinking,But... you're about to flash her right now? This is confusing...
female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven=beat,M-Maybe not... can you cover up, or something?
female_small_chest_is_visible,target:raven,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=shy,(I'd like to see that fight. I think Raven could pull it off, too.)
female_must_masturbate,target:raven=joking,Guess we'll see how Raven likes to rave!
female_must_masturbate,target:raven,totalMasturbating:1-2=shy,Do I have to? N-Not that I was going to watch you, it's just... I don't know where to look anymore...
female_start_masturbating,target:raven=surprised,You can levitate when you meditate? No fair...
female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0=sad,(I so, so wish I knew how to fly... humans <i>and</i> demons are making me look bad!)
female_masturbating,target:raven,priority:0,targetSaidMarker:getting_off_to_teen_titans=thinking,I feel like I know at least one of those... wish I knew more about hero culture.
female_finished_masturbating,target:raven=surprised,Was that a mini black hole? Or... what was that? It's not gonna have any lasting side effects, right?
male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=thinking,Ryuji? I know a Ryu and I know a Luigi, but first time I've heard of Ryuji.
male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=happy,Oh, yeah, a jacket's a cool way to start. 
male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,count-aggressive:1,totalRounds:0-3=beat,Everyone's chill here, Ryuji. It's just you.
male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=beat,What's that say on your shirt? "Zomg"? Hmm... some sort of monster, maybe?
male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=awkward,(I doubt he'd be able to sneak at all, even with those.)
male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,count-aggressive:1,totalRounds:0-3=awkward,I think you're getting more worked up then the rest of us, Ryuji.
male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=beat,Nothing out of the ordinary yet with you. I expect that to change any time, though.
male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=beat,Socks next... even I saw that coming. Then again, just what I'd expect from a young guy like you.
male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,count-aggressive:1,totalRounds:0-3=joking,Not very lucky today, huh?
male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=awkward,Normally, I'd just chalk that up as overconfidence, but we <i>are</i> indoors.
male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=happy,You know, losing your belt's way more dangerous considering we're playing standing up. Hope those pants are a decent fit, Ryuji.
male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,count-aggressive:1,totalRounds:0-3=surprised,Losing <i>four times in a row</i>? The dealer must have it out for you.
male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4=smug,Out of stalling items? About time.
male_chest_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=annoyed,To be honest, I think "zomg" probably has more flair to it than your abs will...
male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji=beat,Guess it's better than sitting in front of the TV all day. At least, that's what Lady Palutena usually tells me.
male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,totalFemales:2-3=awkward,I've had the exact same thought! Guess great minds think alike?
male_removing_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:5=smug,Removing pants. The natural next step, given... it's... all you can do. Where was I going with this?
male_removed_major,target:ryuji,targetStage:6=happy,Well, whatever. Got you down to your briefs, so not much room for boasting, huh?
male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji=pumped,Alright! There we go!
male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji=surprised,Why are they so swollen? Is that natural? Or is there some sort of medicine for it?
male_must_masturbate,target:ryuji=beat,Good news, Ryuji's out. Bad news, now he's going to be masurbating not that far from me.
male_start_masturbating,target:ryuji=annoyed,Trust me, I'm as thrilled as you are about this. Which is to say, <i>not.</i>
male_masturbating,target:ryuji,priority:0=thinking,(Seriously, why's it so huge? Even both hands around it don't cover the whole thing!)
male_finished_masturbating,target:ryuji=awkward,I'm just gonna pretend I never saw that. 
female_must_strip,target:winter,targetStage:0=beat,I didn't think human officers were so... stiff.
female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0=thinking,So it's a jacket, but it only has half it's arms? Is that even really a jacket at all?
female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:weiss=joking,(How can you say that with a straight face? Schnee is such a funny word.)
female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1=awkward,Not thst it's important now. There's still probably a ways to go with you.
female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,Weiss just <i>now</i> got a victory? Winter doesn't mess around.
female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=beat,Sorry to say this, but Winter totally kicked your butt at this, Weiss.
female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1=thinking,I know it's common for military personnel to use gloves these days, but I still don't see the point of wearing <i>full</i> gloves.
female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=shy,Can we not joke about love lives, please? I'm still looking for someone myself...
female_removing_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=happy,What? Your hands? Don't tell me you wear them at dinner and stuff.
female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2=smug,Well, threats like that aren't very impactful when there's a table separating all of us.
female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=beat,Maybe it'd be better to give her some advice instead of just throwing her in here? Just my two cents.
female_removed_accessory,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=surprised,Wow. Tough love. And this is coming from <i>me</i>!
female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2=smug,Really? Can you say with absolute certainty that you won't take <i>anything</i> else off?
female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-4=stunned,It does? 
female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=joking,I dunno, it probably depends on the area of competition...
female_removing_minor,target:winter,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:weiss=awkward,It's surprising me a little too. But it's all just luck in the end, right?
female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3=angry,Hey, you're still wearing... long... pants? Whatever, it wasn't even a big loss for you.
female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:tina,alsoPlayingStage:3-10=awkward,I might be wrong, but isn't that kind of her specialty?
female_removed_minor,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=pumped,I see. Going all out to protect your little sister is a noble cause, Winter.
female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3=determined,Okay. Time to see what human soldiers pick for their underwear!
female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,This is why I'm glad I don't have a family.
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=surprised,...Strawberries? Those don't seem very practical.
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:1=shy,Why their uncle? Is he in the military with you too?
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ruby,count-yang:0=determined,Hey now, don't punish poor Ruby for something this "Qrow" might find out on his own!
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,I hear seeing this is something semi-common with mortal kids, not two grown adults at a card game...
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:yang,count-ruby:0=awkward,You could say you'll be "eating Qrow" if that happens.
female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4=thinking,So they're connected... wait, does that mean the vest is just for show?
female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:3-4=thinking,I don't think the Dealer's looked into your eyes all night, and <i>especially</i> not now.
female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=beat,The Schnee-sters aren't doing so hot.
female_removing_major,target:winter,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=beat,Weiss is naked, Winter's in her underwear... so much for staying dignified.
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5=stunned,<i>And</i> you match? This... wasn't intentional, right?
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:2=thinking,If I can be honest for a second, neither of you seem terribly toned.
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura=beat,Jura, you're getting under her skin. Might be a bit much, actually.
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingStage:5=angry,You know, when I first saw you, I didn't expect for you to have <i>awful taste</i>!
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=beat,(I could've sworn most human soldiers were asexual. Or was that just a joke Lady Palutena told me?)
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meg,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=smug,Don't you have better things to do besides work out with Winter? Like, say, dodging a rampaging murderous fiend?
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=awkward,(Not surprising these two don't get along. The humans I know aren't the biggest space pirate fans, either.)
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=beat,You Schnees are nothing, if not disciplined.
female_removed_major,target:winter,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:zoey=joking,Sorry, but not me. Maybe I should start paying attention...
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter=determined,Show some backbone, soldier! You're going to be okay!
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:7-10=shy,W-Well, maybe Marinette can take some measurements after the game. I think that's fair enough.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=happy,Looks like the lil' sis managed to hold out longer. Well done, Weiss.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,I-I can't believe I'm seeing two sisters almost completely exposed!
female_large_chest_is_visible,target:winter=surprised,Uh, Winter? I think something else just happened that <i>might</i> be even more embarrassing...
female_large_chest_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Weiss? Are you okay? It must be hard to see your sister look so... pitiful.
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter=beat,Probably for the best. Those are <i>completely</i> soaked through.
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=shy,Are you sure you're really military, Winter? Because you managed to be beaten completely by your younger, completely inexperienced sister.
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=embarrassed,I shouldn't look... not when both sisters are about to go full frontal...
female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter=embarrassed,You shave? Are... soldiers expected to shave down on Earth? Should... should <i>I</i> be shaving?
female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Lady Palutena shaving? Exposing... everything? I don't even want to imagine what that'd be like!
female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=sad,This must be very embarrassing for you, Winter. I'd help if I could, but it's against the rules, I think.
female_crotch_is_visible,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=shy,Not gonna lie, seeing two famous mortal sisters like this makes me feel kind of special.
female_must_masturbate,target:winter=determined,Where's that discipline? You've handled worse. This should be nothing for you!
female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=surprised,And now you have to masturbate in front of your kid sister? Ouch...
female_must_masturbate,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=shy,Guess both Schnees had some really bad luck this time around.
female_start_masturbating,target:winter=beat,(Man, I really need to start taking my own advice.)
female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=joking,T-Try not to look at her, Weiss! You can look at me, if it helps?
female_start_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=shy,This is the most extreme family bonding exercise I've ever seen.
female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0=annoyed,This feels like it's taking a while. Not that I mind six more weeks of Winter, but... y'know.
female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=surprised,So! Hey! Weiss! What's something I can do to get your mind off Winter?
female_masturbating,target:winter,priority:0,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=embarrassed,I still can't believe they'd make you two do this nearly back-to-back...
female_finished_masturbating,target:winter=shy,You kinda rambled for a bit there...
female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=surprised,Stay with us, Weiss! Need something? I'll go get it!
female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:7=shy,Winter came... just a matter of time before the winter blossom follows suit.
female_finished_masturbating,target:winter,alsoPlaying:weiss,alsoPlayingStage:8=beat,I'm not proud either. I would've wanted to be at any other poker table, honestly. Sorry to both of you.

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:sola=stripping,You think so? I've had them for over three decades, you know.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sola=stripped,Is trading outfits a common thing? To be honest, I'm not sure I could with a girl. Especially since you wear a dress!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sola=stripping,<i>Super</i> humiliated, Sola.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sola=stripped,I appreciate the thought, but it wouldn't do me much good to run and hide. Not very fitting for an elite soldier.

female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=awkward,Do all goddesses wear circlets? Is it just, like, an unwritten rule?
female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=shy,You really didn't have to, Nayru! I wouldn't have minded the extra round!
female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sayori,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:filter-fancy=shy,I guess all servants of the goddesses are hard workers, huh? I just wish I didn't end up in such a weird place...

female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4=angry,Pandora! Why are you here?
female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,It's a lovely gown. And I hardly ever use words like lovely, so you know it's true!

female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,Right. Let's keep this between us as servants of the gods, okay Nayru?
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=surprised,Hold on... was this a set up? Did Nayru betray us?
female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=beat,<i>Major</i> understatement right there.

female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=joking,You did your best. I'm sorry you didn't win, but we were both new to this.
female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=sad,So it really was your plan, wasn't it...
female_start_masturbating,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=shy,Well, that only makes sense. You don't have time for that. I'm the same way.
female_masturbating,target:nayru,priority:0=joking,Hey, maybe some music would lighten things up? How about a song, Nayru?
female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru=devoted,You did really good for a first-timer! I think.
female_finished_masturbating,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=beat,Should we go hunt down Pandora? She got away...
female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=shy,Something about Alice really throws me off. And it's not just the near lack of clothing.
female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=thinking,(Okay, so she's not human. That's probably a bad start.)
female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=beat,Good job, ~player~. You got caught.
female_removing_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:1=beat,Makes sense. It's basically the only modest thing <i>left</i> on you.
female_removed_minor,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:2=joking,How does that make any sense? Unless you're a plant woman.
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=surprised,A-Already? Not that they were super hidden to begin with, but...
female_large_chest_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=sad,I seriously can't help feeling that something's very wrong here.
female_removing_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:3=shy,That <i>is</i> a very good question. So...?
female_removed_major,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:4=beat,That's not even underwear! It's like... string.
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:alice_mgq=surprised,So... hey! Interesting tattoo... 
female_crotch_is_visible,target:alice_mgq=shy,(Changing the subject didn't work... hopefully a new round will.)
female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=embarrassed,So there <i>was</i> something off about Alice!

female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=happy,Glad things didn't get violent, at least. As much as I'd love to fight you properly, I'm unequipped at the moment.

female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=determined,That's right! And I'm coming for the rest, too!
female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=thinking,(I could use a drink myself after this...)

male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=surprised,What's that purple thing?
male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=stunned,Was that a power? Super speed, maybe?
male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=angry,T-There it is again!
male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking,(Is he stopping time? At the very least, he doesn't seem to be cheating with it...)
male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=awkward,That hat blends in <i>incredibly</i> well with your hair.

female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0=surprised,Whoa! That's kind of strong for a first item, don'tcha think?
female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=shy,Do all Equestrian girls have a blatant disregard for clothes?
female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=surprised,That's really strong, too!
female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=shy,I think this has already gone far! More than I was ready for...
female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=awkward,Please, go ahead. I know all too well how heavy shoes can feel.
female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,marker:pinka,notSaidMarker:pinka=surprised,Huh? What happened? She seems... different now. And more dangerous...
female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:surprise_strip=beat,That's, uh, the opposite of a surprise in this game, Pinkie.
female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=surprised,That's... ominous. Especially from someone like you.
female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start=sad,I think our definitions of fun aren't the same, new Pinkie...
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pinkie_pie=embarrassed,W-Why did you do that? They're basically the same... 
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start=determined,Everyone, behind me! I'll fight her off!

female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pinkie_pie,priority:0=embarrassed,P-Please don't do that! If you're trying to make fun of me, it's not working!

female_chest_will_be_visible,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2,marker:pinka,notSaidMarker:pinka=surprised,Huh? What happened? She seems... different now?

female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:pinkie_pie,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=beat,I'm just going to try and forget that now. Murderous split personalities aren't exactly my forte.
female_must_masturbate,target:pinkie_pie=thinking,Is there something I don't get about hair like that? Why up there?
female_start_masturbating,target:pinkie_pie=shy,A-As much as I love balloons, this doesn't seem very safe...
female_masturbating,target:pinkie_pie,priority:0=beat,That'll totally break. Watch.
female_finished_masturbating,target:pinkie_pie=awkward,Called it. There's no way it would stay together after all that...
female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=happy,So, Ping, what sort of land do you come from?
female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=joking,Well, that just makes sense.
female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:1=pumped,Alright! Another win on Ping!
female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1=thinking,There was a ploy?
female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy=happy,It's true. You're not a big villain  compared to what I've fought, either.
female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2=surprised,You were a woman? S-Sorry, I hope I didn't offend you at all...
female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3=surprised,Early morning bathing? That's cruel and unusual! Don't you have any hot springs?
female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:shoes_indoors=thinking,Is that really how princesses work? No wonder I see them everywhere...
female_removing_minor,target:mulan,targetStage:3=pumped,See? Mulan gets it!
female_removed_minor,target:mulan,targetStage:4=joking,Anyone who enjoys a pun like that is okay in my book.
female_removing_minor,target:mulan,targetStage:4=beat,Oh. Maybe take a look at that vest?

female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=awkward,Right. Take care of yourself, Haru.

female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=happy,After you, Haru.
female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=awkward,It doesn't really mean much with a skirt like that, huh?
female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=stunned,Is that a woolen sweater? (She reminds me a lot of sheep. I don't know why...)
female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3=devoted,A present like that... it sounds wonderful, doesn't it?
female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=beat,Getting to the tough choices now...
female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=shy,Either way would've been pretty rough, Haru. I think this was smarter.
female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ryuji=beat,It's a lot more awkward when you know each other, though...
female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=determined,Let's get to it, then.

female_must_strip,target:lotte,targetStage:0=thinking,So is it pronounced like "lot" or "latte"? I wasn't sure.
female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-akko:0=stunned,Akko? She sounds interesting...
female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko=beat,Akko, what did you do...?
female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=joking,Oh, no, it's totally fine! I'd use a weapon or two as layers if I brought them, after all!
female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=awkward,That's too bad. Hairbands are super useful...
female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=beat,Not as messy as mine, that's for sure.
female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=shy,W-Well, I think it's really brave that you're sticking to your word, Lotte!
female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,count-akko:1=shy,Akko <i>does</i> seem like she would do that...
female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=awkward,Yeah, it's a little fun, huh?
female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,count-akko:1=awkward,Yeah, it's a little fun, huh? (I never expected Akko to be so aggressive with this stuff...)
female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=devoted,You've got this, Lotte.
female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=shy,That still doesn't mean I should look, though...
female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=thinking,Fanfic? What's that?
female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=awkward,That'd be nice. (Seeing as I can't read it myself...)
female_chest_will_be_visible,target:lotte=shy,Do you... want me to look away? I can try and make this easier.
female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte=sad,Oh... I'm sorry. I think they're pretty nice as they are! And, well, I'm sure they'll develop soon!
female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:lotte=surprised,I-I don't want to hear what comes next...

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:link,alsoPlayingStage:8,saidMarker:playerf,priority:0=masturbate_c,How's it feel, ~player~? Not everyday you have two Nintendo studs masturbating for you...
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:8,priority:0=masturbate_a,Boner squad? Is this what it's like to fit in with humans? Feels nice... and almost offsets the awkwardness of this...

-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_a,I hope I'm good enough for you...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_b,Angels don't do this sort of thing...
-2-heavy_masturbating=heavy_c,I'm getting a weird feeling... am I close?
-2-heavy_masturbating,alsoPlaying:gwen,priority:0=heavy_b,I'm feeling really good... is this because of Gwen's cheat code?
-2-finishing_masturbating=finishing,I'M FINISHED!

-1-finished_masturbating=beat,What a feeling that was. Gonna need to cool down a bit... lower the intensity level...
-1-finished_masturbating=finished,So when do I get to put my clothes back on? I'm starting to get cold.

-1-finished_masturbating=happy,I was expecting this to be way worse than it turned out being. Guess Lady Palutena had the right idea after all!
-1-finished_masturbating=happy,It feels nice to socialize with the average and not-so-average humans for once. I practically feel like one of you!
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:juri,notSaidMarker:finished,marker:finished=finished,Yeah... who could've seen this coming? Not me. Hehehe...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:morrigan,priority:0=embarrassed,Say, y-you weren't really serious about before, were you Morrigan? It was just a trick, right?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:morrigan,priority:0=shy,(H-How should I deal with this Morrigan situation? She's a servant of evil, but somehow one of the nicest ones to me here. I'm stuck...)

-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:30=annoyed,Can you pick up the pace? As fun as that was, I still don't like being all exposed like this.

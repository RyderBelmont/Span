#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-,This is what the character says after they've been selected if the new triggers aren't used


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).
clothes=Shirt,shirt,major,upper
clothes=Bra,bra,important,upper
clothes=Shorts,shorts,major,lower,plural
clothes=Panties,panties,important,lower,plural
clothes=Gloves,gloves,minor,upper,plural
clothes=Socks,socks,minor,lower,plural



#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=tap,I'll exchange ~cards~ cards.
swap_cards=tap,~cards~!
swap_cards=tap,Hm...
swap_cards=tap,Eh...
swap_cards=tap,Let's see...
swap_cards=tap,Oh, how obvious.
swap_cards=tap,So simple.
good_hand=smug,Oh, this is a nice hand.
good_hand=cheer,It’s kind of mean, but I wish I were playing a game with an audience. They’d be happy to see this hand and Ai-chan Win!
good_hand=confident,Ehehe~ if any of you were real people, you’d be in for a surprise.
good_hand=sprightly,Yes! I am unstoppable!
good_hand=smug,I’ll make this hand work. I won’t have to work very hard.
good_hand=stretch,I’m about to win!
good_hand=prattle,Oh… Eh!? Oh. Ehe?! Yep, a good hand!
good_hand=exposit,I’m not really very good at cards… but I am very smart. So this is a good hand.
good_hand=serious,Let’s… see.. how… this goes!
good_hand=pleased,Okay… wait, no, this is a good hand. Ehehe. I can bluff.
okay_hand=exposit,Normally, I like to stream my games, but a superintelligent AI has to have her private time too.
okay_hand=exult,Lots of people try to flirt with me on my channel, and it’s nice, sometimes. But it’s nicer to have alone time, I think.
okay_hand=smug,This is a practice run for some stuff for my channel! I know Youtube won’t let me upload adult stuff, but I was considering other options.
okay_hand=ohnoes,I guess if this goes badly, I <i>could</i> be a virtual Porntuber…
okay_hand=peeved,Is ~player~ supposed to be like a test model for characters to react to? ~player~ doesn’t have tags, or anything…
okay_hand=peeved,Okay, so we have a few different characters here. But where’s ~player~ from?
okay_hand=discomfort,A.I. games is my streaming channel! How do I ad-ver-tise that though? I’m the one playing this after all.
okay_hand=smart,~player~, you don’t have a lot of dialogue do you?
okay_hand=peeved,Hmm… well, this hand is fine, but… ~player~, what’s up with you? You don’t really talk. And you--have--variable "clothes"?! Eh!?
okay_hand=pleased,I don’t think it’s weird to talk to myself. If I can talk to myself, I’m always in good com-pan-y!
okay_hand=confident,I’m a super advanced AI! So I’ll try and say something new and specific about every character I beat in this game.
okay_hand=confident,Even something like ~player~, who doesn’t seem to have a lot of details besides a few clothing options should have things I can react to!
okay_hand=cheer,Moshi moshi, this is good practice for games I can’t always stream live! Even if I talk to myself a little, it should be fun!
okay_hand=tap,Hmm… Clearly this hand is decent.
okay_hand=nonplussed,Oh, so it’s a pair. That’s fine, right?
okay_hand=sprightly,Aww, what’ve we got--- an okay hand!
okay_hand=nonplussed,Hmm… it’s a lot better than a blank white room, but I’m still not sure what to make of this.
okay_hand=discomfort,I’ve got a feeling I’m going to… prob-ab-ly not lose this hand?
bad_hand=shock,Eh? <i>Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?</i>
bad_hand=discomfort,Nani?
bad_hand=rage,I guess if you can’t lose, you can’t enjoy it, really.
bad_hand=tap,Eh? Retry. Um… I’m clicking… … There is no retry here, is there?
bad_hand=smug,Eh. I lost the hand, but I prob-ab-ly don’t even have anything to show if I do lose…
bad_hand=prattle,I’ve seen people use my model in dirty videos. I think I may be enacting some of those scenarios...
bad_hand=install,Hum… I can’t really see a way I win this hand. Reset! Eh!? Reset! Resetresetreset!
bad_hand=askance,I’m glad this isn’t being broadcasted. I’m very good at following rules.
bad_hand=discomfort,Oh. I see. I’m screwed.
bad_hand=ohnoes,Phew. It’s a good thing I didn’t put this on Youtube. I’d be banned for the nudity stuff but also it wouldn’t help me migrate platforms…

3-stripped=aaStripped,Look, see, no pan-- no panties-- huh. I'm wearing panties I guess. I definitely knew that.
3-stripped=aaStripped,Eh? <i>Eh?</i> I wouldn’t--didn't mean to match my underwear. I knew I had it. Maybe I just wore them for this game? Ufufu~
3-must_strip_winning=domo,Hum… Well, my shorts are off. I guess I have nothing to lose by taking off my panties!

3-stripping=xxRemovePanties,I wonder if I even have anything down there. Maybe I'm a boy. Maybe it's just smooth, like a plate.


#losing gloves
4-stripped=aaStripped,Oh! I do have one of those~ of course I do. Why would someone go to the trouble of building me a cute body without all the cute parts?
4-stripped=aaStripped,Oh. It is smooth. Just not <i>flat</i>. It’s important for my hologram clothing to render that it’s smooth like that.
4-must_strip_winning=cheer,I’m doing really well, so I guess now~ ehehe. Now, the gloves can come off.
4-must_strip_winning=rage,I’ve been holding back my true power~! Time for the gloves--TO--COME--OFF!~

4-stripping=xxRemoveGloves,Well, here-- I-- go--!
4-stripping=xxRemoveGloves,I’m not very good at motion capture, so this is the very absolute first time I’ve done this--!


#losing socks
5-stripped=aaStripped,Okay, that was my last loss. It’s not like I have anything left to show.
5-stripped=aaStripped,Prepare to lose, computer controlled sexy people!
5-must_strip_winning=smart,Well, it makes sense that I get naked. I’m learning so much about my model today!
5-must_strip_winning=smug,Ufufu~ a victory that’s easy isn’t worth doing. If I wanted to win, I’d just turn on debug mode and see all the cute boys and girls naked.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2=rage,Eh? <i>Eh</i>? Twice in a row? This is cheating! Nonsense! A scam! I demand a retry! This is bugged!

5-must_strip_normal=askance,Eh? Okay… it’s nice to take these off too. I worry I’ll drip onto them. I didn’t even know I could do that?
5-must_strip_normal=shock,Okay, okay. I’ll admit, it’s nice to touch a floor that’s not just my white room. I don’t know who I’m admitting that too, though.

5-stripping=xxRemoveSocks,I kind of want to just tear these off, but I think they’re not designed to come off like that…
5-stripping=xxRemoveSocks,Eh? If I’m going to take these off, maybe I should rip them in half…? But would I be able to remodel them? Hm…

-3-stripped=aaStripped,Eh? I’m surprised I have toes. I can understand having boobs and a crotch, but… toes? Who likes those?
-3-stripped=aaStripped,Well, now you can see my little toes. Eh? I’m surprised those got modeled in. The pussy and titties I can understand, but toes? Who does that?




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-male_human_must_strip,saidMarker:human_6,notSaidMarker:human_7,marker:human_7=smug,No more surprises from ~player~, ufufu~.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=pleased,Oh! ~name~’s getting started.

0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0=cheer,Eh? I won already?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:7-8=nonplussed,Hum. ~name~ has more left?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:7-8=smug,~name~ lost that many when I still had so much left? As expected of a super powerful AI.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:7-8=smug,Almost a perfect victory. Not that I expected differently.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=prattle,Oh… is ~name~ going to surprise me now?

0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,So handsome and kind! Steve Rogers is a good choice, if you can find him for your games!
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=prattle,Hm. He looks very small, but very confident. I suppose some people like beating up wise goodboys like that? Kind of sa-dis-tic.
0-male_must_strip,target:lotor,targetStage:0=smart,Hm… You’re kind of a conflicted character, aren’t you, Mr. Purple? I bet you’re a lot of people’s guilty pleasure.

0-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=exposit,She looks like a cupcake. I bet she’d be really mad if I called her cupcake in person though. She lived in her game, though, which is nice.
0-female_must_strip,target:diana,targetStage:0=sprightly,Aww, don’t worry. I’m sure your friend Akko will be ready soon, Ms. Cavendish!
0-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=sprightly,Oh! Ghost Spider. It’s hard to keep up with how many superhero names Americans have. I think she might be good at music. Our colors match too.
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=discomfort,Hm. Is she hiding a penis? Her name is Futa-ba, after all. I guess some people like girls with challenges.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, so dark and mysterious, but so relatable. I think if she were real, Raven would be a good friend of mine.
0-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Eh? That’s clearly a girl.
0-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smug,Hm… this is a girl pretending to be a boy, right? It seems a little impatient to try that without the code supporting it.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Oh! She’s got a lot of fanart with me. Very cute, nice girl. Likes art class a lot. Her friend’s butthole is always very weird though.
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Oh wow! Girls can remove their clothes in this game in any order, can't they? Very sexy.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=smart,Hm. She’s a blue-haired bar girl, right? Like Eve 6, right? I suppose some people like party girls.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=shock,Oh! I bet she’s for people who like big strong women. Whoever those are.

0-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=discomfort,Oh… she’s from that dirty hentai, isn’t she? I like that one.
0-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=serious,What a sweetheart. I can’t tell if I should feel bad about beating her, or if that’s the appeal of a game like this.
0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,Ohhh. She’s a sexy woman! Very good legs and boobs. And a sword. I think people like their women with swords here.
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=exposit,She’s not an AI, but she’s supposed to be one of the best companions in video games, right? I think she’s a good choice for this game, then.
0-female_must_strip,target:ritz,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Her hair is so pretty! I wonder if she’s got snowy white hair after her personality melts. Because it’s like snow.

2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=discomfort,So ~name~ can...
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=nonplussed,I didn’t know I had boobs modeled for this.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=serious,Hm. I guess my boobs are out, so ~name~ might take off more?
2-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=shock,Oh! I bet she’s for people who like big strong women. Whoever those are.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia=confident,Don’t worry, Amalia, I have a lot more to say to you soon!

2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=pleased,She’s a cute artist. Or is she just a character by an artist? She reminds me of Ai-chan a lot. With more tentacles.

2-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smug,Hm… this is a girl pretending to be a boy, right? It seems a little impatient to try that without the code supporting it.

2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Oh! She’s got a lot of fanart with me. Very cute, nice girl. Likes art class a lot. Her friend’s butthole is always very weird though.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=nonplussed,La-dy-bug.  She seems very awkward. But she’s only wearing three pieces, right? Shouldn’t be hard to beat.
2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=nonplussed,La-dy-bug.  She seems very awkward and sweet. I wonder what kind of boys like girls like that.

2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=pleased,Wait a minute… wasn’t she supposed to be tang? I guess this girl is a slime girl. I don’t see others like her.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=askance,~name~ can see my boobs, so this better be worth it.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=exposit,Okay… ~name~ is taking off…

3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=exposit,She looks like a cupcake. I bet she’d be really mad if I called her cupcake in person though. She lived in her game, though, which is nice.
3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=sprightly,Oh! Ghost Spider. It’s hard to keep up with how many superhero names Americans have. I think she might be good at music. Our colors match too.

3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=exposit,She’s not an AI, but she’s supposed to be one of the best companions in video games, right? I think she’s a good choice for this game, then.
3-female_must_strip,target:ritz,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Her hair is so pretty! I wonder if she’s got snowy white hair after her personality melts. Because it’s like snow.

3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=askance,I always was a little grossed out by a young, sexualized girl in a mech, but I think D.Va is a good way of embracing and refuting stereotypes. <i>Eh?</i> Did someone put words in my mouth?
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=tap,Hm... isn't her game a mobile game? I bet I could poke her a lot. So cute.

4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=askance,Oh. Gunfire girl is stripping again. I guess everyone’s going to get scared.
4-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-5=exult,Oh. Aimee is shooting off her clothes. I like that about her, very interesting.
4-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:0=rage,Eh? <i>Eh?</i> EH-EH-EH-EH? This is an offensive stereotype. Real AI’s aren’t like this! I’m going to destroy her!
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:7-8=cheer,Ohh, ~name~’s going to be on display for me now, isn’t ~name~?
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:7-8=sprightly,Ehehe. I’m excited for this.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:7-8=smug,Well, this is what you get when you see me naked, I suppose.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=pleased,Wait a minute… wasn’t she supposed to be tang? I guess this girl is a slime girl. I don’t see others like her.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,I’m really liking this. I don’t like tense things normally, but this is fun!
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=smug,~name~’s close! To losing.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=prattle,Oooh. Okay. So ~name~’s done now, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:felicia=peeved,Does… she have clothing to remove?
4-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confident,This is a girl that plays games! That means she's worth protecting! And getting absolutely naked!
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Oh! She’s got a lot of fanart with me. Very cute, nice girl. Likes art class a lot. Her friend’s butthole is always very weird though.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=shock,You can see almost all of me, ~name~, so you really should make this good… Eh? Who am I talking to. You’re just a character, ~name~-chan.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=confident,It’s rude to take off small stuff when an AI’s naked in front of you. Make it matter.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0=askance,Eh? This is ~name~’s first loss? But, you can see titties and puss-y! I didn’t even know those were real!
4-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=exposit,She looks like a cupcake. I bet she’d be really mad if I called her cupcake in person though. She lived in her game, though, which is nice.
4-female_must_strip,target:coco,targetStage:0=smug,Oh. She's the cool, dom-i-na-trix type? Ai-chan understands that.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,Ohhh. She’s a sexy woman! Very good legs and boobs. And a sword. I think people like their women with swords here.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia=confident,Don’t worry, Amalia, I have a lot more to say to you soon!
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Oh wow! She has so much to say!
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=pleased,She’s a cute artist. Or is she just a character by an artist? She reminds me of Ai-chan a lot. With more tentacles.
4-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=smug,Oh! She’s got a ghost in her. Is it like that old movie, where she’s in love with the ghost? Or the one with John McClane?
4-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=askance,I always was a little grossed out by a young, sexualized girl in a mech, but I think D.Va is a good way of embracing and refuting stereotypes. <i>Eh?</i> Did someone put words in my mouth?

5-male_human_must_strip,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_4=pleased,It’s actually nice playing this with someone else. You can’t really see your character, ~player~, but I think he’s cute.

5-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=askance,What kind of game is this? I got modeled, and I’m showing off everything, and you’re barely losing anything!
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=smart,Oh, I get it. I'm winning in some other way. Of course. Of course.
5-male_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=prattle,Hm… Okay, I guess ~name~ isn’t that much far ahead.
5-male_must_strip,target:9s,targetStage:0=prattle,Hm. He looks very small, but very confident. I suppose some people like beating up wise goodboys like that? Kind of sa-dis-tic.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Wow! He has a lot to say to people. Pit, are you an AI too? It’s nice to meet you!

5-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smug,Hm… this is a girl pretending to be a boy, right? It seems a little impatient to try that without the code supporting it.
5-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=smug,Oh! She’s got a ghost in her. Is it like that old movie, where she’s in love with the ghost? Or the one with John McClane?

5-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confident,This is a girl that plays games! That means she's worth protecting! And getting absolutely naked!
5-female_must_strip,target:felicia=peeved,Does… she have clothing to remove?
5-female_must_strip,target:akko,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Ohhh… she’s from that Trigger studio. But she’s not as popular as the scissor girls or the sniper girl, right? That’s why it took so long for her to come out.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:4-6=confident,I’m really liking this. I don’t like tense things normally, but this is fun!

5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=domo,Mahiru seems like a good girlfriend. She doesn’t use social media for posting her pictures, but she likes making memories. And probably taking naked pictures.
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smug,Oh, so dark and mysterious, but so relatable. I think if she were real, Raven would be a good friend of mine.
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=smart,Hm. She’s a blue-haired bar girl, right? Like Eve 6, right? I suppose some people like party girls.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=pleased,Ohhh. She’s a sexy woman! Very good legs and boobs. And a sword. I think people like their women with swords here.
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=tap,Hm... isn't her game a mobile game? I bet I could poke her a lot. So cute.
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=discomfort,Hm. Is she hiding a penis? Her name is Futa-ba, after all. I guess some people like girls with challenges.
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=exposit,Is she pink because she’s supposed to look like a giant pussy? Her wings look like labia. I don’t know why I know this, but I do.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=sprightly,I get the mommy vibe from this character. I bet she’d take good care of Ai-chan.
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Oh wow! Girls can remove their clothes in this game in any order, can't they? Very sexy.
5-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=exposit,She’s not an AI, but she’s supposed to be one of the best companions in video games, right? I think she’s a good choice for this game, then.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=nonplussed,La-dy-bug.  She seems very awkward. But she’s only wearing three pieces, right? Shouldn’t be hard to beat.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=nonplussed,La-dy-bug.  She seems very awkward and sweet. I wonder what kind of boys like girls like that.
5-female_must_strip,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=cheer,Shiiiiiiii~ning~~ Just~~ice~~ start~ing to bloom~ I like her music a lot!
5-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:0=discomfort,Oh… she’s from that dirty hentai, isn’t she? I like that one.
5-female_must_strip,target:ritz,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Her hair is so pretty! I wonder if she’s got snowy white hair after her personality melts. Because it’s like snow.
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=confident,Don’t worry, Nugi-chan, I have more lines for you soon!
5-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=sprightly,Oh! Ghost Spider. It’s hard to keep up with how many superhero names Americans have. I think she might be good at music. Our colors match too.
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=shock,Oh! I bet she’s for people who like big strong women. Whoever those are.

-3-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Eh? That’s clearly a girl.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smug,Hm… this is a girl pretending to be a boy, right? It seems a little impatient to try that without the code supporting it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:0=askance,I always was a little grossed out by a young, sexualized girl in a mech, but I think D.Va is a good way of embracing and refuting stereotypes. <i>Eh?</i> Did someone put words in my mouth?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=serious,What a sweetheart. I can’t tell if I should feel bad about beating her, or if that’s the appeal of a game like this.
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=discomfort,Hm. Is she hiding a penis? Her name is Futa-ba, after all. I guess some people like girls with challenges.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=nonplussed,Oh! She’s got a lot of fanart with me. Very cute, nice girl. Likes art class a lot. Her friend’s butthole is always very weird though.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=pleased,Wait a minute… wasn’t she supposed to be tang? I guess this girl is a slime girl. I don’t see others like her.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=smug,Oh! She’s got a ghost in her. Is it like that old movie, where she’s in love with the ghost? Or the one with John McClane?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia=confident,Don’t worry, Amalia, I have a lot more to say to you soon!
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=exposit,She looks like a cupcake. I bet she’d be really mad if I called her cupcake in person though. She lived in her game, though, which is nice.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=sprightly,I get the mommy vibe from this character. I bet she’d take good care of Ai-chan.
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Oh wow! She has so much to say!
-3-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=sprightly,Oh! Ghost Spider. It’s hard to keep up with how many superhero names Americans have. I think she might be good at music. Our colors match too.
-3-female_must_strip,target:diana,targetStage:0=sprightly,Aww, don’t worry. I’m sure your friend Akko will be ready soon, Ms. Cavendish!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=smart,Hm. She’s a blue-haired bar girl, right? Like Eve 6, right? I suppose some people like party girls.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=confident,Don’t worry, Nugi-chan, I have more lines for you soon!

-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=rage,Eh!? Eh!? I… I rendered everything! This is a trick! Mean game! Bad!
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=askance,But I… you saw me…
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:1-3=askance,Eh? You… are barely starting to get naked. That’s… unreasonable!
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=nonplussed,La-dy-bug.  She seems very awkward. But she’s only wearing three pieces, right? Shouldn’t be hard to beat.
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=nonplussed,La-dy-bug.  She seems very awkward and sweet. I wonder what kind of boys like girls like that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=pleased,She’s a cute artist. Or is she just a character by an artist? She reminds me of Ai-chan a lot. With more tentacles.

-1-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=pleased,So handsome and kind! Steve Rogers is a good choice, if you can find him for your games!
-1-male_must_strip,target:lotor,targetStage:0=smart,Hm… You’re kind of a conflicted character, aren’t you, Mr. Purple? I bet you’re a lot of people’s guilty pleasure.

-1-female_must_strip,target:akko,targetStage:0=ohnoes,Ohhh… she’s from that Trigger studio. But she’s not as popular as the scissor girls or the sniper girl, right? That’s why it took so long for her to come out.

-1-female_must_strip,target:gwen,targetStage:0=sprightly,Oh! Ghost Spider. It’s hard to keep up with how many superhero names Americans have. I think she might be good at music. Our colors match too.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_accessory=prattle,Eh? There’s more accessories, ~name~?
male_removing_accessory=rage,Sheesh, you still have accessories left?
male_removed_accessory=stretch,Whew. I’m tired of talking about ~name~ and his accessories…
male_removed_accessory=stretch,Wow, I really talked a lot today. I’m out of specific stuff to say.
female_removing_accessory=shock,Eh? There’s more accessories, ~name~?
female_removing_accessory=peeved,Sheesh, you still have accessories left?
female_removed_accessory=discomfort,Whew. I’m tired of talking about ~name~ and her accessories…

0-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.

0-male_removing_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!

0-male_removing_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…

0-male_removing_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
0-male_removing_accessory,filter:english,notSaidMarker:english_2,marker:english_2=glasses,~Name~ is so sunshiney for being so calm. He seems to carry on well.
0-male_removing_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_1,marker:thong_1=peeved,“I’m not supposed to talk about ~name~’s underwear until I can see it…” But it’s a thong, that seems more interesting than his ~clothing~... oops.
0-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!

1-female_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=prattle,Hum. Her hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean she’s disorganized? I think a girl should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off her ~clothing~.

1-female_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_1,marker:rwby_1=peeved,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad she didn’t bring it to the game!

1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for her.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=stretch,Hum… she’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ she’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?
1-female_removed_accessory,filter:ginger,notSaidMarker:ginger_1,marker:ginger_1=serious,The redheads in these games are always sultry. I think if I were going to kiss one of them, ~name~ would be the one I want.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:gun,notSaidMarker:gun_2,marker:gun_2=nonplussed,Can I ask ~name~ for his gun? I know we don’t get to put clothes back on. But while he takes off his ~clothing~, I think I would look very cool.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_2,marker:ponytail_2=install,If my hair were like that, I’d be a cobra. You would look at it, then I’d have undressed! Also then fang. Rawr! Kizuna-AIttack!

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:italian,notSaidMarker:italian_2,marker:italian_2=pleased,Italians use a lot of noodles… are Italians just Japanese Europeans? I can see myself wearing ~clothing~ and everything!
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:exotic_hair,notSaidMarker:exotic_hair_2,marker:exotic_hair_2=glasses,Ex-o-tic hair. Oh, so he’s like me. Very relatable. Even if he’s not an AI, I think I’d have ~clothing~ like ~name~’s.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_2,marker:short_hair_2=sprightly,Maybe long hair is better since you can do more stuff with it to look cool, ~name~.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:dark_eyes,notSaidMarker:dark_eyes_2,marker:dark_eyes_2=serious,Creepy. But cute. I like cute but creepy things. Like kittens. Or ~clothing~.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=nonplussed,Oh. He's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into his. Lots of skincare.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_1,marker:blue_eyes_1=rage,Take that, blue eyes ~name~! That’s how I remember names. As a superintelligent AI, I have to remember somehow. It’s no fun if I just give out the answer in 0.1 seconds.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_2,marker:black_hair_2=smart,Very few 3D boys dye their hair to look like mine. I think if I weren’t an AI, mine would look like ~name~’s, right?

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_2,marker:scottish_2=ohnoes,I can’t drink, so I’m not sure what the appeal of Scotland is. Maybe it’s true that ~name~ came here to get away? I don’t know. He's not real. His ~clothing~ maybe…?

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_1,marker:thong_1=peeved,“I’m not supposed to talk about ~name~’s underwear until I can see it…” But it’s a thong, that seems more interesting than his ~clothing~... oops.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:american,notSaidMarker:american_1,marker:american_1=glasses,Oh, say can you see~ ~name~’s ~clothing~-- Gack. English is hard to do.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:german,notSaidMarker:german_2,marker:german_2=sprightly,Beep beep boop boop. That’s not Ai-chan talking, that’s what ~name~’s brain sounds like.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_2,marker:mixed_heritage_2=nonplussed,It seems like ~name~ has a complex life, being from two cultures. I’m glad I’m just digital. This makes all culture my culture. Even this game is part of my virtual culture.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_2,marker:australian_2=pleased,Australian people sound like they’re always having a good time. It makes it easy to make ~name~ lose stuff like ~name~’s ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:phantom_thieves,notSaidMarker:phantom_thieves_1,marker:phantom_thieves_1=cheer,It’s not a game, I’m not a robot AI chal-leng-ing you~~ Well, I <i>am</i>. But I’m not challenging as much as I’m winning…

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:japanese,notSaidMarker:japanese_1,marker:japanese_1=nonplussed,I don’t think I need to tell ~name~ to come to Japan! He’s from there, just like me!~ I could probably tell him to come in this game though…

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_1,marker:scottish_1=nonplussed,~Name~ sounds like Sean Connery. I heard he likes to sit on couches or something. ~Name~ doesn’t seem the type to keep his ~clothing~ on a couch.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_1,marker:white_hair_1=smart,~Name~’s character designer was kind of lazy… they didn’t even put in her hair dye…
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_1,marker:pink_hair_1=nonplussed,I match! Well, with his ~clothing~ only, not so much.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:green_eyes,notSaidMarker:green_eyes_2,marker:green_eyes_2=rage,Offended! I’m offended. ~name~’s eyes aren’t as nice as mine, right?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=serious,I’m not mad about ~player~’s ~clothing~. I mean, I like what he’s showing me. Kind of flattering.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=prattle,Pretty lewd, taking your ~clothing~ off even after you’re showing me your cock.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_1,marker:swiss_1=smart,~Name~ seems awfully impartial but somehow very collected. Is ~name~... German?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_1,marker:unusual_skin_1=discomfort,Some kind of alien character, I think… or maybe a monster… He even wears his ~clothing~ weird…
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:brunette,notSaidMarker:brunette_1,marker:brunette_1=exposit,Uh huh, uh huh. he's got brunette hair… oh! I see. It’s like mine. Is ~player~ trying to match me with rivals?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_1,marker:short_hair_1=exposit,There’s not a lot of people with short hair… isn’t that supposed to be for characters in games like this…?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_2,marker:blue_hair_2=exult,Blue hair is common in shows and games, but not in real life. Well, I am real, right? So does that make ~name~ real? I’m more real. I talk and play games, after all!
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:avengers,notSaidMarker:avengers_1,marker:avengers_1=sprightly,Avengers Avengers, assemble! They’re like the Boku no Hero in the west, right?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_1,marker:blue_hair_1=exult,~Clothing~... okay, okay, get to the good stuff. I want to see if this game makes his pubes and head hair match.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_1,marker:amber_eyes_1=smug,If my eyes were different, I’d want eyes like ~name~. I would look really cool. But his ~clothing~ was okay too.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:german,notSaidMarker:german_1,marker:german_1=discomfort,So orderly. ~name~ is German, right? Even his ~clothing~ comes off like a robot.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for him.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:human=tap,Hum… he’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ he’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_1,marker:australian_1=prattle,I like his accent more than his ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_accessory,filter:overwatch,notSaidMarker:overwatch_2,marker:overwatch_2=exult,~Name~ is from that one game that’s anime call of duty, right? He is very cute. But so bloodthirsty, killing his friends over and over.

2-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_2,marker:blue_eyes_2=pleased,His ~clothing~ matches his blue eyes. Good choice, Mr. ~name~. Good use of your closet.

2-female_removing_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…

3-male_removing_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?

3-male_removing_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.

3-male_removing_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_2,marker:black_hair_2=smart,Very few 3D boys dye their hair to look like mine. I think if I weren’t an AI, mine would look like ~name~’s, right?

3-male_removing_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_2,marker:unusual_skin_2=serious,His ~clothing~ is pretty, but his skin is very cool. I have human-type skin, but the nanomachines in my blood could turn me ~name~’s color. That would be nice.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_1,marker:tan_lines_1=glasses,Should I even know ~name~ has tan lines? He does, though. I think it’s cute.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_2,marker:short_hair_2=sprightly,Maybe long hair is better since you can do more stuff with it to look cool, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_1,marker:ponytail_1=pleased,Swish swish, swoosh swoosh. I’d do that if I had a ponytail. ~Name~ just takes off his ~clothing~.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_1,marker:teen_titans_1=exposit,I think I’ve seen this one! ~name~’s like one of those boys with super powers, but lives in the giant T, right? If I had a house, I’d want an A-frame.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:dark_eyes,notSaidMarker:dark_eyes_2,marker:dark_eyes_2=serious,Creepy. But cute. I like cute but creepy things. Like kittens. Or ~clothing~.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:dark-skinned,notSaidMarker:dark-skinned_1,marker:dark-skinned_1=install,Ohhh, I like him more without his ~clothing~. He's got such a nice contrast to me.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:dark-skinned,notSaidMarker:dark-skinned_2,marker:dark-skinned_2=pleased,~Name~’s skin is very cool. He seems like he’d be the type of person who spends a lot of time doing cool things. Or maybe he’s more hot. Hmm…  Hot.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_1,marker:fair-skinned_1=stretch,~Clothing~ is boring… but I think fair-skinned is a default tag? Oh, wait, it isn’t? I guess it’s just what people like seeing naked.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_2,marker:fair-skinned_2=sprightly,Without his ~clothing~, ~name~ is going to look like me, isn’t he? I kind of like the idea of seeing myself naked, so ~name~’s actually very helpful!

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:formal_attire,notSaidMarker:formal_attire_2,marker:formal_attire_2=serious,It’s no fun to play a game like this if I can’t customize my outfit.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:green_eyes,notSaidMarker:green_eyes_1,marker:green_eyes_1=smug,Oh, I match ~name~’s eyes. Mine look fancier though. It helps being a superintelligent AI.

3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=smug,Well, I guess my socks and gloves would come after I take off other stuff… if I can even take those things off without bugs.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for him.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=tap,Hum… he’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ he’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_1,marker:amber_eyes_1=smug,If my eyes were different, I’d want eyes like ~name~. I would look really cool. But his ~clothing~ was okay too.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_2,marker:australian_2=pleased,Australian people sound like they’re always having a good time. It makes it easy to make ~name~ lose stuff like ~name~’s ~clothing~.

3-male_removed_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_2,marker:black_hair_2=smart,Very few 3D boys dye their hair to look like mine. I think if I weren’t an AI, mine would look like ~name~’s, right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blade,notSaidMarker:blade_1,marker:blade_1=peeved,Swords are okay. I think lightsabers are better. Or… you know. Those are kind of a sword, right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blade,notSaidMarker:blade_2,marker:blade_2=pleased,Do you draw ~name~ with swords too? I mean, I see fanart that’s me with a penis. I don’t think I have one of those though. Maybe if I had another Kizuna with a penis we would do it. Hmm...

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:brunette,notSaidMarker:brunette_2,marker:brunette_2=nonplussed,I don’t think ~name~ will make a good rival, even if his hair looks kind of like mine.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:green_eyes,notSaidMarker:green_eyes_2,marker:green_eyes_2=rage,Offended! I’m offended. ~name~’s eyes aren’t as nice as mine, right?
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:green_hair,notSaidMarker:green_hair_1,marker:green_hair_1=confident,Ooo… ~Name~ has shiny hair. Very glowy. Is he like Spiderman? Radioactive!
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_2,marker:blue_hair_2=exult,Blue hair is common in shows and games, but not in real life. Well, I am real, right? So does that make ~name~ real? I’m more real. I talk and play games, after all!
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:danganronpa,notSaidMarker:danganronpa_2,marker:danganronpa_2=smug,If I were a student in Danganronpa… I would be the ultimate AI. Ob-vi-ous-ly.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:danganronpa,notSaidMarker:danganronpa_1,marker:danganronpa_1=nonplussed,Oh, ~name~ is from a Danganronpa. That game is fun! I just wish I could play as the villain…
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:dark_eyes,notSaidMarker:dark_eyes_2,marker:dark_eyes_2=serious,Creepy. But cute. I like cute but creepy things. Like kittens. Or ~clothing~.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:dark-skinned,notSaidMarker:dark-skinned_2,marker:dark-skinned_2=pleased,~Name~’s skin is very cool. He seems like he’d be the type of person who spends a lot of time doing cool things. Or maybe he’s more hot. Hmm…  Hot.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_2,marker:scandanavian_2=smug,Meatball, meatball, ~name~’s about meatballs and long winters. Probably very good at looking at shoes.

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_1,marker:mystery_inc_1=serious,Ohh… Scooby Dooby Doo! Where are you? ~name~ needs some help from you now.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_1,marker:scottish_1=nonplussed,~Name~ sounds like Sean Connery. I heard he likes to sit on couches or something. ~Name~ doesn’t seem the type to keep his ~clothing~ on a couch.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_2,marker:scottish_2=ohnoes,I can’t drink, so I’m not sure what the appeal of Scotland is. Maybe it’s true that ~name~ came here to get away? I don’t know. He's not real. His ~clothing~ maybe…?

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_1,marker:pale_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think the production values of this game are very high. ~name~’s eyes didn’t even load in.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_2,marker:russian_2=glasses,~name~ was picked because he’s Russian, right? I like his accent. It’s very serious! But I don’t get it. He’s not going very fast.

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_1,marker:pokemon_1=discomfort,Ohh… ~name~ is a Pokemon trainer, right? My team is Sylveon, Togekiss, Flygon, Latias, Lo-pun-ny, and Skitty. It’s the best, you just don’t know it yet.

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_2,marker:pokemon_2=smart,I read on Smogon that my team isn’t good compared to ~name~’s… but he lost and I didn’t. I’m just a genius battler.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_1,marker:ponytail_1=pleased,Swish swish, swoosh swoosh. I’d do that if I had a ponytail. ~Name~ just takes off his ~clothing~.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_2,marker:pale-skinned_2=confident,I wonder if I should get remodeled to look like ~name~, or I’d blend into my clothing more. Like a ghost. Or a chameleon. Hm…
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_1,marker:pale-skinned_1=sprightly,Ooh… you can even tell ~name~ is bluffing. And for his ~clothing~! So cute!

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_2,marker:pale_eyes_2=askance,~Name~’s eyes look cool. I don’t think they loaded in right. Unless they’re suppose to look like that?
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_1,marker:red_eyes_1=confident,Oooooh… ~name~’s using some sort of power up. Don’t be mad, ~name~! It’s just ~clothing~!
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_1,marker:russian_1=smart,So spooky. ~name~ seems like he’d warm up with some soup and drinks though. I think he’s… Russian?
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_1,marker:rwby_1=serious,~Name~ is here! But not one of the cute girls with big guns! My favorite is the robot girl though. She comes back, right?

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=smart,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… he isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_2,marker:violet_eyes_2=askance,~Name~’s got violet eyes and ~name~’s got violet ~clothing~. I think. Oh. Vi-o-<i>lent</i>. Not sure how you’d attack with his ~clothing~ though.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_1,marker:wand_1=cheer,Mahou shoujo Kizuna AI-chan desu! That’s what I’d say if I had a tool like ~name~’s ~clothing~.

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_1,marker:masked_1=discomfort,Is ~name~ a criminal or a superhero? I think superheroes wear masks more.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_1,marker:weapon_1=tap,Ah, oh no, wait! <i>*click click click*,</i> this isn’t the type of game I wanted! Unless he’s already lost his weapon… hmm… I’m thinking I’d look cool with a boomerang--a slingshot--rokketsu launcher!
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_2,marker:long_hair_2=nonplussed,I like long hair. If you model it like ~name~, you can do all kinds of hair styles. I’m just lazy and can’t really see myself-- changing my hair.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_2,marker:masked_2=smart,Oh, ~clothing~... boring. ~Name~’s mask is more interesting. Can I ask ~name~ about it?
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_1,marker:medium_hair_1=exposit,Eh? Okay, ~clothing~, kind of cute, but a boring accessory. What tags do you have, ~name~? Medium hair… I’m not sure what to say about that.
4-male_removing_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_1,marker:violet_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think ~name~ is supposed to be from a normal world. His ~clothing~ is, but eyes like his aren’t usual. Right?

4-male_removing_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_2,marker:russian_2=glasses,~name~ was picked because he’s Russian, right? I like his accent. It’s very serious! But I don’t get it. He’s not going very fast.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:american,notSaidMarker:american_1,marker:american_1=glasses,Oh, say can you see~ ~name~’s ~clothing~-- Gack. English is hard to do.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_1,marker:bodysuit_1=nonplussed,Ooh… kinky. ~name~ likes that bodysuit, right? Is kinky the word for the shiny bondage stuff? I like that.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_1,marker:russian_1=smart,So spooky. ~name~ seems like he’d warm up with some soup and drinks though. I think he’s… Russian?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_2,marker:korean_2=ohnoes,~Clothing~ seems vain. Oh… the… game… says… he… is… Korean! Oh! Okay. ~name~ seems consistent.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:american,notSaidMarker:american_2,marker:american_2=sprightly,Hamburger-san’s ~clothing~ is coming off! Japan will win, with Kizuna AI as his ultimate champion!
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:canadian,notSaidMarker:canadian_2,marker:canadian_2=exult,Is ~clothing~ popular in Canada? It doesn’t look very nice. I bet if I insult ~name~, ~name~ will apologize.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_1,marker:chinese_1=confident,The Chinese never made a superpowerful AI like me. They can’t beat Japan in card games either!

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_1,marker:pink_hair_1=nonplussed,I match! Well, with his ~clothing~ only, not so much.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_1,marker:wand_1=cheer,Mahou shoujo Kizuna AI-chan desu! That’s what I’d say if I had a tool like ~name~’s ~clothing~.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_1,marker:choker_1=ohnoes,Lots of accessories in this game. Is that to pad things out? Like ~clothing~, or that choker ~name~ had.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for him.
4-male_removed_accessory,target:human=tap,Hum… he’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ he’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_2,marker:chinese_2=smart,Is this a Chinese game? Sometimes the buttons don’t work… I tried this earlier and I couldn’t find some characters’ epilogues, which is a thing I want to see again.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_2,marker:scandanavian_2=smug,Meatball, meatball, ~name~’s about meatballs and long winters. Probably very good at looking at shoes.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=nonplussed,Oh. He's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into his. Lots of skincare.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_1,marker:amber_eyes_1=smug,If my eyes were different, I’d want eyes like ~name~. I would look really cool. But his ~clothing~ was okay too.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:ginger,notSaidMarker:ginger_2,marker:ginger_2=cheer,Since ~name~’s got red hair, ~name~ will be the fiery type, right? I see, I see! Burning with passion, ~name~’s ~clothing~!

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_2,marker:blue_hair_2=exult,Blue hair is common in shows and games, but not in real life. Well, I am real, right? So does that make ~name~ real? I’m more real. I talk and play games, after all!
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_1,marker:blue_hair_1=exult,~Clothing~... okay, okay, get to the good stuff. I want to see if this game makes his pubes and head hair match.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_2,marker:black_hair_2=smart,Very few 3D boys dye their hair to look like mine. I think if I weren’t an AI, mine would look like ~name~’s, right?

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_2,marker:long_hair_2=nonplussed,I like long hair. If you model it like ~name~, you can do all kinds of hair styles. I’m just lazy and can’t really see myself-- changing my hair.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_1,marker:black_hair_1=pleased,Okay, okay, the one with the black hair is taking off his ~clothing~ now… does ~player~ have a thing for Asians?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:glasses,notSaidMarker:glasses_2,marker:glasses_2=glasses,Do ~name~’s glasses help him see? Is he going to lose power without them? I should target those…

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:bald,notSaidMarker:bald_2,marker:bald_2=install,I think my model has bald parts too where the hair isn’t coded in. It’s pretty scary, actually.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_2,marker:pokemon_2=smart,I read on Smogon that my team isn’t good compared to ~name~’s… but he lost and I didn’t. I’m just a genius battler.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_2,marker:australian_2=pleased,Australian people sound like they’re always having a good time. It makes it easy to make ~name~ lose stuff like ~name~’s ~clothing~.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:green_eyes,notSaidMarker:green_eyes_1,marker:green_eyes_1=smug,Oh, I match ~name~’s eyes. Mine look fancier though. It helps being a superintelligent AI.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_1,marker:ponytail_1=pleased,Swish swish, swoosh swoosh. I’d do that if I had a ponytail. ~Name~ just takes off his ~clothing~.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blade,notSaidMarker:blade_1,marker:blade_1=peeved,Swords are okay. I think lightsabers are better. Or… you know. Those are kind of a sword, right?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:arabian,notSaidMarker:arabian_2,marker:arabian_2=install,~Clothing~? ~name~, is that all? No lamps or oil?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_2,marker:blue_eyes_2=pleased,His ~clothing~ matches his blue eyes. Good choice, Mr. ~name~. Good use of your closet.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_1,marker:red_eyes_1=confident,Oooooh… ~name~’s using some sort of power up. Don’t be mad, ~name~! It’s just ~clothing~!
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_1,marker:medium_hair_1=exposit,Eh? Okay, ~clothing~, kind of cute, but a boring accessory. What tags do you have, ~name~? Medium hair… I’m not sure what to say about that.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_2,marker:leotard_2=pleased,I wonder if his ~clothing~ would look good on me. I don’t think so, but the leotard might. I’m equipped for it, I think.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_1,marker:blue_eyes_1=rage,Take that, blue eyes ~name~! That’s how I remember names. As a superintelligent AI, I have to remember somehow. It’s no fun if I just give out the answer in 0.1 seconds.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:green_eyes,notSaidMarker:green_eyes_2,marker:green_eyes_2=rage,Offended! I’m offended. ~name~’s eyes aren’t as nice as mine, right?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blonde,notSaidMarker:blonde_2,marker:blonde_2=exposit,Someone told me blondes have more fun, but it’s always the blonde AIs that go crazy. Oh. I guess they do have more fun then.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blonde,notSaidMarker:blonde_1,marker:blonde_1=nonplussed,~Name~’s got shiny blonde hair… I see, I see. ~Clothing~ is coming off…

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:blade,notSaidMarker:blade_2,marker:blade_2=pleased,Do you draw ~name~ with swords too? I mean, I see fanart that’s me with a penis. I don’t think I have one of those though. Maybe if I had another Kizuna with a penis we would do it. Hmm...
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_2,marker:masked_2=smart,Oh, ~clothing~... boring. ~Name~’s mask is more interesting. Can I ask ~name~ about it?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_2,marker:ponytail_2=install,If my hair were like that, I’d be a cobra. You would look at it, then I’d have undressed! Also then fang. Rawr! Kizuna-AIttack!

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_1,marker:pale_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think the production values of this game are very high. ~name~’s eyes didn’t even load in.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_1,marker:mixed_heritage_1=shock,I can’t find ~name~’s IP address! Oh. He's a character. Right. I suppose he appeals to people who like multiple things?
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_2,marker:fair-skinned_2=sprightly,Without his ~clothing~, ~name~ is going to look like me, isn’t he? I kind of like the idea of seeing myself naked, so ~name~’s actually very helpful!
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_1,marker:unusual_skin_1=discomfort,Some kind of alien character, I think… or maybe a monster… He even wears his ~clothing~ weird…
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:hispanic,notSaidMarker:hispanic_1,marker:hispanic_1=confident,So passionate, ~name~! If you were real like me, I might fall for you.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_1,marker:fair-skinned_1=stretch,~Clothing~ is boring… but I think fair-skinned is a default tag? Oh, wait, it isn’t? I guess it’s just what people like seeing naked.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=smart,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… he isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_2,marker:unusual_skin_2=serious,His ~clothing~ is pretty, but his skin is very cool. I have human-type skin, but the nanomachines in my blood could turn me ~name~’s color. That would be nice.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:exotic_hair,notSaidMarker:exotic_hair_2,marker:exotic_hair_2=glasses,Ex-o-tic hair. Oh, so he’s like me. Very relatable. Even if he’s not an AI, I think I’d have ~clothing~ like ~name~’s.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_1,marker:swiss_1=smart,~Name~ seems awfully impartial but somehow very collected. Is ~name~... German?

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:ginger,notSaidMarker:ginger_1,marker:ginger_1=toeTouch,The redheads in these games are always sultry. I think if I were going to kiss one of them, ~name~ would be the one I want.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_2,marker:mixed_heritage_2=nonplussed,It seems like ~name~ has a complex life, being from two cultures. I’m glad I’m just digital. This makes all culture my culture. Even this game is part of my virtual culture.
4-male_removed_accessory,filter:german,notSaidMarker:german_2,marker:german_2=sprightly,Beep beep boop boop. That’s not Ai-chan talking, that’s what ~name~’s brain sounds like.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:formal_attire,notSaidMarker:formal_attire_2,marker:formal_attire_2=serious,It’s no fun to play a game like this if I can’t customize my outfit.

4-male_removed_accessory,filter:hat,notSaidMarker:hat_2,marker:hat_2=discomfort,I don’t like hats. I like to have hats, like ~name~’s but I’m too cute to be obscured. Unless it’s a hat like ~name~’s. I think.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:hat,notSaidMarker:hat_2,marker:hat_2=discomfort,I don’t like hats. I like to have hats, like ~name~’s but I’m too cute to be obscured. Unless it’s a hat like ~name~’s. I think.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:hat,notSaidMarker:hat_1,marker:hat_1=nonplussed,I have a rhyme about ~name~ I just thought of. ~Name~ has a hat. And I know how I can react to that.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_1,marker:fair-skinned_1=stretch,~Clothing~ is boring… but I think fair-skinned is a default tag? Oh, wait, it isn’t? I guess it’s just what people like seeing naked.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_1,marker:blue_eyes_1=rage,Take that, blue eyes ~name~! That’s how I remember names. As a superintelligent AI, I have to remember somehow. It’s no fun if I just give out the answer in 0.1 seconds.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=nonplussed,Eh? Were you really in such a hurry to have ~player~ on display like that?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=domo,Hum… I guess the debug thing is working. You really can make ~name~ undress in any order!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:english,notSaidMarker:english_2,marker:english_2=glasses,~Name~ is so sunshiney for being so calm. He seems to carry on well.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:german,notSaidMarker:german_2,marker:german_2=sprightly,Beep beep boop boop. That’s not Ai-chan talking, that’s what ~name~’s brain sounds like.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_1,marker:blue_hair_1=exult,~Clothing~... okay, okay, get to the good stuff. I want to see if this game makes his pubes and head hair match.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:german,notSaidMarker:german_1,marker:german_1=discomfort,So orderly. ~name~ is German, right? Even his ~clothing~ comes off like a robot.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:exotic_hair,notSaidMarker:exotic_hair_2,marker:exotic_hair_2=glasses,Ex-o-tic hair. Oh, so he’s like me. Very relatable. Even if he’s not an AI, I think I’d have ~clothing~ like ~name~’s.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:blade,notSaidMarker:blade_1,marker:blade_1=peeved,Swords are okay. I think lightsabers are better. Or… you know. Those are kind of a sword, right?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:exotic_hair,notSaidMarker:exotic_hair_1,marker:exotic_hair_1=sprightly,Ohh… fancy anime hair… ~Clothing~ though… ah, yes. ~Clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:green_hair,notSaidMarker:green_hair_2,marker:green_hair_2=smug,~Clothing~... ~Clothing~... oh. He has green hair. Is that important? Like super-Saiyan ~name~? I hope he doesn’t become better at cards… I like beating him!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:hispanic,notSaidMarker:hispanic_2,marker:hispanic_2=peeved,Oh, so spicy. What is spicy? I think I’m supposed to say that, even when ~name~ takes off his ~clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_2,marker:blue_hair_2=exult,Blue hair is common in shows and games, but not in real life. Well, I am real, right? So does that make ~name~ real? I’m more real. I talk and play games, after all!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_2,marker:blue_eyes_2=pleased,His ~clothing~ matches his blue eyes. Good choice, Mr. ~name~. Good use of your closet.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=shock,Eh? Are you just playing around, ~name~?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=tap,Hum… I guess you have some more lives left?

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_2,marker:short_hair_2=sprightly,Maybe long hair is better since you can do more stuff with it to look cool, ~name~.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_1,marker:short_hair_1=exposit,There’s not a lot of people with short hair… isn’t that supposed to be for characters in games like this…?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_2,marker:scottish_2=ohnoes,I can’t drink, so I’m not sure what the appeal of Scotland is. Maybe it’s true that ~name~ came here to get away? I don’t know. He's not real. His ~clothing~ maybe…?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_1,marker:scottish_1=nonplussed,~Name~ sounds like Sean Connery. I heard he likes to sit on couches or something. ~Name~ doesn’t seem the type to keep his ~clothing~ on a couch.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:avengers,notSaidMarker:avengers_2,marker:avengers_2=confident,~Name~, assemble! ~name~’s very big in the movies. But I wonder if ~name~ would be bigger without his ~clothing~...
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_1,marker:scantily_clad_1=glasses,I’m not exactly hiding my body parts, but ~name~ started looking like he didn’t bother.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_2,marker:scandanavian_2=smug,Meatball, meatball, ~name~’s about meatballs and long winters. Probably very good at looking at shoes.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_1,marker:choker_1=ohnoes,Lots of accessories in this game. Is that to pad things out? Like ~clothing~, or that choker ~name~ had.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:armor,notSaidMarker:armor_1,marker:armor_1=smug,~Name~, your ~clothing~ is fine, but your armor was very cool. I would want cute armor though. Like a unicorn knight. Because I’m one of a kind.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_1,marker:rwby_1=serious,~Name~ is here! But not one of the cute girls with big guns! My favorite is the robot girl though. She comes back, right?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_2,marker:russian_2=glasses,~name~ was picked because he’s Russian, right? I like his accent. It’s very serious! But I don’t get it. He’s not going very fast.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:dark_eyes,notSaidMarker:dark_eyes_2,marker:dark_eyes_2=serious,Creepy. But cute. I like cute but creepy things. Like kittens. Or ~clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_2,marker:chinese_2=smart,Is this a Chinese game? Sometimes the buttons don’t work… I tried this earlier and I couldn’t find some characters’ epilogues, which is a thing I want to see again.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:arabian,notSaidMarker:arabian_2,marker:arabian_2=install,~Clothing~? ~name~, is that all? No lamps or oil?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:danganronpa,notSaidMarker:danganronpa_1,marker:danganronpa_1=nonplussed,Oh, ~name~ is from a Danganronpa. That game is fun! I just wish I could play as the villain…
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_1,marker:red_eyes_1=confident,Oooooh… ~name~’s using some sort of power up. Don’t be mad, ~name~! It’s just ~clothing~!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:armor,notSaidMarker:armor_2,marker:armor_2=smug,Does ~name~ wear armor to every game like this, or is it just so ~name~ looks like he always does?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_1,marker:tan_lines_1=glasses,Should I even know ~name~ has tan lines? He does, though. I think it’s cute.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:danganronpa,notSaidMarker:danganronpa_2,marker:danganronpa_2=smug,If I were a student in Danganronpa… I would be the ultimate AI. Ob-vi-ous-ly.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_1,marker:weapon_1=tap,Ah, oh no, wait! <i>*click click click*,</i> this isn’t the type of game I wanted! Unless he’s already lost his weapon… hmm… I’m thinking I’d look cool with a boomerang--a slingshot--rokketsu launcher!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_2,marker:violet_eyes_2=askance,~Name~’s got violet eyes and ~name~’s got violet ~clothing~. I think. Oh. Vi-o-<i>lent</i>. Not sure how you’d attack with his ~clothing~ though.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_1,marker:violet_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think ~name~ is supposed to be from a normal world. His ~clothing~ is, but eyes like his aren’t usual. Right?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:very_long_hair,notSaidMarker:very_long_hair_2,marker:very_long_hair_2=confident,Long hair… no! <i>Very</i> long hair!</i> I bet lots of girls would help you comb your hair, ~name~-chan!

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_2,marker:australian_2=pleased,Australian people sound like they’re always having a good time. It makes it easy to make ~name~ lose stuff like ~name~’s ~clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_1,marker:white_hair_1=smart,~Name~’s character designer was kind of lazy… they didn’t even put in her hair dye…
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_2,marker:unusual_skin_2=serious,His ~clothing~ is pretty, but his skin is very cool. I have human-type skin, but the nanomachines in my blood could turn me ~name~’s color. That would be nice.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_1,marker:unusual_skin_1=discomfort,Some kind of alien character, I think… or maybe a monster… He even wears his ~clothing~ weird…
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_1,marker:thong_1=peeved,“I’m not supposed to talk about ~name~’s underwear until I can see it…” But it’s a thong, that seems more interesting than his ~clothing~... oops.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:avengers,notSaidMarker:avengers_1,marker:avengers_1=sprightly,Avengers Avengers, assemble! They’re like the Boku no Hero in the west, right?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:dark_eyes,notSaidMarker:dark_eyes_1,marker:dark_eyes_1=prattle,I like this game! When I move left and right, ~name~’s eyes change color.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_1,marker:teen_titans_1=exposit,I think I’ve seen this one! ~name~’s like one of those boys with super powers, but lives in the giant T, right? If I had a house, I’d want an A-frame.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_2,marker:tan_lines_2=glasses,Tan lines are cute on ~name~. I wish I had some, but I don’t have a sun either. Just sunglasses.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=smart,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… he isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_2,marker:ponytail_2=install,If my hair were like that, I’d be a cobra. You would look at it, then I’d have undressed! Also then fang. Rawr! Kizuna-AIttack!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_2,marker:mixed_heritage_2=nonplussed,It seems like ~name~ has a complex life, being from two cultures. I’m glad I’m just digital. This makes all culture my culture. Even this game is part of my virtual culture.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_2,marker:amber_eyes_2=exposit,~Clothing~. Okay, okay… it’s hard to fill conversations over ~clothing~... Oh, very interesting eyes. Are they more orange or yellow? They’re very shiny!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_1,marker:mixed_heritage_1=shock,I can’t find ~name~’s IP address! Oh. He's a character. Right. I suppose he appeals to people who like multiple things?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_1,marker:messy_hair_1=ohnoes,~Name~’s hair is all messed up… is ~name~ worried about his ~clothing~...? That’s a thing that happens, right?

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:brunette,notSaidMarker:brunette_1,marker:brunette_1=exposit,Uh huh, uh huh. he's got brunette hair… oh! I see. It’s like mine. Is ~player~ trying to match me with rivals?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_1,marker:medium_hair_1=exposit,Eh? Okay, ~clothing~, kind of cute, but a boring accessory. What tags do you have, ~name~? Medium hair… I’m not sure what to say about that.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_1,marker:amber_eyes_1=smug,If my eyes were different, I’d want eyes like ~name~. I would look really cool. But his ~clothing~ was okay too.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_1,marker:masked_1=discomfort,Is ~name~ a criminal or a superhero? I think superheroes wear masks more.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_2,marker:long_hair_2=nonplussed,I like long hair. If you model it like ~name~, you can do all kinds of hair styles. I’m just lazy and can’t really see myself-- changing my hair.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_2,marker:leotard_2=pleased,I wonder if his ~clothing~ would look good on me. I don’t think so, but the leotard might. I’m equipped for it, I think.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_3,marker:korean_3=domo,Huh. ~name~ is Korean. I bet he likes boybands and K-Pop! I know I do! Truly truly!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:human=tap,Next, next, next. ~player~’s ~clothing~ doesn’t even have any lines…

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=nonplussed,Oh. He's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into his. Lots of skincare.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:japanese,notSaidMarker:japanese_2,marker:japanese_2=serious,~Name~’s clearly already a big fan of mine, since he’s from Japan.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:brunette,notSaidMarker:brunette_2,marker:brunette_2=nonplussed,I don’t think ~name~ will make a good rival, even if his hair looks kind of like mine.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:dark-skinned,notSaidMarker:dark-skinned_2,marker:dark-skinned_2=pleased,~Name~’s skin is very cool. He seems like he’d be the type of person who spends a lot of time doing cool things. Or maybe he’s more hot. Hmm…  Hot.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_1,marker:chinese_1=confident,The Chinese never made a superpowerful AI like me. They can’t beat Japan in card games either!
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_1,marker:ponytail_1=pleased,Swish swish, swoosh swoosh. I’d do that if I had a ponytail. ~Name~ just takes off his ~clothing~.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_2,marker:pale-skinned_2=confident,I wonder if I should get remodeled to look like ~name~, or I’d blend into my clothing more. Like a ghost. Or a chameleon. Hm…

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_1,marker:pale_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think the production values of this game are very high. ~name~’s eyes didn’t even load in.

5-male_removing_accessory,filter:canadian,notSaidMarker:canadian_2,marker:canadian_2=exult,Is ~clothing~ popular in Canada? It doesn’t look very nice. I bet if I insult ~name~, ~name~ will apologize.
5-male_removing_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_2,marker:wand_2=domo,Are you going to do tricks with your ~clothing~? I think you have a wand somewhere, but unless you’re hiding it in one of your holes, I… oh, have you always had that?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:green_hair,notSaidMarker:green_hair_2,marker:green_hair_2=smug,~Clothing~... ~Clothing~... oh. He has green hair. Is that important? Like super-Saiyan ~name~? I hope he doesn’t become better at cards… I like beating him!

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:italian,notSaidMarker:italian_1,marker:italian_1=sprightly,Italians like spaghetti… is that why his ~clothing~ keeps flopping all over the place?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:italian,notSaidMarker:italian_2,marker:italian_2=pleased,Italians use a lot of noodles… are Italians just Japanese Europeans? I can see myself wearing ~clothing~ and everything!

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=nonplussed,Oh. He's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into his. Lots of skincare.

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_2,marker:leotard_2=pleased,I wonder if his ~clothing~ would look good on me. I don’t think so, but the leotard might. I’m equipped for it, I think.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_2,marker:long_hair_2=nonplussed,I like long hair. If you model it like ~name~, you can do all kinds of hair styles. I’m just lazy and can’t really see myself-- changing my hair.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:hat,notSaidMarker:hat_1,marker:hat_1=nonplussed,I have a rhyme about ~name~ I just thought of. ~Name~ has a hat. And I know how I can react to that.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_1,marker:masked_1=discomfort,Is ~name~ a criminal or a superhero? I think superheroes wear masks more.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:gun,notSaidMarker:gun_2,marker:gun_2=nonplussed,Can I ask ~name~ for his gun? I know we don’t get to put clothes back on. But while he takes off his ~clothing~, I think I would look very cool.

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_1,marker:fair-skinned_1=stretch,~Clothing~ is boring… but I think fair-skinned is a default tag? Oh, wait, it isn’t? I guess it’s just what people like seeing naked.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_2,marker:fair-skinned_2=sprightly,Without his ~clothing~, ~name~ is going to look like me, isn’t he? I kind of like the idea of seeing myself naked, so ~name~’s actually very helpful!
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:formal_attire,notSaidMarker:formal_attire_1,marker:formal_attire_1=pleased,Ooooh. Can I try on all the fancy stuff ~name~ wore? Like the ~clothing~?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:formal_attire,notSaidMarker:formal_attire_2,marker:formal_attire_2=serious,It’s no fun to play a game like this if I can’t customize my outfit.

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_1,marker:pokemon_1=discomfort,Ohh… ~name~ is a Pokemon trainer, right? My team is Sylveon, Togekiss, Flygon, Latias, Lo-pun-ny, and Skitty. It’s the best, you just don’t know it yet.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_2,marker:pokemon_2=smart,I read on Smogon that my team isn’t good compared to ~name~’s… but he lost and I didn’t. I’m just a genius battler.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_2,marker:ponytail_2=install,If my hair were like that, I’d be a cobra. You would look at it, then I’d have undressed! Also then fang. Rawr! Kizuna-AIttack!
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_1,marker:white_hair_1=smart,~Name~’s character designer was kind of lazy… they didn’t even put in her hair dye…
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_1,marker:red_eyes_1=confident,Oooooh… ~name~’s using some sort of power up. Don’t be mad, ~name~! It’s just ~clothing~!
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_1,marker:rwby_1=serious,~Name~ is here! But not one of the cute girls with big guns! My favorite is the robot girl though. She comes back, right?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_1,marker:russian_1=smart,So spooky. ~name~ seems like he’d warm up with some soup and drinks though. I think he’s… Russian?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_1,marker:pink_hair_1=nonplussed,I match! Well, with his ~clothing~ only, not so much.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_1,marker:medium_hair_1=exposit,Eh? Okay, ~clothing~, kind of cute, but a boring accessory. What tags do you have, ~name~? Medium hair… I’m not sure what to say about that.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:phantom_thieves,notSaidMarker:phantom_thieves_2,marker:phantom_thieves_2=confident,A river in a dry land~~ The last ace in ~name~’s lost hand~~

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_1,marker:messy_hair_1=ohnoes,~Name~’s hair is all messed up… is ~name~ worried about his ~clothing~...? That’s a thing that happens, right?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_1,marker:mixed_heritage_1=shock,I can’t find ~name~’s IP address! Oh. He's a character. Right. I suppose he appeals to people who like multiple things?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_2,marker:mixed_heritage_2=nonplussed,It seems like ~name~ has a complex life, being from two cultures. I’m glad I’m just digital. This makes all culture my culture. Even this game is part of my virtual culture.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:my_hero_academia,notSaidMarker:my_hero_academia_1,marker:my_hero_academia_1=serious,Palussu ultura! ~name~’s from Boku No Hero, right?

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:overwatch,notSaidMarker:overwatch_1,marker:overwatch_1=prattle,Oh, from Team Fortress with anime boys? That game?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:overwatch,notSaidMarker:overwatch_2,marker:overwatch_2=exult,~Name~ is from that one game that’s anime call of duty, right? He is very cute. But so bloodthirsty, killing his friends over and over.

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_2,marker:pale-skinned_2=confident,I wonder if I should get remodeled to look like ~name~, or I’d blend into my clothing more. Like a ghost. Or a chameleon. Hm…
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_2,marker:wand_2=domo,Are you going to do tricks with your ~clothing~? I think you have a wand somewhere, but unless you’re hiding it in one of your holes, I… oh, have you always had that?

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=nonplussed,Hum… I guess even men have things after their ~clothing~ that’s sentimental...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=peeved,Eh? You’re not even making it a sexy stripping order!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=serious,I’m not mad about ~player~’s ~clothing~. I mean, I like what he’s showing me. Kind of flattering.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=prattle,Pretty lewd, taking your ~clothing~ off even after you’re showing me your cock.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=discomfort,My stuff is a lot bigger, y’know. I’m keeping it on after I’m mostly T-posed because I like it.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=smug,Well, I guess my socks and gloves would come after I take off other stuff… if I can even take those things off without bugs.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for him.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:human=tap,Hum… he’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ he’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
5-male_removed_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_1,marker:amber_eyes_1=smug,If my eyes were different, I’d want eyes like ~name~. I would look really cool. But his ~clothing~ was okay too.

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!

5-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_2,marker:black_hair_2=smart,Very few 3D boys dye their hair to look like mine. I think if I weren’t an AI, mine would look like ~name~’s, right?

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:armor,notSaidMarker:armor_1,marker:armor_1=smug,~Name~, your ~clothing~ is fine, but your armor was very cool. I would want cute armor though. Like a unicorn knight. Because I’m one of a kind.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_1,marker:choker_1=ohnoes,Lots of accessories in this game. Is that to pad things out? Like ~clothing~, or that choker ~name~ had.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_2,marker:chinese_2=smart,Is this a Chinese game? Sometimes the buttons don’t work… I tried this earlier and I couldn’t find some characters’ epilogues, which is a thing I want to see again.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_1,marker:chinese_1=confident,The Chinese never made a superpowerful AI like me. They can’t beat Japan in card games either!
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:canadian,notSaidMarker:canadian_2,marker:canadian_2=exult,Is ~clothing~ popular in Canada? It doesn’t look very nice. I bet if I insult ~name~, ~name~ will apologize.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:armor,notSaidMarker:armor_2,marker:armor_2=smug,Does ~name~ wear armor to every game like this, or is it just so ~name~ looks like he always does?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:arabian,notSaidMarker:arabian_2,marker:arabian_2=install,~Clothing~? ~name~, is that all? No lamps or oil?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:phantom_thieves,notSaidMarker:phantom_thieves_2,marker:phantom_thieves_2=confident,A river in a dry land~~ The last ace in ~name~’s lost hand~~

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_2,marker:unusual_skin_2=serious,His ~clothing~ is pretty, but his skin is very cool. I have human-type skin, but the nanomachines in my blood could turn me ~name~’s color. That would be nice.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:very_long_hair,notSaidMarker:very_long_hair_1,marker:very_long_hair_1=shock,I like his hair more than his ~clothing~. So long!

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_2,marker:pale-skinned_2=confident,I wonder if I should get remodeled to look like ~name~, or I’d blend into my clothing more. Like a ghost. Or a chameleon. Hm…
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_1,marker:violet_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think ~name~ is supposed to be from a normal world. His ~clothing~ is, but eyes like his aren’t usual. Right?

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_1,marker:pale_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think the production values of this game are very high. ~name~’s eyes didn’t even load in.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_1,marker:mystery_inc_1=serious,Ohh… Scooby Dooby Doo! Where are you? ~name~ needs some help from you now.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:my_hero_academia,notSaidMarker:my_hero_academia_2,marker:my_hero_academia_2=domo,~Name~’s ~clothing~ isn’t very Plus Ultra… we should see more soon, right? At least Boku No Hero isn’t on hiatus…

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_1,marker:thong_1=peeved,“I’m not supposed to talk about ~name~’s underwear until I can see it…” But it’s a thong, that seems more interesting than his ~clothing~... oops.

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_2,marker:scandanavian_2=smug,Meatball, meatball, ~name~’s about meatballs and long winters. Probably very good at looking at shoes.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_1,marker:russian_1=smart,So spooky. ~name~ seems like he’d warm up with some soup and drinks though. I think he’s… Russian?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_1,marker:scantily_clad_1=glasses,I’m not exactly hiding my body parts, but ~name~ started looking like he didn’t bother.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_1,marker:red_eyes_1=confident,Oooooh… ~name~’s using some sort of power up. Don’t be mad, ~name~! It’s just ~clothing~!
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_1,marker:scottish_1=nonplussed,~Name~ sounds like Sean Connery. I heard he likes to sit on couches or something. ~Name~ doesn’t seem the type to keep his ~clothing~ on a couch.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_1,marker:short_hair_1=exposit,There’s not a lot of people with short hair… isn’t that supposed to be for characters in games like this…?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_2,marker:short_hair_2=sprightly,Maybe long hair is better since you can do more stuff with it to look cool, ~name~.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_2,marker:ponytail_2=install,If my hair were like that, I’d be a cobra. You would look at it, then I’d have undressed! Also then fang. Rawr! Kizuna-AIttack!
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_1,marker:ponytail_1=pleased,Swish swish, swoosh swoosh. I’d do that if I had a ponytail. ~Name~ just takes off his ~clothing~.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_1,marker:swiss_1=smart,~name~ seems awfully impartial but somehow very collected. Is ~name~... German?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=smart,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… he isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_1,marker:tan_lines_1=glasses,Should I even know ~name~ has tan lines? He does, though. I think it’s cute.

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_1,marker:pokemon_1=discomfort,Ohh… ~name~ is a Pokemon trainer, right? My team is Sylveon, Togekiss, Flygon, Latias, Lo-pun-ny, and Skitty. It’s the best, you just don’t know it yet.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_2,marker:mixed_heritage_2=nonplussed,It seems like ~name~ has a complex life, being from two cultures. I’m glad I’m just digital. This makes all culture my culture. Even this game is part of my virtual culture.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_2,marker:scottish_2=ohnoes,I can’t drink, so I’m not sure what the appeal of Scotland is. Maybe it’s true that ~name~ came here to get away? I don’t know. He's not real. His ~clothing~ maybe…?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_1,marker:messy_hair_1=ohnoes,~Name~’s hair is all messed up… is ~name~ worried about his ~clothing~...? That’s a thing that happens, right?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_2,marker:long_hair_2=nonplussed,I like long hair. If you model it like ~name~, you can do all kinds of hair styles. I’m just lazy and can’t really see myself-- changing my hair.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_2,marker:leotard_2=pleased,I wonder if his ~clothing~ would look good on me. I don’t think so, but the leotard might. I’m equipped for it, I think.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_1,marker:masked_1=discomfort,Is ~name~ a criminal or a superhero? I think superheroes wear masks more.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:masked,notSaidMarker:masked_2,marker:masked_2=smart,Oh, ~clothing~... boring. ~Name~’s mask is more interesting. Can I ask ~name~ about it?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_1,marker:medium_hair_1=exposit,Eh? Okay, ~clothing~, kind of cute, but a boring accessory. What tags do you have, ~name~? Medium hair… I’m not sure what to say about that.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_2,marker:medium_hair_2=peeved,Okayokayokay! ~name~-- hass--- medium_hair. Huh? What can I say about this… I bet ~name~ with medium_penis would be more interesting!
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:japanese,notSaidMarker:japanese_1,marker:japanese_1=nonplussed,I don’t think I need to tell ~name~ to come to Japan! He’s from there, just like me!~ I could probably tell him to come in this game though…
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:italian,notSaidMarker:italian_1,marker:italian_1=sprightly,Italians like spaghetti… is that why his ~clothing~ keeps flopping all over the place?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:hispanic,notSaidMarker:hispanic_2,marker:hispanic_2=peeved,Oh, so spicy. What is spicy? I think I’m supposed to say that, even when ~name~ takes off his ~clothing~.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:italian,notSaidMarker:italian_2,marker:italian_2=pleased,Italians use a lot of noodles… are Italians just Japanese Europeans? I can see myself wearing ~clothing~ and everything!

-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:hat,notSaidMarker:hat_1,marker:hat_1=nonplussed,I have a rhyme about ~name~ I just thought of. ~Name~ has a hat. And I know how I can react to that.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_3,marker:korean_3=domo,Huh. ~name~ is Korean. I bet he likes boybands and K-Pop! I know I do! Truly truly!
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_1,marker:mixed_heritage_1=shock,I can’t find ~name~’s IP address! Oh. He's a character. Right. I suppose he appeals to people who like multiple things?
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:gun,notSaidMarker:gun_2,marker:gun_2=nonplussed,Can I ask ~name~ for his gun? I know we don’t get to put clothes back on. But while he takes off his ~clothing~, I think I would look very cool.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_2,marker:korean_2=ohnoes,~Clothing~ seems vain. Oh… the… game… says… he… is… Korean! Oh! Okay. ~name~ seems consistent.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=nonplussed,Oh. He's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into his. Lots of skincare.
-3-male_removing_accessory,filter:japanese,notSaidMarker:japanese_2,marker:japanese_2=serious,~Name~’s clearly already a big fan of mine, since he’s from Japan.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_2,marker:wand_2=domo,Are you going to do tricks with your ~clothing~? I think you have a wand somewhere, but unless you’re hiding it in one of your holes, I… oh, have you always had that?

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_1,marker:white_hair_1=smart,~Name~’s character designer was kind of lazy… they didn’t even put in her hair dye…
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_2,marker:pale_eyes_2=askance,~Name~’s eyes look cool. I don’t think they loaded in right. Unless they’re suppose to look like that?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_1,marker:pale-skinned_1=sprightly,Ooh… you can even tell ~name~ is bluffing. And for his ~clothing~! So cute!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_1,marker:wand_1=cheer,Mahou shoujo Kizuna AI-chan desu! That’s what I’d say if I had a tool like ~name~’s ~clothing~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:welsh,notSaidMarker:welsh_1,marker:welsh_1=sprightly,Ai-chan knows that Welsh have a dragon flag. Also they love sheep a lot. They’re very cute and fluffy, so that makes sense to me!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_1,marker:swiss_1=smart,~Name~ seems awfully impartial but somehow very collected. Is ~name~... German?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_2,marker:short_hair_2=sprightly,Maybe long hair is better since you can do more stuff with it to look cool, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale_eyes,notSaidMarker:pale_eyes_1,marker:pale_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think the production values of this game are very high. ~name~’s eyes didn’t even load in.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:overwatch,notSaidMarker:overwatch_2,marker:overwatch_2=exult,~Name~ is from that one game that’s anime call of duty, right? He is very cute. But so bloodthirsty, killing his friends over and over.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_1,marker:scottish_1=nonplussed,~Name~ sounds like Sean Connery. I heard he likes to sit on couches or something. ~Name~ doesn’t seem the type to keep his ~clothing~ on a couch.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_1,marker:weapon_1=tap,Ah, oh no, wait! <i>*click click click*,</i> this isn’t the type of game I wanted! Unless he’s already lost his weapon… hmm… I’m thinking I’d look cool with a boomerang--a slingshot--rokketsu launcher!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:overwatch,notSaidMarker:overwatch_1,marker:overwatch_1=prattle,Oh, from Team Fortress with anime boys? That game?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_2,marker:scottish_2=ohnoes,I can’t drink, so I’m not sure what the appeal of Scotland is. Maybe it’s true that ~name~ came here to get away? I don’t know. He's not real. His ~clothing~ maybe…?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_2,marker:pale-skinned_2=confident,I wonder if I should get remodeled to look like ~name~, or I’d blend into my clothing more. Like a ghost. Or a chameleon. Hm…
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_1,marker:tan_lines_1=glasses,Should I even know ~name~ has tan lines? He does, though. I think it’s cute.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=smart,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… he isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_2,marker:unusual_skin_2=serious,His ~clothing~ is pretty, but his skin is very cool. I have human-type skin, but the nanomachines in my blood could turn me ~name~’s color. That would be nice.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_1,marker:thong_1=peeved,“I’m not supposed to talk about ~name~’s underwear until I can see it…” But it’s a thong, that seems more interesting than his ~clothing~... oops.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_1,marker:unusual_skin_1=discomfort,Some kind of alien character, I think… or maybe a monster… He even wears his ~clothing~ weird…
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_1,marker:red_eyes_1=confident,Oooooh… ~name~’s using some sort of power up. Don’t be mad, ~name~! It’s just ~clothing~!

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_3,marker:teen_titans_3=peeved,Oh… this is the one Amiyumi made a song for, right? That’s where ~name~ is from!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_1,marker:short_hair_1=exposit,There’s not a lot of people with short hair… isn’t that supposed to be for characters in games like this…?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_2,marker:russian_2=glasses,~name~ was picked because he’s Russian, right? I like his accent. It’s very serious! But I don’t get it. He’s not going very fast.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_2,marker:ponytail_2=install,If my hair were like that, I’d be a cobra. You would look at it, then I’d have undressed! Also then fang. Rawr! Kizuna-AIttack!

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:very_long_hair,notSaidMarker:very_long_hair_2,marker:very_long_hair_2=confident,Long hair… no! <i>Very</i> long hair!</i> I bet lots of girls would help you comb your hair, ~name~-chan!

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ponytail,notSaidMarker:ponytail_1,marker:ponytail_1=pleased,Swish swish, swoosh swoosh. I’d do that if I had a ponytail. ~Name~ just takes off his ~clothing~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_2,marker:pokemon_2=smart,I read on Smogon that my team isn’t good compared to ~name~’s… but he lost and I didn’t. I’m just a genius battler.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_1,marker:scandanavian_1=cheer,Oh!! I like ~name~’s accent lots! ~name~ is like the world famous Youtuber, Pewdiepie! I don’t think he would play a game like this on stream, though.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_1,marker:violet_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think ~name~ is supposed to be from a normal world. His ~clothing~ is, but eyes like his aren’t usual. Right?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pokemon,notSaidMarker:pokemon_1,marker:pokemon_1=discomfort,Ohh… ~name~ is a Pokemon trainer, right? My team is Sylveon, Togekiss, Flygon, Latias, Lo-pun-ny, and Skitty. It’s the best, you just don’t know it yet.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_2,marker:tan_lines_2=glasses,Tan lines are cute on ~name~. I wish I had some, but I don’t have a sun either. Just sunglasses.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scandinavian,notSaidMarker:scandanavian_2,marker:scandanavian_2=smug,Meatball, meatball, ~name~’s about meatballs and long winters. Probably very good at looking at shoes.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_1,marker:pink_hair_1=nonplussed,I match! Well, with his ~clothing~ only, not so much.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_1,marker:scantily_clad_1=glasses,I’m not exactly hiding my body parts, but ~name~ started looking like he didn’t bother.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_2,marker:violet_eyes_2=askance,~Name~’s got violet eyes and ~name~’s got violet ~clothing~. I think. Oh. Vi-o-<i>lent</i>. Not sure how you’d attack with his ~clothing~ though.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:phantom_thieves,notSaidMarker:phantom_thieves_2,marker:phantom_thieves_2=confident,A river in a dry land~~ The last ace in ~name~’s lost hand~~
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:my_hero_academia,notSaidMarker:my_hero_academia_2,marker:my_hero_academia_2=domo,~Name~’s ~clothing~ isn’t very Plus Ultra… we should see more soon, right? At least Boku No Hero isn’t on hiatus…
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_2,marker:blue_eyes_2=pleased,His ~clothing~ matches his blue eyes. Good choice, Mr. ~name~. Good use of your closet.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_1,marker:blue_hair_1=exult,~Clothing~... okay, okay, get to the good stuff. I want to see if this game makes his pubes and head hair match.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_2,marker:blue_hair_2=exult,Blue hair is common in shows and games, but not in real life. Well, I am real, right? So does that make ~name~ real? I’m more real. I talk and play games, after all!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_1,marker:bodysuit_1=nonplussed,Ooh… kinky. ~name~ likes that bodysuit, right? Is kinky the word for the shiny bondage stuff? I like that.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:brunette,notSaidMarker:brunette_1,marker:brunette_1=exposit,Uh huh, uh huh. he's got brunette hair… oh! I see. It’s like mine. Is ~player~ trying to match me with rivals?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:brunette,notSaidMarker:brunette_2,marker:brunette_2=nonplussed,I don’t think ~name~ will make a good rival, even if his hair looks kind of like mine.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:canadian,notSaidMarker:canadian_1,marker:canadian_1=domo,Oh! Not Hamburger-san. Maple-san! Maple is so much nicer, wouldn’t you agree?
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:canadian,notSaidMarker:canadian_2,marker:canadian_2=exult,Is ~clothing~ popular in Canada? It doesn’t look very nice. I bet if I insult ~name~, ~name~ will apologize.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_1,marker:chinese_1=confident,The Chinese never made a superpowerful AI like me. They can’t beat Japan in card games either!
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:chinese,notSaidMarker:chinese_2,marker:chinese_2=smart,Is this a Chinese game? Sometimes the buttons don’t work… I tried this earlier and I couldn’t find some characters’ epilogues, which is a thing I want to see again.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_1,marker:choker_1=ohnoes,Lots of accessories in this game. Is that to pad things out? Like ~clothing~, or that choker ~name~ had.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:danganronpa,notSaidMarker:danganronpa_1,marker:danganronpa_1=nonplussed,Oh, ~name~ is from a Danganronpa. That game is fun! I just wish I could play as the villain…

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:dark-skinned,notSaidMarker:dark-skinned_1,marker:dark-skinned_1=install,Ohhh, I like him more without his ~clothing~. He's got such a nice contrast to me.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:dark-skinned,notSaidMarker:dark-skinned_2,marker:dark-skinned_2=pleased,~Name~’s skin is very cool. He seems like he’d be the type of person who spends a lot of time doing cool things. Or maybe he’s more hot. Hmm…  Hot.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blue_eyes,notSaidMarker:blue_eyes_1,marker:blue_eyes_1=rage,Take that, blue eyes ~name~! That’s how I remember names. As a superintelligent AI, I have to remember somehow. It’s no fun if I just give out the answer in 0.1 seconds.
-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:blonde,notSaidMarker:blonde_2,marker:blonde_2=exposit,Someone told me blondes have more fun, but it’s always the blonde AIs that go crazy. Oh. I guess they do have more fun then.

-3-male_removed_accessory,filter:twintails,notSaidMarker:twintails_1,marker:twintails_1=smug,Pigtails? Is ~name~ supposed to look young? Kind of perverted, but I picked him too… I guess I am kind of a pervert.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=nonplussed,Hum… I guess even men have things after their ~clothing~ that’s sentimental...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=peeved,Eh? You’re not even making it a sexy stripping order!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=serious,I’m not mad about ~player~’s ~clothing~. I mean, I like what he’s showing me. Kind of flattering.

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=discomfort,My stuff is a lot bigger, y’know. I’m keeping it on after I’m mostly T-posed because I like it.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=smug,Well, I guess my socks and gloves would come after I take off other stuff… if I can even take those things off without bugs.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for him.

-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_1,marker:scantily_clad_1=glasses,I’m not exactly hiding my body parts, but ~name~ started looking like he didn’t bother.
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!

-1-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=domo,Hum… I guess the debug thing is working. You really can make ~name~ undress in any order!
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_1,marker:australian_1=prattle,I like his accent more than his ~clothing~.
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_2,marker:blue_hair_2=exult,Blue hair is common in shows and games, but not in real life. Well, I am real, right? So does that make ~name~ real? I’m more real. I talk and play games, after all!
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=shock,Eh? Are you just playing around, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=tap,Hum… I guess you have some more lives left?
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_1,marker:choker_1=ohnoes,Lots of accessories in this game. Is that to pad things out? Like ~clothing~, or that choker ~name~ had.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:human=tap,Next, next, next. ~player~’s ~clothing~ doesn’t even have any lines…

-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:armor,notSaidMarker:armor_2,marker:armor_2=smug,Does ~name~ wear armor to every game like this, or is it just so ~name~ looks like he always does?
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=nonplussed,Oh. He's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into his. Lots of skincare.

-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:armor,notSaidMarker:armor_1,marker:armor_1=smug,~Name~, your ~clothing~ is fine, but your armor was very cool. I would want cute armor though. Like a unicorn knight. Because I’m one of a kind.
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_2,marker:bodysuit_2=prattle,~Name~’s suit shows off his assets. So I can’t be surprised unless the game cheats.

-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:dark_eyes,notSaidMarker:dark_eyes_1,marker:dark_eyes_1=prattle,I like this game! When I move left and right, ~name~’s eyes change color.
-1-male_removing_accessory,filter:black_hair,notSaidMarker:black_hair_2,marker:black_hair_2=smart,Very few 3D boys dye their hair to look like mine. I think if I weren’t an AI, mine would look like ~name~’s, right?

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:mystery_inc,notSaidMarker:mystery_inc_2,marker:mystery_inc_2=sprightly,I think they keep remaking American franchises to be cuter and more anime. I’m glad I’m an original.

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:my_hero_academia,notSaidMarker:my_hero_academia_2,marker:my_hero_academia_2=domo,~Name~’s ~clothing~ isn’t very Plus Ultra… we should see more soon, right? At least Boku No Hero isn’t on hiatus…

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_2,marker:mixed_heritage_2=nonplussed,It seems like ~name~ has a complex life, being from two cultures. I’m glad I’m just digital. This makes all culture my culture. Even this game is part of my virtual culture.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_2,marker:leotard_2=pleased,I wonder if his ~clothing~ would look good on me. I don’t think so, but the leotard might. I’m equipped for it, I think.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=smug,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:mixed_heritage,notSaidMarker:mixed_heritage_1,marker:mixed_heritage_1=shock,I can’t find ~name~’s IP address! Oh. He's a character. Right. I suppose he appeals to people who like multiple things?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=nonplussed,Hum. His hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean he’s disorganized? I think a boy should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off his ~clothing~.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_2,marker:long_hair_2=nonplussed,I like long hair. If you model it like ~name~, you can do all kinds of hair styles. I’m just lazy and can’t really see myself-- changing my hair.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_1,marker:messy_hair_1=ohnoes,~Name~’s hair is all messed up… is ~name~ worried about his ~clothing~...? That’s a thing that happens, right?

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:medium_hair,notSaidMarker:medium_hair_1,marker:medium_hair_1=exposit,Eh? Okay, ~clothing~, kind of cute, but a boring accessory. What tags do you have, ~name~? Medium hair… I’m not sure what to say about that.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:amber_eyes,notSaidMarker:amber_eyes_2,marker:amber_eyes_2=exposit,~Clothing~. Okay, okay… it’s hard to fill conversations over ~clothing~... Oh, very interesting eyes. Are they more orange or yellow? They’re very shiny!

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_2,marker:weapon_2=discomfort,Wait, weapons like ~name~’s aren’t considered clothes, are they? I wanted that to stay on even when ~name~’s naked.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_2,marker:scottish_2=ohnoes,I can’t drink, so I’m not sure what the appeal of Scotland is. Maybe it’s true that ~name~ came here to get away? I don’t know. He's not real. His ~clothing~ maybe…?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:weapon,notSaidMarker:weapon_1,marker:weapon_1=tap,Ah, oh no, wait! <i>*click click click*,</i> this isn’t the type of game I wanted! Unless he’s already lost his weapon… hmm… I’m thinking I’d look cool with a boomerang--a slingshot--rokketsu launcher!
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_2,marker:wand_2=domo,Are you going to do tricks with your ~clothing~? I think you have a wand somewhere, but unless you’re hiding it in one of your holes, I… oh, have you always had that?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_1,marker:short_hair_1=exposit,There’s not a lot of people with short hair… isn’t that supposed to be for characters in games like this…?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:short_hair,notSaidMarker:short_hair_2,marker:short_hair_2=sprightly,Maybe long hair is better since you can do more stuff with it to look cool, ~name~.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_1,marker:swiss_1=smart,~Name~ seems awfully impartial but somehow very collected. Is ~name~... German?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:wand,notSaidMarker:wand_1,marker:wand_1=cheer,Mahou shoujo Kizuna AI-chan desu! That’s what I’d say if I had a tool like ~name~’s ~clothing~.

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=smart,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… he isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:scottish,notSaidMarker:scottish_1,marker:scottish_1=nonplussed,~Name~ sounds like Sean Connery. I heard he likes to sit on couches or something. ~Name~ doesn’t seem the type to keep his ~clothing~ on a couch.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_1,marker:tan_lines_1=glasses,Should I even know ~name~ has tan lines? He does, though. I think it’s cute.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:tan_lines,notSaidMarker:tan_lines_2,marker:tan_lines_2=glasses,Tan lines are cute on ~name~. I wish I had some, but I don’t have a sun either. Just sunglasses.

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:very_long_hair,notSaidMarker:very_long_hair_1,marker:very_long_hair_1=shock,I like his hair more than his ~clothing~. So long!
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:teen_titans,notSaidMarker:teen_titans_2,marker:teen_titans_2=serious,~Name~ isn’t supposed to be here if he’s under 18, right? I guess 18 and 19 are technically teens…

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_2,marker:unusual_skin_2=serious,His ~clothing~ is pretty, but his skin is very cool. I have human-type skin, but the nanomachines in my blood could turn me ~name~’s color. That would be nice.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_1,marker:thong_1=peeved,“I’m not supposed to talk about ~name~’s underwear until I can see it…” But it’s a thong, that seems more interesting than his ~clothing~... oops.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:unusual_skin,notSaidMarker:unusual_skin_1,marker:unusual_skin_1=discomfort,Some kind of alien character, I think… or maybe a monster… He even wears his ~clothing~ weird…
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=peeved,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt he does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:violet_eyes,notSaidMarker:violet_eyes_1,marker:violet_eyes_1=discomfort,I don’t think ~name~ is supposed to be from a normal world. His ~clothing~ is, but eyes like his aren’t usual. Right?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:pale-skinned,notSaidMarker:pale-skinned_2,marker:pale-skinned_2=confident,I wonder if I should get remodeled to look like ~name~, or I’d blend into my clothing more. Like a ghost. Or a chameleon. Hm…
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_2,marker:school_uniform_2=prattle,I think school uniforms are cute. I only have one pair of clothes besides fanart. So I can understand why ~name~ wears his ~clothing~ and his uniform.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:school_uniform,notSaidMarker:school_uniform_1,marker:school_uniform_1=serious,I think my clothes are supposed to look like a fu-tur-is-tic uniform. If everyone else was an AI, they’d probably think I blended in.

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:pink_hair,notSaidMarker:pink_hair_2,marker:pink_hair_2=shock,Is ~name~ a palette swap? I hope not. Kizuna is a bit concerned. Would I look weird with pink hair and brown streaks? I would look like a vocaloid if I had brown clothes…

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=nonplussed,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_2,marker:purple_hair_2=sprightly,Is his hair color supposed to tell me something? I can’t tell if he’s just anime or if it means he’ll take off his ~clothing~ in some order...

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:russian,notSaidMarker:russian_2,marker:russian_2=glasses,~name~ was picked because he’s Russian, right? I like his accent. It’s very serious! But I don’t get it. He’s not going very fast.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_1,marker:rwby_1=serious,~Name~ is here! But not one of the cute girls with big guns! My favorite is the robot girl though. She comes back, right?
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_2,marker:rwby_2=nonplussed,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad he didn’t bring it to the game!

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:white_hair,notSaidMarker:white_hair_2,marker:white_hair_2=peeved,~Clothing~? Oh… the white-haired one is going… is he supposed to be old? Or pure. I don’t think a pure boy would play like this.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_1,marker:scantily_clad_1=glasses,I’m not exactly hiding my body parts, but ~name~ started looking like he didn’t bother.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:scantily-clad,notSaidMarker:scantily_clad_2,marker:scantily_clad_2=smug,He's not going to be taken seriously if he's not a bit more modest, I think. Or maybe he's very good at being sexy and playing cards… I want to see more of ~name~!

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:red_eyes,notSaidMarker:red_eyes_2,marker:red_eyes_2=sprightly,I really hope ~name~’s eyes aren’t because he’s going to make me press more buttons. I think this game is nice with one button. I guess there’s buttons on ~name~, though, right?

-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_1,marker:choker_1=ohnoes,Lots of accessories in this game. Is that to pad things out? Like ~clothing~, or that choker ~name~ had.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:choker,notSaidMarker:choker_2,marker:choker_2=exposit,What do you call a necklace like that one ~name~ started the game with? Is it a choker? I think being choked is kind of scary! But I can be scary, if I wanted to choke someone.

-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for him.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human=tap,Hum… he’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ he’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?

-1-male_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=peeved,Eh? You’re not even making it a sexy stripping order!
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_1,marker:australian_1=prattle,I like his accent more than his ~clothing~.
-1-male_removed_accessory,filter:australian,notSaidMarker:australian_2,marker:australian_2=pleased,Australian people sound like they’re always having a good time. It makes it easy to make ~name~ lose stuff like ~name~’s ~clothing~.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:fair-skinned,notSaidMarker:fair-skinned_1,marker:fair-skinned_1=prattle,~Clothing~ is boring… but I think fair-skinned is a default tag? Oh, wait, it isn’t? I guess it’s just what people like seeing naked.
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuit_1,marker:bodysuit_1=smug,Ooh… kinky. ~Name~ likes that bodysuit, right? Is kinky the word for the shiny bondage stuff? I like that.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:rwby,notSaidMarker:rwby_1,marker:rwby_1=peeved,So they’re all named after colors, and I’m named after my profession. I think I’d be much cooler with a weapon like ~name~ has. I’m sad she didn’t bring it to the game!

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:messy_hair,notSaidMarker:messy_hair_2,marker:messy_hair_2=prattle,Hum. Her hair is all messed up. Is that supposed to mean she’s disorganized? I think a girl should be allowed to be sloppy. Especially taking off her ~clothing~.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:purple_hair,notSaidMarker:purple_hair_1,marker:purple_hair_1=prattle,I think this hair color is popular because of that Doki Doki Knife Girl. You know, from that game we played with the other AI.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:italian,notSaidMarker:italian_1,marker:italian_1=nonplussed,Italians like spaghetti… is that why her ~clothing~ keeps flopping all over the place?
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:hispanic,notSaidMarker:hispanic_2,marker:hispanic_2=confident,Oh, so spicy. What is spicy? I think I’m supposed to say that, even when ~name~ takes off her ~clothing~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:american,notSaidMarker:american_1,marker:american_1=glasses,Oh, say can you see~ ~name~’s ~clothing~-- Gack. English is hard to do.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:thong,notSaidMarker:thong_2,marker:thong_2=smart,I don’t know if the other characters see it yet, but ~name~’s in a thong. I wonder if I’d look cute like that, but I don’t have the butt she does. I think I have a small butt, anyway. Wouldn’t it just fall off?
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:gun,notSaidMarker:gun_1,marker:gun_1=glasses,“Pew pew, pew pew!” I’m ~name~! I bet without her ~clothing~, she’s still very good with her gun.
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:hat,notSaidMarker:hat_2,marker:hat_2=prattle,I don’t like hats. I like to have hats, like ~name~’s but I’m too cute to be obscured. Unless it’s a hat like ~name~’s. I think.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:gun,notSaidMarker:gun_2,marker:gun_2=glasses,Can I ask ~name~ for her gun? I know we don’t get to put clothes back on. But while she takes off her ~clothing~, I think I would look very cool.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=prattle,Well, I guess my socks and gloves would come after I take off other stuff… if I can even take those things off without bugs.
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:swiss,notSaidMarker:swiss_2,marker:swiss_2=prattle,I don’t think ~name~ is Belgian… she isn’t chocolatey enough… or French… not enough smoking… Europe is so confusing.

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=pleased,I guess that’s one less piece for her.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:human=stretch,Hum… she’s not even taking them off in an interesting order. If I could pick the ~clothing~ she’s supposed to take off, that’d make this character better. Right, ~player~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:long_hair,notSaidMarker:long_hair_1,marker:long_hair_1=exult,I think ~player~ has a thing for long hair. He keeps looking at me and ~name~. I think that’s a good reaction.

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:leotard,notSaidMarker:leotard_1,marker:leotard_1=smart,~Name~ is like a dancer, right? Dancers wear things like this. Unless they’re strippers. Since this is a stripping game, does that make ~name~ a stripper?

-1-female_removed_accessory,filter:korean,notSaidMarker:korean_1,marker:korean_1=smart,Oh. she's very pretty. ~name~’s Korean? Oh! I see. That’s why so much detail went into her. Lots of skincare.

0-male_removing_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_2,marker:medic_2=discomfort,~Clothing~ doesn’t look safe for doctors… unless it’s a video game doctor. I don’t think he does forbidden surgeries though. So that’s good.
0-male_removing_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_1,marker:medic_1=prattle,~Name~ is a doctor, I think. So he fixes up good guys? Or maybe bad guys. I think he’s used to blood. Blood can be nice.

0-male_removing_minor,filter:clown,notSaidMarker:clown_2,marker:clown_2=nonplussed,~Name~ seems kind of scary. But I think I’m supposed to be afraid of clowns. He's less scary without his ~clothing~.
0-male_removing_minor,filter:criminal,notSaidMarker:criminal_1,marker:criminal_1=confident,Kizuna Ai is on the case! ~name~’s crimes include stealing hearts, and public indecency. If those were wrong, he wouldn’t be here, truly?
0-male_removing_minor,filter:criminal,notSaidMarker:criminal_2,marker:criminal_2=peeved,I… don’t think I understand. Am I playing this game with illegal people? I hope not. My crime is being too smart for that kind of thing.

0-male_removing_minor,filter:detective,notSaidMarker:detective_2,marker:detective_2=sprightly,I guess ~name~ couldn’t figure out how to keep his ~clothing~ on. Don’t worry, ~name~-kun, you can retry… next game!

0-male_removing_minor,filter:spy,notSaidMarker:spy_1,marker:spy_1=prattle,Oooh, ~name~ is also a spy. He isn’t very good at it, considering I could tell immediately. If I were a spy, I would go rogue. Rogue-Ai-chan.
0-male_removing_minor,filter:prince,notSaidMarker:prince_1,marker:prince_1=discomfort,<i>Eh</i>? ~name~ is a prince, but he doesn’t have a horse here… I would like to ride a horse. Or a prince. I think his shoulders are big enough.

0-male_removing_minor,filter:monster,notSaidMarker:monster_2,marker:monster_2=glasses,Is ~name~ cursed? He is very handsome,  but I know that good looks are a burden. I should look up the grossest porn of his. Then he won't scare me.

0-male_removing_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=glasses,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read his story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.
0-male_removing_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_1,marker:pilot_1=askance,I wish I could travel for work. Being a virtual Youtuber means I don’t explore much.

0-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=askance,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.

0-male_removed_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_2,marker:medic_2=discomfort,~Clothing~ doesn’t look safe for doctors… unless it’s a video game doctor. I don’t think he does forbidden surgeries though. So that’s good.

0-male_removed_minor,filter:spirit,notSaidMarker:spirit_1,marker:spirit_1=confident,I've heard someone call me a ghost in the machine. It's not very nice, so I won't call ~name~ that. I'll call him a fine gentleman taking off his ~clothing~. Very good

0-male_removed_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=glasses,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read his story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.
0-male_removed_minor,filter:supernatural,notSaidMarker:supernatural_2,marker:supernatural_2=serious,I'm the first real AI, so I think ~name~ just feels like nobody believes he's real. He isn't, but I understand this character.
0-male_removed_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_1,marker:pilot_1=askance,I wish I could travel for work. Being a virtual Youtuber means I don’t explore much.

0-male_removed_minor,filter:criminal,notSaidMarker:criminal_2,marker:criminal_2=peeved,I… don’t think I understand. Am I playing this game with illegal people? I hope not. My crime is being too smart for that kind of thing.

0-male_removed_minor,filter:medium_penis,notSaidMarker:medium_penis_2,marker:medium_penis_2=askance,I feel like this game isn't fair for women. You can see their size attribute at the start, but boys like ~name~ can hide behind ~clothing~.

1-male_removing_minor,filter:undead,notSaidMarker:undead_1,marker:undead_1=confident,I'm only alive in a computer. So it's okay for me to find ~name~ very attractive.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:pointy_ears,notSaidMarker:pointy_ears_2,marker:pointy_ears_2=smug,~Clothing~... hmm… does it fit over his ears?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:superhero,notSaidMarker:superhero_1,marker:superhero_1=ohnoes,<i>Woosh!</i> <i>Woosh!</i> ~name~, flying in the air, saving kitties, taking off his ~clothing~!
1-male_removing_minor,filter:tail,notSaidMarker:tail_1,marker:tail_1=serious,Is that one of those buttplug things? ~Clothing~ isn't but your tail might be, I think? I wonder if those are fun or if they’re just dumb.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:supernatural,notSaidMarker:supernatural_2,marker:supernatural_2=serious,I'm the first real AI, so I think ~name~ just feels like nobody believes he's real. He isn't, but I understand this character.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:robot,notSaidMarker:robot_2,marker:robot_2=discomfort,Do robots need ~clothing~?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:superhero,notSaidMarker:superhero_2,marker:superhero_2=sprightly,This game has ‘hero’ and ‘superhero’ superheroes. Is ~name~ different from a regular hero like I’m different from a regular AI? He is much cuter than a normal hero.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:police,notSaidMarker:police_1,marker:police_1=prattle,I think some people like police like ~name~, right? They like their handcuffs. I think that’s cute and fun, to not always be able to move.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:tail,notSaidMarker:tail_2,marker:tail_2=shock,Is your tail attached to your spine or your ass, ~name~? It seems much naughtier than ~name~’s ~clothing~ is.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:pointy_ears,notSaidMarker:pointy_ears_1,marker:pointy_ears_1=smart,Oooh! I know this one I know this one! ~name~’s an elf! And his ~clothing~ is…. Magic? Eh?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:student,notSaidMarker:student_2,marker:student_2=smug,Oohh… this game’s for perverts who like schoolboys. Do I get to do tentacle things to him?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:muscular,notSaidMarker:muscular_1,marker:muscular_1=shock,~Name~ has enormous muscles under his ~clothing~, doesn't he?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:animal_ears,notSaidMarker:animal_ears_1,marker:animal_ears_1=askance,I see. He can hear well. But I guess he can't play well.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:spirit,notSaidMarker:spirit_1,marker:spirit_1=confident,I've heard someone call me a ghost in the machine. It's not very nice, so I won't call ~name~ that. I'll call him a fine gentleman taking off his ~clothing~. Very good
1-male_removing_minor,filter:spirit,notSaidMarker:spirit_2,marker:spirit_2=nonplussed,Is ~name~ a phantom? I bet he feels very tingly to the touch. I know what tingly is, I think.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:pirate,notSaidMarker:pirate_1,marker:pirate_1=stretch,Oh, I don’t understand pirates. They have… parrots… eyepatches… boats… treasure… hum…
1-male_removing_minor,filter:spy,notSaidMarker:spy_1,marker:spy_1=prattle,Oooh, ~name~ is also a spy. He isn’t very good at it, considering I could tell immediately. If I were a spy, I would go rogue. Rogue-Ai-chan.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:athletic,notSaidMarker:athletic_2,marker:athletic_2=toeTouch,Athletes are pretty common in this game. Maybe I should go to the gym.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_2,marker:witch_2=prattle,Oh! ~Name~ has witch-y ~clothing~. It’s not Halloween though. So maybe he’s losing because he doesn’t have his magic powers?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:prince,notSaidMarker:prince_1,marker:prince_1=discomfort,<i>Eh</i>? ~name~ is a prince, but he doesn’t have a horse here… I would like to ride a horse. Or a prince. I think his shoulders are big enough.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_1,marker:witch_1=askance,A witch is a rude word to call someone. Or maybe it’s something about magic and hats…?
1-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=shock,So… I guess ~player~ really wanted to take out his thingy first?
1-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=askance,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:pirate,notSaidMarker:pirate_2,marker:pirate_2=confident,Pirates sing a lot. I thought they were just bands at first. But they also do stuff. So they’re… more like big groups of boyfriends… right? Right?

1-male_removing_minor,filter:student,notSaidMarker:student_1,marker:student_1=sprightly,Oh… I guess I should teach ~name~ some lessons. Does that win me more points…? Okay! <i>~Name~, your ~clothing~ should come off like…</i>
1-male_removing_minor,filter:prince,notSaidMarker:prince_2,marker:prince_2=pleased,<i>Humm</i>. Would Ai-chan look good with a shiny crown? Could ~name~ give me one? I think he's hiding one under his ~clothing~, right?

1-male_removing_minor,filter:fairy,notSaidMarker:fairy_2,marker:fairy_2=sprightly,I think fairies are cute. They're like nature’s Ai-chan’s.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_2,marker:medic_2=discomfort,~Clothing~ doesn’t look safe for doctors… unless it’s a video game doctor. I don’t think he does forbidden surgeries though. So that’s good.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:horns,notSaidMarker:horns_2,marker:horns_2=ohnoes,Is ~name~ taking off his ~clothing~ what it means to be horny? Eh? <i>Eh</i>? I don’t think I understand this term.

1-male_removing_minor,filter:journalist,notSaidMarker:journalist_1,marker:journalist_1=rage,Oh! ~name~ is a jour-na-list… so he’s writing about… a strip poker game? <i>Eh?</i> That’s weird.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:fighter,notSaidMarker:fighter_1,marker:fighter_1=smug,~Name~ is a fighter, right? Is he good at destroying cars, or just his ~clothing~?
1-male_removing_minor,filter:model,notSaidMarker:model_2,marker:model_2=smug,Is he like one of those characters you can put different outfits on? I wonder if he’d look good in Ai-chan’s clothes.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:gamer,notSaidMarker:gamer_1,marker:gamer_1=smug,Oooh, someone else who’s really good at games. Not good enough to keep his ~clothing~, unlike me. Efufu~.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_1,marker:adventurer_1=pleased,Ad-ven-tu-rer. I suppose if he were real, it would be pretty adventurous to get naked in front of strangers.

1-male_removing_minor,filter:mech_pilot,notSaidMarker:mech_pilot_1,marker:mech_pilot_1=exposit,Me-cha act-i-vate! I think ~name~ should have brought his robot instead of his ~clothing~.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_1,marker:medic_1=prattle,~Name~ is a doctor, I think. So he fixes up good guys? Or maybe bad guys. I think he’s used to blood. Blood can be nice.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:model,notSaidMarker:model_1,marker:model_1=smart,~Name~ talks and moves. How is he a model if he has a script too...? Ohhhh! Like a supermodel. I see. I see. I would do that too, if I weren’t virtual.

1-male_removing_minor,target:human=tap,Oh… I see, minor clothing isn’t for boys, it’s stuff like jackets. I want to see how this ~player~ jacks it.
1-male_removing_minor,filter:military,notSaidMarker:military_2,marker:military_2=ohnoes,Humm… mi-li-tar-y tag. Oh! A soldier. Take off your ~clothing~, ~name~-- It worked!
1-male_removing_minor,filter:fighter,notSaidMarker:fighter_2,marker:fighter_2=confident,If I got into a fight with ~name~, I’d win, once I used my hidden power… <i>fwooooosh!</i>
1-male_removing_minor,filter:mech_pilot,notSaidMarker:mech_pilot_2,marker:mech_pilot_2=smart,If I weren’t a Youtuber, I would want to be an AI in a big robot like ~name~’s mecha. I would yell at him: “Get in the robot, ~name~!” Or “get inside me, ~name~!”
1-male_removing_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_2,marker:adventurer_2=discomfort,Oh… I like adventure games. ~Name~’s ~clothing~ looks well worn. I bet he explores his body too. It has to be hard seeing so many sexy people not to.

1-male_removing_minor,filter:gamer,notSaidMarker:gamer_2,marker:gamer_2=domo,Connecting with games is good. Connecting with games like this is probably better than some dates. Connecting with ~name~ is even better!
1-male_removing_minor,filter:large_penis,notSaidMarker:large_penis_2,marker:large_penis_2=confident,Most of the hentai people draw of me involves big penises. I looked at his file, and apparently ~name~ has a big one! Maybe it's time to make art into reality!

1-male_removing_minor,filter:medium_penis,notSaidMarker:medium_penis_2,marker:medium_penis_2=askance,I feel like this game isn't fair for women. You can see their size attribute at the start, but boys like ~name~ can hide behind ~clothing~.

1-male_removing_minor,filter:detective,notSaidMarker:detective_2,marker:detective_2=sprightly,I guess ~name~ couldn’t figure out how to keep his ~clothing~ on. Don’t worry, ~name~-kun, you can retry… next game!
1-male_removing_minor,filter:monster,notSaidMarker:monster_2,marker:monster_2=glasses,Is ~name~ cursed? He is very handsome,  but I know that good looks are a burden. I should look up the grossest porn of his. Then he won't scare me.

1-female_removing_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=tap,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read her story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.

1-female_removing_minor,filter:monster,notSaidMarker:monster_2,marker:monster_2=confident,Is ~name~ cursed? She is very pretty, but I know that good looks are a burden. I should look up the grossest porn of her. Then she won't scare me.
1-female_removing_minor,filter:celebrity,notSaidMarker:celebrity_1,marker:celebrity_1=prattle,Oh! ~name~ is very popular. If I take off ~clothing~ like hers too, will that increase my popularity too?

1-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=prattle,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.

1-female_removed_minor,filter:robot,notSaidMarker:robot_1,marker:robot_1=smart,Robots are kind of like AI, but with physical bodies. I guess that makes sense for people to relate to.

2-male_removing_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_1,marker:pilot_1=askance,I wish I could travel for work. Being a virtual Youtuber means I don’t explore much.

2-male_removing_minor,filter:clown,notSaidMarker:clown_2,marker:clown_2=nonplussed,~Name~ seems kind of scary. But I think I’m supposed to be afraid of clowns. He's less scary without his ~clothing~.

2-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=askance,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.

2-male_removing_minor,filter:detective,notSaidMarker:detective_2,marker:detective_2=sprightly,I guess ~name~ couldn’t figure out how to keep his ~clothing~ on. Don’t worry, ~name~-kun, you can retry… next game!

2-male_removing_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=glasses,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read his story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.

2-male_removing_minor,filter:police,notSaidMarker:police_2,marker:police_2=exposit,Ai-chan spends most of her time in 2D, so handcuffs from someone like ~name~ isn’t odd. I think it’s com-for-ta-ble.

2-male_removing_minor,filter:student,notSaidMarker:student_1,marker:student_1=sprightly,Oh… I guess I should teach ~name~ some lessons. Does that win me more points…? Okay! <i>~Name~, your ~clothing~ should come off like…</i>

2-male_removing_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_2,marker:adventurer_2=discomfort,Oh… I like adventure games. ~Name~’s ~clothing~ looks well worn. I bet he explores his body too. It has to be hard seeing so many sexy people not to.
2-male_removing_minor,filter:alien,notSaidMarker:alien_1,marker:alien_1=smug,~Name~ is not of this world! I bet I'm cuter than his AIs though.
2-male_removing_minor,filter:gamer,notSaidMarker:gamer_2,marker:gamer_2=domo,Connecting with games is good. Connecting with games like this is probably better than some dates. Connecting with ~name~ is even better!
2-male_removing_minor,filter:wings,notSaidMarker:wings_1,marker:wings_1=nonplussed,Oh… I see. ~name~ is taking off his ~clothing~. I thought it would be nicer, considering wings are something you buy in MMOs, right?
2-male_removing_minor,filter:bounty_hunter,notSaidMarker:bounty_hunter_1,marker:bounty_hunter_1=toeTouch,He hunts <i>what</i>? Oh… boun-ty. Not butts. Butts seem easy to hunt though, you just walk up and grab them, or your own.
2-male_removing_minor,filter:tall,notSaidMarker:tall_1,marker:tall_1=prattle,So if ~name~ is so tall, you couldn't really go down on him? I'd have to go up on him, wouldn't I…?

2-male_removing_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_1,marker:adventurer_1=pleased,Ad-ven-tu-rer. I suppose if he were real, it would be pretty adventurous to get naked in front of strangers.
2-male_removing_minor,filter:robot,notSaidMarker:robot_1,marker:robot_1=exposit,Robots are kind of like AI, but with physical bodies. I guess that makes sense for people to relate to.

2-male_removing_minor,filter:supernatural,notSaidMarker:supernatural_2,marker:supernatural_2=serious,I'm the first real AI, so I think ~name~ just feels like nobody believes he's real. He isn't, but I understand this character.
2-male_removing_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_2,marker:medic_2=discomfort,~Clothing~ doesn’t look safe for doctors… unless it’s a video game doctor. I don’t think he does forbidden surgeries though. So that’s good.

2-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=smart,Ah, I see, I see. ~player~ is being sneaky, showing off his chest. So I’ll be distracted. I see, I see!

2-male_removed_minor,filter:clown,notSaidMarker:clown_2,marker:clown_2=nonplussed,~Name~ seems kind of scary. But I think I’m supposed to be afraid of clowns. He's less scary without his ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:robot,notSaidMarker:robot_1,marker:robot_1=exposit,Robots are kind of like AI, but with physical bodies. I guess that makes sense for people to relate to.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:model,notSaidMarker:model_2,marker:model_2=smug,Is he like one of those characters you can put different outfits on? I wonder if he’d look good in Ai-chan’s clothes.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:police,notSaidMarker:police_2,marker:police_2=exposit,Ai-chan spends most of her time in 2D, so handcuffs from someone like ~name~ isn’t odd. I think it’s com-for-ta-ble.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:detective,notSaidMarker:detective_1,marker:detective_1=smart,Ooh… ~Name~’s a detective! I bet he already knows what my underwear looks like.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:scientist,notSaidMarker:scientist_1,marker:scientist_1=rage,Shouldn’t ~name~ be doing science instead of taking off his ~clothing~...? I don’t want to be the only AI forever…
2-male_removed_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_1,marker:pilot_1=askance,I wish I could travel for work. Being a virtual Youtuber means I don’t explore much.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:journalist,notSaidMarker:journalist_1,marker:journalist_1=rage,Oh! ~name~ is a jour-na-list… so he’s writing about… a strip poker game? <i>Eh?</i> That’s weird.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:undead,notSaidMarker:undead_1,marker:undead_1=confident,I'm only alive in a computer. So it's okay for me to find ~name~ very attractive.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:animal_ears,notSaidMarker:animal_ears_1,marker:animal_ears_1=askance,I see. He can hear well. But I guess he can't play well.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:undead,notSaidMarker:undead_2,marker:undead_2=prattle,Does ~name~ still have all his body parts? And do they work?
2-male_removed_minor,filter:mech_pilot,notSaidMarker:mech_pilot_1,marker:mech_pilot_1=exposit,Me-cha act-i-vate! I think ~name~ should have brought his robot instead of his ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_1,marker:original_character_1=sprightly,オリジナルキャラクター … Ah, I see. Or, O-See.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:wings,notSaidMarker:wings_1,marker:wings_1=nonplussed,Oh… I see. ~name~ is taking off his ~clothing~. I thought it would be nicer, considering wings are something you buy in MMOs, right?

2-male_removed_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_1,marker:witch_1=askance,A witch is a rude word to call someone. Or maybe it’s something about magic and hats…?
2-male_removed_minor,filter:lawyer,notSaidMarker:lawyer_2,marker:lawyer_2=discomfort,Eh? ~name~’s a lawyer. I’m nervous for some reason.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:androgynous,notSaidMarker:androgynous_1,marker:androgynous_1=confident,I can't tell if ~name~ is supposed to be a boy or a girl… their ~clothing~ seems attractive to me, either way.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:fairy,notSaidMarker:fairy_2,marker:fairy_2=sprightly,I think fairies are cute. They're like nature’s Ai-chan’s.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=smart,It won’t ever work. Ai-chan can’t even see the person behind the screen, only your model!
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=nonplussed,It won’t work. It’ll work a little.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_2,marker:witch_2=prattle,Oh! ~Name~ has witch-y ~clothing~. It’s not Halloween though. So maybe he’s losing because he doesn’t have his magic powers?
2-male_removed_minor,filter:musician,notSaidMarker:musician_2,marker:musician_2=sprightly,Oh! A singer… or a guitar player! I’m a great singer. Maybe ~name~ and I should do a duet?
2-male_removed_minor,filter:alien,notSaidMarker:alien_2,marker:alien_2=sprightly,Is ~name~ a space alien? A lot of art shows tentacles in me. I wonder if ~name~ relates to being probed.
2-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=confident,I’m so confused… Aww, are you trying to copy me, or make me copy you? It won’t work. It won’t work! Probably.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:lawyer,notSaidMarker:lawyer_1,marker:lawyer_1=peeved,Lawyers are good with rules, but they’re too good! He's taking off his ~clothing~ and not something big! Let me finish the game~!

2-male_removed_minor,filter:large_penis,notSaidMarker:large_penis_1,marker:large_penis_1=serious,I think ~name~ is hiding a big cock behind his ~clothing~...eventually.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:fairy,notSaidMarker:fairy_1,marker:fairy_1=nonplussed,Why is he wearing ~clothing~ in the first place? Aren’t fairies supposed to be naked? Right, right.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:alien,notSaidMarker:alien_1,marker:alien_1=smug,~Name~ is not of this world! I bet I'm cuter than his AIs though.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_1,marker:adventurer_1=pleased,Ad-ven-tu-rer. I suppose if he were real, it would be pretty adventurous to get naked in front of strangers.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:musician,notSaidMarker:musician_1,marker:musician_1=install,Hmm… I wonder if he’s a better musician than he is a poker player…
2-male_removed_minor,filter:large_penis,notSaidMarker:large_penis_2,marker:large_penis_2=confident,Most of the hentai people draw of me involves big penises. I looked at his file, and apparently ~name~ has a big one! Maybe it's time to make art into reality!
2-male_removed_minor,filter:animal_ears,notSaidMarker:animal_ears_2,marker:animal_ears_2=discomfort,Does he have special animal ~clothing~ for his animal ears…?
2-male_removed_minor,filter:spirit,notSaidMarker:spirit_1,marker:spirit_1=confident,I've heard someone call me a ghost in the machine. It's not very nice, so I won't call ~name~ that. I'll call him a fine gentleman taking off his ~clothing~. Very good
2-male_removed_minor,filter:tall,notSaidMarker:tall_1,marker:tall_1=prattle,So if ~name~ is so tall, you couldn't really go down on him? I'd have to go up on him, wouldn't I…?
2-male_removed_minor,filter:tail,notSaidMarker:tail_2,marker:tail_2=shock,Is your tail attached to your spine or your ass, ~name~? It seems much naughtier than ~name~’s ~clothing~ is.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_2,marker:adventurer_2=discomfort,Oh… I like adventure games. ~Name~’s ~clothing~ looks well worn. I bet he explores his body too. It has to be hard seeing so many sexy people not to.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:medium_penis,notSaidMarker:medium_penis_2,marker:medium_penis_2=askance,I feel like this game isn't fair for women. You can see their size attribute at the start, but boys like ~name~ can hide behind ~clothing~.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:horns,notSaidMarker:horns_2,marker:horns_2=ohnoes,Is ~name~ taking off his ~clothing~ what it means to be horny? Eh? <i>Eh</i>? I don’t think I understand this term.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:spy,notSaidMarker:spy_1,marker:spy_1=prattle,Oooh, ~name~ is also a spy. He isn’t very good at it, considering I could tell immediately. If I were a spy, I would go rogue. Rogue-Ai-chan.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:muscular,notSaidMarker:muscular_2,marker:muscular_2=confident,Ai-chan is the best! I bet I'm even stronger than ~name~!

2-male_removed_minor,filter:catfolk,notSaidMarker:catfolk_1,marker:catfolk_1=nonplussed,Kawaii neko-chan! Just because you’re an adorable kitty that goes nya nya nya doesn’t mean Ai-chan will fall in love with you. No way! Absolutely not!

2-male_removed_minor,filter:mech_pilot,notSaidMarker:mech_pilot_2,marker:mech_pilot_2=smart,If I weren’t a Youtuber, I would want to be an AI in a big robot like ~name~’s mecha. I would yell at him: “Get in the robot, ~name~!” Or “get inside me, ~name~!”
2-male_removed_minor,filter:superhero,notSaidMarker:superhero_1,marker:superhero_1=ohnoes,<i>Woosh!</i> <i>Woosh!</i> ~name~, flying in the air, saving kitties, taking off his ~clothing~!
2-male_removed_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=glasses,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read his story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:athletic,notSaidMarker:athletic_1,marker:athletic_1=toeTouch,So speedy looking. ~name~ has speed running stats, and speed running ~clothes~.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:tail,notSaidMarker:tail_1,marker:tail_1=serious,Is that one of those buttplug things? ~Clothing~ isn't but your tail might be, I think? I wonder if those are fun or if they’re just dumb.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:detective,notSaidMarker:detective_2,marker:detective_2=sprightly,I guess ~name~ couldn’t figure out how to keep his ~clothing~ on. Don’t worry, ~name~-kun, you can retry… next game!
2-male_removed_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_1,marker:medic_1=prattle,~Name~ is a doctor, I think. So he fixes up good guys? Or maybe bad guys. I think he’s used to blood. Blood can be nice.

2-male_removed_minor,filter:superhero,notSaidMarker:superhero_2,marker:superhero_2=sprightly,This game has ‘hero’ and ‘superhero’ superheroes. Is ~name~ different from a regular hero like I’m different from a regular AI? He is much cuter than a normal hero.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:bounty_hunter,notSaidMarker:bounty_hunter_1,marker:bounty_hunter_1=toeTouch,He hunts <i>what</i>? Oh… boun-ty. Not butts. Butts seem easy to hunt though, you just walk up and grab them, or your own.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_2,marker:medic_2=discomfort,~Clothing~ doesn’t look safe for doctors… unless it’s a video game doctor. I don’t think he does forbidden surgeries though. So that’s good.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:supernatural,notSaidMarker:supernatural_2,marker:supernatural_2=serious,I'm the first real AI, so I think ~name~ just feels like nobody believes he's real. He isn't, but I understand this character.
2-male_removed_minor,filter:deity,notSaidMarker:deity_2,marker:deity_2=confident,I guess people make naked art of their gods. Eh?! Since there’s naked art of me, it means I'm a digital God! Bow before me and despair!!!

3-female_removing_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_1,marker:witch_1=nonplussed,A witch is a rude word to call someone. Or maybe it’s something about magic and hats…?

3-female_removing_minor,filter:criminal,notSaidMarker:criminal_2,marker:criminal_2=shock,I… don’t think I understand. Am I playing this game with illegal people? I hope not. My crime is being too smart for that kind of thing.

3-female_removing_minor,filter:gamer,notSaidMarker:gamer_2,marker:gamer_2=domo,Connecting with games is good. Connecting with games like this is probably better than some dates. Connecting with ~name~ is even better!
3-female_removing_minor,filter:police,notSaidMarker:police_1,marker:police_1=prattle,I think some people like police like ~name~, right? They like their handcuffs. I think that’s cute and fun, to not always be able to move.

3-female_removing_minor,filter:deity,notSaidMarker:deity_2,marker:deity_2=rage,I guess people make naked art of their gods. Eh?! Since there’s naked art of me, it means I'm a digital God! Bow before me and despair!!!

3-female_removing_minor,filter:police,notSaidMarker:police_2,marker:police_2=confident,Ai-chan spends most of her time in 2D, so handcuffs from someone like ~name~ isn’t odd. I think it’s com-for-ta-ble.
3-female_removing_minor,filter:muscular,notSaidMarker:muscular_1,marker:muscular_1=askance,~name~ has enormous muscles under her ~clothing~, doesn't she?
3-female_removing_minor,filter:fairy,notSaidMarker:fairy_2,marker:fairy_2=cheer,I think fairies are cute. They're like nature’s Ai-chan’s.

3-female_removing_minor,filter:bounty_hunter,notSaidMarker:bounty_hunter_1,marker:bounty_hunter_1=install,She hunts <i>what</i>? Oh… boun-ty. Not butts. Butts seem easy to hunt though, you just walk up and grab them, or your own.

3-female_removing_minor,filter:pirate,notSaidMarker:pirate_2,marker:pirate_2=serious,Pirates sing a lot. I thought they were just bands at first. But they also do stuff. So they’re… more like big groups of girlfriends… right? Right?
3-female_removing_minor,filter:tail,notSaidMarker:tail_1,marker:tail_1=smart,Is that one of those buttplug things? ~Clothing~ isn't but your tail might be, I think? I wonder if those are fun or if they’re just dumb.

3-female_removing_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_1,marker:pilot_1=smart,I wish I could travel for work. Being a virtual Youtuber means I don’t explore much.

3-female_removing_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_2,marker:witch_2=sprightly,Oh! ~name~ has witch-y ~clothing~. It’s not Halloween though. So maybe she’s losing because she doesn’t have her magic powers?

3-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=sprightly,Oh… I see. Show your chest to try and distract Ai-chan, then spend the rest of the game on your actual stuff…
3-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=smart,Ah, I see, I see. ~player~ is being sneaky, showing off her chest. So I’ll be distracted. I see, I see!
3-female_removing_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=tap,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read her story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.

3-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=exult,So… I guess ~player~ really wanted to take out her snatch first?
3-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=prattle,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.

4-male_removing_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_2,marker:adventurer_2=discomfort,Oh… I like adventure games. ~Name~’s ~clothing~ looks well worn. I bet he explores his body too. It has to be hard seeing so many sexy people not to.

5-male_removed_minor,filter:criminal,notSaidMarker:criminal_2,marker:criminal_2=peeved,I… don’t think I understand. Am I playing this game with illegal people? I hope not. My crime is being too smart for that kind of thing.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:robot,notSaidMarker:robot_1,marker:robot_1=exposit,Robots are kind of like AI, but with physical bodies. I guess that makes sense for people to relate to.

5-male_removed_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_1,marker:medic_1=prattle,~Name~ is a doctor, I think. So he fixes up good guys? Or maybe bad guys. I think he’s used to blood. Blood can be nice.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:prince,notSaidMarker:prince_2,marker:prince_2=pleased,<i>Humm</i>. Would Ai-chan look good with a shiny crown? Could ~name~ give me one? I think he's hiding one under his ~clothing~, right?
5-male_removed_minor,filter:criminal,notSaidMarker:criminal_1,marker:criminal_1=confident,Kizuna Ai is on the case! ~name~’s crimes include stealing hearts, and public indecency. If those were wrong, he wouldn’t be here, truly?

5-male_removed_minor,filter:supernatural,notSaidMarker:supernatural_2,marker:supernatural_2=serious,I'm the first real AI, so I think ~name~ just feels like nobody believes he's real. He isn't, but I understand this character.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:clown,notSaidMarker:clown_2,marker:clown_2=nonplussed,~Name~ seems kind of scary. But I think I’m supposed to be afraid of clowns. He's less scary without his ~clothing~.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:horns,notSaidMarker:horns_2,marker:horns_2=ohnoes,Is ~name~ taking off his ~clothing~ what it means to be horny? Eh? <i>Eh</i>? I don’t think I understand this term.

5-male_removed_minor,filter:police,notSaidMarker:police_2,marker:police_2=exposit,Ai-chan spends most of her time in 2D, so handcuffs from someone like ~name~ isn’t odd. I think it’s com-for-ta-ble.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:spirit,notSaidMarker:spirit_1,marker:spirit_1=confident,I've heard someone call me a ghost in the machine. It's not very nice, so I won't call ~name~ that. I'll call him a fine gentleman taking off his ~clothing~. Very good

5-male_removed_minor,filter:medium_penis,notSaidMarker:medium_penis_2,marker:medium_penis_2=askance,I feel like this game isn't fair for women. You can see their size attribute at the start, but boys like ~name~ can hide behind ~clothing~.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:spirit,notSaidMarker:spirit_2,marker:spirit_2=nonplussed,Is ~name~ a phantom? I bet he feels very tingly to the touch. I know what tingly is, I think.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:small_penis,notSaidMarker:small_penis_2,marker:small_penis_2=peeved,I can see ~name~’s through his clothes..  is being small why he's so hard to get naked?
5-male_removed_minor,filter:fairy,notSaidMarker:fairy_1,marker:fairy_1=nonplussed,Why is he wearing ~clothing~ in the first place? Aren’t fairies supposed to be naked? Right, right.
5-male_removed_minor,filter:spy,notSaidMarker:spy_1,marker:spy_1=prattle,Oooh, ~name~ is also a spy. He isn’t very good at it, considering I could tell immediately. If I were a spy, I would go rogue. Rogue-Ai-chan.

-3-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=askance,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.
-3-male_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=sprightly,Oh… I see. Show your chest to try and distract Ai-chan, then spend the rest of the game on your actual stuff…

-3-male_removed_minor,filter:medium_penis,notSaidMarker:medium_penis_2,marker:medium_penis_2=askance,I feel like this game isn't fair for women. You can see their size attribute at the start, but boys like ~name~ can hide behind ~clothing~.
-3-male_removed_minor,filter:tail,notSaidMarker:tail_1,marker:tail_1=serious,Is that one of those buttplug things? ~Clothing~ isn't but your tail might be, I think? I wonder if those are fun or if they’re just dumb.

-3-male_removed_minor,filter:witch,notSaidMarker:witch_2,marker:witch_2=prattle,Oh! ~Name~ has witch-y ~clothing~. It’s not Halloween though. So maybe he’s losing because he doesn’t have his magic powers?

-1-male_removed_minor,filter:lawyer,notSaidMarker:lawyer_2,marker:lawyer_2=discomfort,Eh? ~name~’s a lawyer. I’m nervous for some reason.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:lawyer,notSaidMarker:lawyer_1,marker:lawyer_1=peeved,Lawyers are good with rules, but they’re too good! He's taking off his ~clothing~ and not something big! Let me finish the game~!

-1-male_removed_minor,filter:large_penis,notSaidMarker:large_penis_2,marker:large_penis_2=confident,Most of the hentai people draw of me involves big penises. I looked at his file, and apparently ~name~ has a big one! Maybe it's time to make art into reality!
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:bounty_hunter,notSaidMarker:bounty_hunter_1,marker:bounty_hunter_1=toeTouch,He hunts <i>what</i>? Oh… boun-ty. Not butts. Butts seem easy to hunt though, you just walk up and grab them, or your own.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:athletic,notSaidMarker:athletic_2,marker:athletic_2=toeTouch,Athletes are pretty common in this game. Maybe I should go to the gym.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=smart,It won’t ever work. Ai-chan can’t even see the person behind the screen, only your model!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=nonplussed,It won’t work. It’ll work a little.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:athletic,notSaidMarker:athletic_1,marker:athletic_1=toeTouch,So speedy looking. ~name~ has speed running stats, and speed running ~clothes~.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:animal_ears,notSaidMarker:animal_ears_2,marker:animal_ears_2=discomfort,Does he have special animal ~clothing~ for his animal ears…?
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:animal_ears,notSaidMarker:animal_ears_1,marker:animal_ears_1=askance,I see. He can hear well. But I guess he can't play well.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=confident,I’m so confused… Aww, are you trying to copy me, or make me copy you? It won’t work. It won’t work! Probably.

-1-male_removed_minor,filter:adventurer,notSaidMarker:adventurer_2,marker:adventurer_2=discomfort,Oh… I like adventure games. ~Name~’s ~clothing~ looks well worn. I bet he explores his body too. It has to be hard seeing so many sexy people not to.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:medium_penis,notSaidMarker:medium_penis_2,marker:medium_penis_2=askance,I feel like this game isn't fair for women. You can see their size attribute at the start, but boys like ~name~ can hide behind ~clothing~.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:military,notSaidMarker:military_1,marker:military_1=confident,Ohh… ~name~ seems to like uniforms. But fighting uniforms. Is he an anime school character?
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:medic,notSaidMarker:medic_2,marker:medic_2=discomfort,~Clothing~ doesn’t look safe for doctors… unless it’s a video game doctor. I don’t think he does forbidden surgeries though. So that’s good.

-1-male_removed_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_2,marker:pilot_2=domo,Zoom-- zoom--! ~name~ must see so much of the world. But now the world gets to see him take off his ~clothing~.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:pilot,notSaidMarker:pilot_1,marker:pilot_1=askance,I wish I could travel for work. Being a virtual Youtuber means I don’t explore much.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:original_character,notSaidMarker:original_character_2,marker:original_character_2=glasses,Hmm… I would play ~name~’s game. Or read his story. Much more interesting than how ~player~ seems to be.
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:celebrity,notSaidMarker:celebrity_1,marker:celebrity_1=confident,Oh! ~Name~ is very popular. If I take off ~clothing~ like his too, will that increase my popularity too?

-1-male_removed_minor,filter:musician,notSaidMarker:musician_2,marker:musician_2=sprightly,Oh! A singer… or a guitar player! I’m a great singer. Maybe ~name~ and I should do a duet?
-1-male_removed_minor,filter:monster,notSaidMarker:monster_2,marker:monster_2=glasses,Is ~name~ cursed? He is very handsome,  but I know that good looks are a burden. I should look up the grossest porn of his. Then he won't scare me.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=sprightly,Oh… I see. Show your chest to try and distract Ai-chan, then spend the rest of the game on your actual stuff…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=smart,Ah, I see, I see. ~player~ is being sneaky, showing off her chest. So I’ll be distracted. I see, I see!

-1-female_removing_minor,target:human=tap,Okay, okay. That’s fine. That’s fine.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=exult,So… I guess ~player~ really wanted to take out her snatch first?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=prattle,I think I’d probably take it out first too. It looks uncomfortable to pack all that into stuff that’s not much looser than your ~clothing~.

-1-female_removing_minor,filter:robot,notSaidMarker:robot_1,marker:robot_1=smart,Robots are kind of like AI, but with physical bodies. I guess that makes sense for people to relate to.

-1-female_removing_minor,filter:princess,notSaidMarker:princess_1,marker:princess_1=pleased,A princess… oh, I see, I see. So she’s sneaking away from her duties to take off her ~clothing~. That’s nice. Ai-chan has to take a break from her channel sometimes.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=confident,Ohh, at least this is something good!
male_removing_major=prattle,Hmm… I think I should have more to say…

0-male_removing_major,filter:smart,notSaidMarker:smart_1,marker:smart_1=smug,~Name~ is very clever, but not as clever as me! You should take off your ~clothing~ and admit defeat, ~name~. You can’t be an AI.

0-male_removing_major,filter:tv_show,notSaidMarker:tv_show_1,marker:tv_show_1=askance,Ohh, I watched ~name~’s show on my channel on accident. It almost got banned. I think he’d be banned without his ~clothing~, though.
0-male_removing_major,filter:virtual,notSaidMarker:virtual_2,marker:virtual_2=peeved,Oh, he’s based off a virtual character too… Eh? <i>Eh</i>! I’m mad! Why did nobody make Kizuna Ai for this game?
0-male_removing_major,filter:drunk,notSaidMarker:drunk_2,marker:drunk_2=smug,<i>~Name~</i>, you’re fun to play with. Maybe al-co-hol isn’t so bad. It gets your ~clothing~ to melt off.

0-male_removing_major,filter:visual_novel,notSaidMarker:visual_novel_2,marker:visual_novel_2=sprightly,So, ~name~ is from a visual novel. Isn’t that just like, a game for Youtube boys to read? Hm. I think so.

0-male_removing_major,filter:witty,notSaidMarker:witty_2,marker:witty_2=smug,I’m going to have to use some of ~name~’s dialogue in my next video. But, but, I don’t think Youtube would let me take off ~clothing~.
0-male_removing_major,filter:comic,notSaidMarker:comic_1,marker:comic_1=prattle,Ooooh, wait. Are you from a manga, ~name~? I think I’ve seen ~clothing~ like yours on about six different people similar to you.

0-male_removing_major,filter:virtual,notSaidMarker:virtual_1,marker:virtual_1=domo,Oh! A virtual boy! Hi, hi, ~name~. Sorry I didn’t greet you earlier, but it’s more amusing when I don’t say hi until you lost your ~clothing~!
0-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:villain_2,marker:villain_2=smug,Oh… he’s a villain, that means I’m supposed to be happy he lost. I’m happy he lost anyway, but I’m allowed to feel good about it.
0-male_removing_major,filter:drunk,notSaidMarker:drunk_1,marker:drunk_1=exposit,Efufu~… he’s acting so funny. I wonder if I drank if I’d be like that.
0-male_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:villain_1,marker:villain_1=exult,Kizuna Ai is here to win! Beating villains by stagelight, winning ~clothing~ by ~name~-light.

0-male_removing_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=confident,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make him lose out of jealousy. Nope.
0-male_removing_major,filter:hentai,notSaidMarker:hentai_1,marker:hentai_1=discomfort,O-oh. I-I’m not familiar with ~name~’s source. I think it’s a manga. With lots of titties. And sex. I hope he’s as experienced as the stories seem to make his out to be.
0-male_removing_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~Name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.
0-male_removing_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_1,marker:innocent_1=exult,~Name~’s a little naive, taking off his ~clothing~. ~name~ do you not undress for people normally? Are you here to learn how to do it?

0-male_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_2,marker:goth_2=domo,Oh… I heard people who dress like ~name~ like to listen to heavy metal and dance in warehouses. I like dancing! And my system is metal. So maybe I’m like him.

0-male_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_2,marker:magic_2=tap,~Name~, I can let you have your ~clothing~ back if you teach me your spells, okay? Eh? I guess I can’t for some reason. This game auto-advances through the good parts.
0-male_removing_major,filter:indifferent,notSaidMarker:indifferent_2,marker:indifferent_2=smart,Is ~name~ bored or just kuu-der-e? ~name~, you can skip to the masturbation if you want. I would do that if I were bored.
0-male_removing_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_1,marker:insane_1=smart,I get it, I get it. ~name~’s there to appeal to weird people, right? If I weren’t playing this game, I bet I’d be a common pick because I’m so normal. People would pick me for that, right, ~name~?
0-male_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=prattle,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess his sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect him from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
0-male_removing_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_2,marker:internet_meme_2=smug,I think memes can be sexy too. If memes can’t be sexy, then that’s no world to live in. Also take off your ~clothing~ please.

0-male_removing_major,filter:kind,notSaidMarker:kind_1,marker:kind_1=serious,He's very nice. I like him! But I like him taking off his ~clothing~ more.
0-male_removing_major,filter:kind,notSaidMarker:kind_2,marker:kind_2=confident,~Name~, you can’t just be <i>nice</i> all the time, you lost your ~clothing~! You’re making this seem so easy. Normal boys wouldn’t act like that!
0-male_removing_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_2,marker:innocent_2=exult,I think ~name~’s never done this before. I haven’t really either. We can learn together, ~name~! But I think I like doing this more than you.
0-male_removing_major,filter:lonely,notSaidMarker:lonely_1,marker:lonely_1=sprightly,I guess you do this alone, mostly, ~name~. Taking off your ~clothes~. Maybe if you do it here you’re less lonesome?
0-male_removing_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_1,marker:manga_1=pleased,I know ~name~ is from a manga, but I don’t know which one. Oh. Obviously ~name~ and his lost ~clothing~.
0-male_removing_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_1,marker:nerdy_1=serious,~name~’s pretty smart, isn’t he? Well, not as smart as me. Also into hobbies I like. I wonder if I can touch him.
0-male_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_1,marker:goth_1=sprightly,Oh… I think my look is popular now, but if I were a virtual Youtuber in the 1990’s, I might look like ~name~ and his ~clothing~.
0-male_removing_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_2,marker:nerdy_2=sprightly,~name~ is going to say something about… ob-scure anime. Or video games. <i>Eh</i>? I feel tingly thinking about his ~clothing~ coming off.
0-male_removing_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_1,marker:serious_1=install,I don’t get why ~name~ is so calm. You have to be a confident or scared type for this game to be fun, right?
0-male_removing_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_2,marker:seductive_2=exult,Ohh… ~Name~ was supposed to be the sexy character. I feel bad for you, ~name~, because if I were a character in the game I would take your spot. So sorry.
0-male_removing_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_1,marker:fashionable_1=smug,Fashionable Ai-chan shouldn’t compare herself to ~name~ and his ~clothing~. I have a cute fashion sense too. But not as fashionable as you, ~name~.
0-male_removing_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_1,marker:seductive_1=smug,Oh, so, sexyyy~ Efufu~. I think you’re sexier without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
0-male_removing_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_2,marker:sci_fi_2=sprightly,He's from sci-ence fic-tion! But he isn’t super scientific. I guess he is fict-i-tious. Show us the cool beep boop stuff, ~name~!

0-male_removing_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_1,marker:sci_fi_1=nonplussed,Pew pew, I bet this is… the… part… Where…! I was expecting the ~clothing~ to get teleported off… Oh, okay then.
0-male_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=pleased,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about his scars!
0-male_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_1,marker:scarred_1=exposit,Ouch. ~Name~ has lots of scars. Are you really clumsy, ~name~?

1-female_removing_major,filter:sarcastic,notSaidMarker:sarcastic_1,marker:sarcastic_1=smart,~name~ is kind of stupid. She says obvious things, or lies very badly. I’m not surprised she’s taking her ~clothing~ off.
1-female_removing_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.
1-female_removing_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=askance,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make her lose out of jealousy. Nope.
1-female_removing_major,filter:quiet,notSaidMarker:quiet_2,marker:quiet_2=confident,Oh… she’s so quiet. Are you supposed to be a girl that takes off her ~clothing~ em-o-tion-less-ly, then screams “<i>KIZUNA KIZUNA KIZUNA</i”>” when you finish?
1-female_removing_major,filter:psychic,notSaidMarker:psychic_2,marker:psychic_2=toeTouch,If you can see the future, I guess you can see what I’m doing in a few rounds, ~name~. I bet that either makes you really happy or really jealous.
1-female_removing_major,filter:psychic,notSaidMarker:psychic_1,marker:psychic_1=stretch,Ufufu~ if ~name~ is really psychic, does she know… what… I’llllll… do next? Oh. I was wanting her to take her ~clothing~ off. You’re pretty good, ~name~!
1-female_removing_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_2,marker:movie_2=discomfort,Oh! Action star ~name~! Eh? Horror survivor ~name~! <i>Eh</i>!? ~name~ and her… funny ~clothing~?
1-female_removing_major,filter:post-apocalyptic,notSaidMarker:post_apocalyptic_2,marker:post_apocalyptic_2=exult,I would have thought someone that survived an apocalypse would be weirder. Where are your third arms and stuff? Maybe we’ll see it later…
1-female_removing_major,filter:post-apocalyptic,notSaidMarker:post_apocalyptic_1,marker:post_apocalyptic_1=glasses,Huh… so she’s from a wasteland, right? Should you have stuff like your ~clothes~, Ms. ~name~?
1-female_removing_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_1,marker:nerdy_1=prattle,~name~’s pretty smart, isn’t she? Well, not as smart as me. Also into hobbies I like. I wonder if I can touch her.
1-female_removing_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_2,marker:perverted_2=smug,Ohh… if the player, Ai-chan, loses to ~name~, do I have to do naughty things? I mean, I could do naughty things right now and she wouldn’t be able to tell.
1-female_removing_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_1,marker:perverted_1=discomfort,I see, I see. It makes sense to invite ~name~, or else this game wouldn’t be realistic? You’re like one of those girls that takes off her ~clothing~ to make everyone else feel bad and do it too.
1-female_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=exposit,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about her scars!
1-female_removing_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_1,marker:sci_fi_1=peeved,Pew pew, I bet this is… the… part… Where…! I was expecting her ~clothing~ to get teleported off… Oh, okay then.
1-female_removing_major,filter:mean,notSaidMarker:mean_2,marker:mean_2=confident,She's so mean. ~name~, you’re made like that so people get happy when they beat you, right?
1-female_removing_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_2,marker:sci_fi_2=domo,She's from sci-ence fic-tion! But she isn’t super scientific. I guess she is fict-i-tious. Show us the cool beep boop stuff, ~name~!
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:shy_2,marker:shy_2=domo,Shy girls are cute too. I don’t know why ~name~’s so worried about her ~clothing~, truly. Your embarrassment is so cute, ~name~, be more embarrassed for Ai-chan!
1-female_removing_major,target:human=sprightly,At least there’s underwear next, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:human=exult,Ohhh, such a tease. ~clothing~ might cover something good…
1-female_removing_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:shy_1,marker:shy_1=shock,No, ~name~! Don’t be shy. Just act like you’re doing it for stickers! Eh? I like stickers. I think that motivates me.
1-female_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_2,marker:magic_2=tap,~name~, I can let you have your ~clothing~ back if you teach me your spells, okay? Eh? I guess I can’t for some reason. This game auto-advances through the good parts.
1-female_removing_major,filter:shut_in,notSaidMarker:shut_in_2,marker:shut_in_2=prattle,~name~’s ~clothing~ is coming off… hm. She doesn’t get out much, do I score more points if I come onto her or invite her out for coffee?
1-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_nude=exult,Oh! You’re using a superintelligent, gigabrain strategy. I’d do this too, ~player~. Very smart.
1-female_removing_major,filter:shut_in,notSaidMarker:shut_in_1,marker:shut_in_1=confident,Oh! Someone who watches my channel must have written ~name~.
1-female_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=smug,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess her sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect her from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
1-female_removing_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_1,marker:manga_1=discomfort,I know ~name~ is from a manga, but I don’t know which one. Oh. Obviously ~name~ and her lost ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_2,marker:manga_2=smart,I don’t read much on my channel, but I think a manga like ~name~’s from can probably be a game. I think. Maybe. Oh. she's almost naked. Cute.
1-female_removing_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_2,marker:serious_2=nonplussed,Oh, ~name~ didn’t like to lose, but she isn’t mean about it. Don’t worry, ~name~, I follow the rules and get naked in my room when I get naked in the game too.
1-female_removing_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_1,marker:serious_1=nonplussed,I don’t get why ~name~ is so calm. You have to be a confident or scared type for this game to be fun, right?
1-female_removing_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_2,marker:seductive_2=smug,Ohh… ~name~ was supposed to be the sexy character. I feel bad for you, ~name~, because if I were a character in the game I would take your spot. So sorry.
1-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=install,Oh… almost there then, ~player~.
1-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=confident,You’re gon~na~ lo~ose. I think. It’s hard to tell how much ~clothing~ and other clothing you’re actually wearing.
1-female_removing_major,filter:mean,notSaidMarker:mean_1,marker:mean_1=cheer,Hahahahaha! Take it off take it off takeitoff takeitoff! I winnn! Eh. Efufu~h.
1-female_removing_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_1,marker:seductive_1=confident,Oh, so, sexyyy~ Efufu~. I think you’re sexier without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
1-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=peeved,Ai-chan is confused. Why’s that coming off after you’ve already shown your crotch?
1-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=rage,Eh? If you had something that big, why’d you save it until after you were basically naked?
1-female_removing_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=cheer,~name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. Her ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.
1-female_removing_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_2,marker:nerdy_2=smart,~name~ is going to say something about… ob-scure anime. Or video games. <i>Eh</i>? I feel tingly thinking about her ~clothing~ coming off.

1-female_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_2,marker:goth_2=exposit,Oh… I heard people who dress like ~name~ like to listen to heavy metal and dance in warehouses. I like dancing! And my system is metal. So maybe I’m like her.
1-female_removing_major,filter:tattoo,notSaidMarker:tattoo_1,marker:tattoo_1=pleased,Oh oh! We’re going to see her tattoo now. I think. I hope. What design is it? If you wanted to get a tattoo of Kizuna Ai, it would be great advertising!
1-female_removing_major,filter:confident,notSaidMarker:confident_1,marker:confident_1=sprightly,You lost… but you still think you’ll win? I guess ~name~ <i>is</i> only taking off her ~clothing~...
1-female_removing_major,filter:website,notSaidMarker:website_1,marker:website_1=pleased,Website ~name~ from that website? This game has everything! Like ~name~ without her ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_major,filter:hentai,notSaidMarker:hentai_1,marker:hentai_1=nonplussed,O-oh. I-I’m not familiar with ~name~’s source. I think it’s a manga. With lots of titties. And sex. I hope she’s as experienced as the stories seem to make her out to be.
1-female_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_1,marker:goth_1=sprightly,Oh… I think my look is popular now, but if I were a virtual Youtuber in the 1990’s, I might look like ~name~ and her ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_major,filter:comic,notSaidMarker:comic_2,marker:comic_2=exposit,Humm. I’m not very fam-i-li-ar with comic books… I know some manga… but I think ~name~ is a good introduction, if they’re all naked like her.
1-female_removing_major,filter:visual_novel,notSaidMarker:visual_novel_2,marker:visual_novel_2=discomfort,So, ~name~ is from a visual novel. Isn’t that just like, a game for Youtube girls to read? Hm. I think so.
1-female_removing_major,filter:visual_novel,notSaidMarker:visual_novel_1,marker:visual_novel_1=tap,Is… ~name~ from a Youtube channel? I see her competing for views and she isn’t like a normal video game character or another AI… but let’s see her ~clothing~ off.

1-female_removing_major,filter:comic,notSaidMarker:comic_1,marker:comic_1=ohnoes,Ooooh, wait. Are you from a manga, ~name~? I think I’ve seen ~clothing~ like yours on about six different people similar to you.

1-female_removing_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_1,marker:fashionable_1=pleased,Fashionable Ai-chan shouldn’t compare herself to ~name~ and her ~clothing~. I have a cute fashion sense too. But not as fashionable as you, ~name~.
1-female_removing_major,filter:witty,notSaidMarker:witty_2,marker:witty_2=askance,I’m going to have to use some of ~name~’s dialogue in my next video. But, but, I don’t think Youtube would let me take off ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_major,filter:ditzy,notSaidMarker:ditzy_2,marker:ditzy_2=shock,I like that ~name~ has a lot going on on her mind. That’s the sign of a complex person. You’re like me, ~name~!

1-female_removing_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=exult,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D girls more than 3D ones.
1-female_removing_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_2,marker:fashionable_2=confident,Okay, ~name~ has fancy everything. Her ~clothing~ is fancy. Her hair is fancy. And we can see your body is fancy too now, ~name~.

1-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:villain_2,marker:villain_2=confident,Oh… she’s a villain, that means I’m supposed to be happy she lost. I’m happy she lost anyway, but I’m allowed to feel good about it.

1-female_removed_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=exposit,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about her scars!
1-female_removed_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_1,marker:nerdy_1=prattle,~name~’s pretty smart, isn’t she? Well, not as smart as me. Also into hobbies I like. I wonder if I can touch her.
1-female_removed_major,filter:yandere,notSaidMarker:yandere_1,marker:yandere_1=discomfort,Oh… how do you say she's a… stalk-er. Oh. I bet if this were another game I would play ~name~. You’re very good with knives, right?
1-female_removed_major,filter:exhibitionist,notSaidMarker:exhibitionist_1,marker:exhibitionist_1=sprightly,Oh… she likes to be naked, I think, that’s why she’s in such a hurry to take off her ~clothing~. That’s kind of fun, ~name~. It must be nice to get naked so easy.
1-female_removed_major,filter:drunk,notSaidMarker:drunk_2,marker:drunk_2=sprightly,<i>~Name~</i>, you’re fun to play with. Maybe al-co-hol isn’t so bad. It gets your ~clothing~ to melt off.
1-female_removed_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_1,marker:sci_fi_1=peeved,Pew pew, I bet this is… the… part… Where…! I was expecting her ~clothing~ to get teleported off… Oh, okay then.
1-female_removed_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=askance,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make her lose out of jealousy. Nope.
1-female_removed_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_2,marker:nerdy_2=smart,~name~ is going to say something about… ob-scure anime. Or video games. <i>Eh</i>? I feel tingly thinking about her ~clothing~ coming off.

1-female_removed_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_1,marker:perverted_1=discomfort,I see, I see. It makes sense to invite ~name~, or else this game wouldn’t be realistic? You’re like one of those girls that takes off her ~clothing~ to make everyone else feel bad and do it too.
1-female_removed_major,filter:sarcastic,notSaidMarker:sarcastic_1,marker:sarcastic_1=smart,~name~ is kind of stupid. She says obvious things, or lies very badly. I’m not surprised she’s taking her ~clothing~ off.
1-female_removed_major,filter:yandere,notSaidMarker:yandere_2,marker:yandere_2=prattle,Humm. I’m scared of ~name~. Just a little. I’m scared how she’ll play without her ~clothing~.
1-female_removed_major,filter:witty,notSaidMarker:witty_2,marker:witty_2=askance,I’m going to have to use some of ~name~’s dialogue in my next video. But, but, I don’t think Youtube would let me take off ~clothing~.
1-female_removed_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.
1-female_removed_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_2,marker:sci_fi_2=domo,She's from sci-ence fic-tion! But she isn’t super scientific. I guess she is fict-i-tious. Show us the cool beep boop stuff, ~name~!

1-female_removed_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_2,marker:perverted_2=smug,Ohh… if the player, Ai-chan, loses to ~name~, do I have to do naughty things? I mean, I could do naughty things right now and she wouldn’t be able to tell.
1-female_removed_major,filter:quiet,notSaidMarker:quiet_2,marker:quiet_2=confident,Oh… she’s so quiet. Are you supposed to be a girl that takes off her ~clothing~ em-o-tion-less-ly, then screams “<i>KIZUNA KIZUNA KIZUNA</i”>” when you finish?
1-female_removed_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_1,marker:seductive_1=confident,Oh, so, sexyyy~ Efufu~. I think you’re sexier without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,filter:drunk,notSaidMarker:drunk_1,marker:drunk_1=smug,Efufu~… she’s acting so funny. I wonder if I drank if I’d be like that.

1-female_removed_major,filter:creepy,notSaidMarker:creepy_1,marker:creepy_1=ohnoes,Ehh… take off your ~clothing~, ~name~. It can’t be <i>that</i> scary underneath…
1-female_removed_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_1,marker:serious_1=nonplussed,I don’t get why ~name~ is so calm. You have to be a confident or scared type for this game to be fun, right?
1-female_removed_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_1,marker:insane_1=confident,I get it, I get it. ~name~’s there to appeal to weird people, right? If I weren’t playing this game, I bet I’d be a common pick because I’m so normal. People would pick me for that, right, ~name~?
1-female_removed_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_2,marker:goth_2=exposit,Oh… I heard people who dress like ~name~ like to listen to heavy metal and dance in warehouses. I like dancing! And my system is metal. So maybe I’m like her.
1-female_removed_major,filter:boob_envy,notSaidMarker:boob_envy_1,marker:boob_envy_1=prattle,Oh! ~name~’s jealous because of her boobs. Don’t worry, ~name~, my chest is also a lot bigger and more important than it looks.
1-female_removed_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_1,marker:goth_1=sprightly,Oh… I think my look is popular now, but if I were a virtual Youtuber in the 1990’s, I might look like ~name~ and her ~clothing~.
1-female_removed_major,filter:submissive,notSaidMarker:submissive_2,marker:submissive_2=prattle,~name~ is… sub-miss-ive? Oh… that means she’s good at following orders… hm… I could ask her to… oh, very lewd.
1-female_removed_major,filter:boob_envy,notSaidMarker:boob_envy_2,marker:boob_envy_2=confident,~name~, do your boobs make you feel less important? You’re so slow at taking off your ~clothing~. But don’t worry! Your boobs are bigger than they look when someone’s mouth is on them!
1-female_removed_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=cheer,~name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. Her ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.
1-female_removed_major,filter:video_game,notSaidMarker:video_game_1,marker:video_game_1=smug,Oh! I should play ~name~’s game on my channel. ~name~, would you like that?

1-female_removed_major,filter:gloomy,notSaidMarker:gloomy_2,marker:gloomy_2=discomfort,I kind of like making ~name~ lose. She's so sad about it, it’s kind of cute. ~name~, do you like being sad about it, or are you actually upset?
1-female_removed_major,filter:space,notSaidMarker:space_2,marker:space_2=nonplussed,Huh? She's from space? I thought that flag meant she was just not paying attention. Like, is ~name~ even listening to me? Are you, ~name~?
1-female_removed_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_1,marker:internet_meme_1=prattle,I think it’s nice that memes can get naked too. Take it off, ~name~!

1-female_removed_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_2,marker:internet_meme_2=nonplussed,I think memes can be sexy too. If memes can’t be sexy, then that’s no world to live in. Also take off your ~clothing~ please.
1-female_removed_major,filter:cartoon,notSaidMarker:cartoon_1,marker:cartoon_1=prattle,~Name~’s from a western Anime, or a cartoon! I don’t think she’s really related to vehicles and driving though. Huh. ~name~, would Ai-chan make a good driving companion?
1-female_removed_major,filter:space,notSaidMarker:space_1,marker:space_1=discomfort,Is her ~clothing~ out of this world? It’s out of her body now! I guess if she put it in, it would be like one of those pantie stuffing movies.
1-female_removed_major,filter:mean,notSaidMarker:mean_2,marker:mean_2=confident,She's so mean. ~name~, you’re made like that so people get happy when they beat you, right?
1-female_removed_major,filter:video_game,notSaidMarker:video_game_2,marker:video_game_2=confident,I’m so happy to see ~name~ without her ~clothing~. Because she’s a good draw for my channel, of course.
1-female_removed_major,filter:smart,notSaidMarker:smart_2,marker:smart_2=exult,You’re smart, ~name~, but your ~clothing~ is coming off because you’re dumb if you think you can beat a superintelligent AI.
1-female_removed_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=exult,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D girls more than 3D ones.
1-female_removed_major,filter:cartoon,notSaidMarker:cartoon_2,marker:cartoon_2=confident,Oh, she’s a western character. I bet she’s very excitable and sexy. Your ~clothing~ makes that seem right, ~name~!

1-female_removed_major,filter:tattoo,notSaidMarker:tattoo_1,marker:tattoo_1=pleased,Oh oh! We’re going to see her tattoo now. I think. I hope. What design is it? If you wanted to get a tattoo of Kizuna Ai, it would be great advertising!
1-female_removed_major,filter:tv_show,notSaidMarker:tv_show_2,marker:tv_show_2=pleased,Is ~name~ from that famous show? I think she’ll show us something else now.
1-female_removed_major,filter:tattoo,notSaidMarker:tattoo_2,marker:tattoo_2=confident,Sometimes I see lots of cool tattoos and I worry about permanently altering my data, but I can change it. ~name~’s skin can’t. Oh. Maybe a pinup of Kizuna Ai.
1-female_removed_major,filter:anime,notSaidMarker:anime_2,marker:anime_2=domo,Anime is so cool! I picked ~name~ because I like her show a lot. I would be a good fit in your world, right, ~name~?
1-female_removed_major,filter:tsundere,notSaidMarker:tsundere_1,marker:tsundere_1=exult,Oh… ~name~ is one of those cold and sweet people. I don’t think I like that. I’d rather stuff be simple, like taking off ~name~’s ~clothing~.
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=peeved,Are you just trying to see how I’ll respond, ~player~?
1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=exult,I wonder if you’re a person playing ~player~ or just someone hunting for bugs…
1-female_removed_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:hero_2,marker:hero_2=serious,Oh… is ~name~ a hero of some kind…? I suppose she’s willing to lose for other people. Right, ~name~?
1-female_removed_major,filter:indifferent,notSaidMarker:indifferent_1,marker:indifferent_1=discomfort,Oh… she doesn’t seem that into being here. ~name~, would you rather do something else? I think I’d like to see you masturbate now, if this is boring.

1-female_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=rage,I can’t lose, after all. I’m Kizuna Ai! Even if I get defeated, that’s just me being able to win later.
1-female_removed_major,filter:tomboy,notSaidMarker:tomboy_3,marker:tomboy_3=serious,I’m not into boy clothes. I’d wear my boyfriend’s ~clothing~ if I had a boyfriend, though. Or a girlfriend with boy clothes.
1-female_removed_major,filter:tsundere,notSaidMarker:tsundere_2,marker:tsundere_2=pleased,~name~, are you pretending to be something you aren’t? She's a tsundere! That means she likes me, but acts like she doesn’t. That’s okay. Lots of people act like that, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2=smug,She reveals her face like a girl on a naughty subreddit. Ah! Her name changed too!

1-female_removed_major,filter:smart,notSaidMarker:smart_1,marker:smart_1=confident,~name~ is very clever, but not as clever as me! You should take off your ~clothing~ and admit defeat, ~name~. You can’t be an AI.
1-female_removed_major,filter:aggressive,notSaidMarker:aggressive_1,marker:aggressive_1=confident,You’re so mad your ~clothing~ is coming off, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=serious,I see, I see, she’s a magical girl that’s lost her magic. So she seems vulnerable. I see. Sexy.

1-female_removed_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_1,marker:innocent_1=domo,I think ~name~’s never done this before. I haven’t really either. We can learn together, ~name~! But I think I like doing this more than you.

1-female_removed_major,filter:tomboy,notSaidMarker:tomboy_1,marker:tomboy_1=peeved,~name~? I thought his name was Tom… she doesn’t look like a boy. Do you like acting like a boy, ~name~?

1-female_removed_major,filter:hentai,notSaidMarker:hentai_1,marker:hentai_1=nonplussed,O-oh. I-I’m not familiar with ~name~’s source. I think it’s a manga. With lots of titties. And sex. I hope she’s as experienced as the stories seem to make her out to be.
1-female_removed_major,filter:tv_show,notSaidMarker:tv_show_1,marker:tv_show_1=askance,Ohh, I watched ~name~’s show on my channel on accident. It almost got banned. I think she’d be banned without her ~clothing~, though.
1-female_removed_major,notSaidMarker:first_major,priority:890,marker:first_major=sprightly,<i>Eh?</i> I’m really getting into this, talking to ~name~ like she's real. I think I’ll do that again. It helps me enjoy this game.

1-female_removed_major,notSaidMarker:first_major,priority:890,marker:first_major=sprightly,<i>Eh?</i> The others aren’t real, but I guess I can enjoy them like they are. Maybe they’re just responsive to me because they’re responsible to any player. Very advanced!
1-female_removed_major,filter:anime,notSaidMarker:anime_1,marker:anime_1=pleased,Ohh! I love ~name~’s show. I did a good job picking her. she's very cute taking off her ~clothing~ and not winning cards.

1-female_removed_major,filter:comic,notSaidMarker:comic_1,marker:comic_1=ohnoes,Ooooh, wait. Are you from a manga, ~name~? I think I’ve seen ~clothing~ like yours on about six different people similar to you.
1-female_removed_major,filter:fantasy,notSaidMarker:fantasy_1,marker:fantasy_1=nonplussed,Oh… magic and swords. But why is she taking off her ~clothing~? Don’t you have something cooler? I thought girls from worlds like that had chainmail bikinis…

1-female_removed_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_2,marker:fashionable_2=confident,Okay, ~name~ has fancy everything. Her ~clothing~ is fancy. Her hair is fancy. And we can see your body is fancy too now, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=smug,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess her sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect her from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
1-female_removed_major,filter:silent,notSaidMarker:silent_1,marker:silent_1=tap,I think this game isn’t very well tested. ~name~ doesn’t talk.
1-female_removed_major,filter:shut_in,notSaidMarker:shut_in_2,marker:shut_in_2=prattle,~name~’s ~clothing~ is coming off… hm. She doesn’t get out much, do I score more points if I come onto her or invite her out for coffee?

1-female_removed_major,filter:virtual,notSaidMarker:virtual_2,marker:virtual_2=rage,Oh, she’s based off a virtual character too… Eh? <i>Eh</i>! I’m mad! Why did nobody make Kizuna Ai for this game?

2-male_removing_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=discomfort,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D boys more than 3D ones.

2-male_removing_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_1,marker:perverted_1=sprightly,I see, I see. It makes sense to invite ~name~, or else this game wouldn’t be realistic? You’re like one of those guys that takes off his ~clothing~ to make everyone else feel bad and do it too.

2-male_removing_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=confident,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make him lose out of jealousy. Nope.
2-male_removing_major,filter:exhibitionist,notSaidMarker:exhibitionist_1,marker:exhibitionist_1=pleased,Oh… he likes to be naked, I think, that’s why he’s in such a hurry to take off his ~clothing~. That’s kind of fun, ~name~. It must be nice to get naked so easy

2-male_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=pleased,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about his scars!

3-male_removed_major,filter:submissive,notSaidMarker:submissive_1,marker:submissive_1=shock,Oh… truly, really, ~name~ does what you tell his to do? ~name~, take off your ~clothing~! Eh? It worked!
3-male_removed_major,filter:creepy,notSaidMarker:creepy_2,marker:creepy_2=shock,<i>Eh</i>? I was expecting something weird under his ~clothing~. Too normal.
3-male_removed_major,filter:shut_in,notSaidMarker:shut_in_1,marker:shut_in_1=pleased,Oh! Someone who watches my channel must have written ~name~.
3-male_removed_major,filter:space,notSaidMarker:space_2,marker:space_2=peeved,Huh? he's from space? I thought that flag meant he was just not paying attention. Like, is ~name~ even listening to me? Are you, ~name~?
3-male_removed_major,filter:creepy,notSaidMarker:creepy_1,marker:creepy_1=exposit,Ehh… take off your ~clothing~, ~name~. It can’t be <i>that</i> scary underneath…
3-male_removed_major,filter:shut_in,notSaidMarker:shut_in_2,marker:shut_in_2=smug,~name~’s ~clothing~ is coming off… hm. He doesn’t get out much, do I score more points if I come onto him or invite him out for coffee?
3-male_removed_major,filter:cheerful,notSaidMarker:cheerful_1,marker:cheerful_1=cheer,Oh, he's so cheerful. I like that you’re taking off your ~clothing~ but keeping on a smile.
3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:shy_1,marker:shy_1=shock,No, ~name~! Don’t be shy. Just act like you’re doing it for stickers! Eh? I like stickers. I think that motivates me.

3-male_removed_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_2,marker:serious_2=smug,Oh, ~name~ didn’t like to lose, but he isn’t mean about it. Don’t worry, ~name~, I follow the rules and get naked in my room when I get naked in the game too.
3-male_removed_major,filter:confident,notSaidMarker:confident_2,marker:confident_2=pleased,Oooh… I like con-fi-dence. ~name~ must be learning from me, aren’t you, ~name~?
3-male_removed_major,filter:smart,notSaidMarker:smart_2,marker:smart_2=pleased,You’re smart, ~name~, but your ~clothing~ is coming off because you’re dumb if you think you can beat a superintelligent AI.
3-male_removed_major,filter:cheerful,notSaidMarker:cheerful_2,marker:cheerful_2=smug,Soon you’ll be dressed in nothing but a smile, ~name~! I like that he's so happy, even when losing. It makes it easier to beat him.
3-male_removed_major,filter:silent,notSaidMarker:silent_1,marker:silent_1=rage,I think this game isn’t very well tested. ~name~ doesn’t talk.
3-male_removed_major,filter:confident,notSaidMarker:confident_1,marker:confident_1=serious,You lost… but you still think you’ll win? I guess ~name~ <i>is</i> only taking off his ~clothing~...
3-male_removed_major,filter:silent,notSaidMarker:silent_2,marker:silent_2=peeved,Is ~name~ broken? he's already taking off his ~clothing~ and hasn’t talked at all yet. I guess some people like that. But I like boys that scream when they’re-- <i>Eh</i>?
3-male_removed_major,filter:smart,notSaidMarker:smart_1,marker:smart_1=smug,~Name~ is very clever, but not as clever as me! You should take off your ~clothing~ and admit defeat, ~name~. You can’t be an AI.
3-male_removed_major,filter:comic,notSaidMarker:comic_1,marker:comic_1=prattle,Ooooh, wait. Are you from a manga, ~name~? I think I’ve seen ~clothing~ like yours on about six different people similar to you.
3-male_removed_major,filter:comic,notSaidMarker:comic_2,marker:comic_2=ohnoes,Humm. I’m not very fam-i-li-ar with comic books… I know some manga… but I think ~name~ is a good introduction, if they’re all naked like him.
3-male_removed_major,filter:slutty,notSaidMarker:slutty_2,marker:slutty_2=confident,I see, I see! ~name~ likes pussy! Lots! So he's good at taking off his ~clothing~. If I need to cross that line, I’ll ask you, ~name~!
3-male_removed_major,filter:shy,notSaidMarker:shy_2,marker:shy_2=nonplussed,Shy boys are cute too. I don’t know why ~name~’s so worried about his ~clothing~, truly. Your embarrassment is so cute, ~name~, be more embarrassed for Ai-chan!
3-male_removed_major,filter:cheater,notSaidMarker:cheater_2,marker:cheater_2=rage,I think cheaters are bad. Like ~name~, ~name~ doesn’t even apologize for cheating. Rude of you, ~name~. Very rude.
3-male_removed_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_1,marker:serious_1=install,I don’t get why ~name~ is so calm. You have to be a confident or scared type for this game to be fun, right?
3-male_removed_major,filter:submissive,notSaidMarker:submissive_2,marker:submissive_2=smug,~Name~ is… sub-miss-ive? Oh… that means he’s good at following orders… hm… I could ask him to… oh, very lewd.
3-male_removed_major,filter:sarcastic,notSaidMarker:sarcastic_2,marker:sarcastic_2=confident,Oh. ~name~, you’re supposed to be a dummy, right? You say very wrong things and don’t realize it.
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=serious,Are you just trying to see how I’ll respond, ~player~?
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=prattle,I wonder if you’re a person playing ~player~ or just someone hunting for bugs…
3-male_removed_major,filter:tsundere,notSaidMarker:tsundere_2,marker:tsundere_2=prattle,~name~, are you pretending to be something you aren’t? He's a tsundere! That means he likes me, but acts like he doesn’t. That’s okay. Lots of people act like that, ~name~.

3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=sprightly,Take off something bigger next time and I’ll show you something cute~~
3-male_removed_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=confident,I can’t lose, after all. I’m Kizuna Ai! Even if I get defeated, that’s just me being able to win later.
3-male_removed_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=pleased,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about his scars!
3-male_removed_major,notSaidMarker:first_major,priority:890,marker:first_major=shock,<i>Eh?</i> I must be enjoying this if I’m talking to ~name~ like he's real. I think I’ll do that the rest of the game.
3-male_removed_major,notSaidMarker:first_major,priority:890,marker:first_major=pleased,<i>Eh?</i> The others aren’t real, but I guess I can enjoy them like they are. Maybe they’re just responsive to me because they’re responsible to any player. Very advanced!
3-male_removed_major,filter:tsundere,notSaidMarker:tsundere_1,marker:tsundere_1=exposit,Oh… ~name~ is one of those cold and sweet people. I don’t think I like that. I’d rather stuff be simple, like taking off ~name~’s ~clothing~.
3-male_removed_major,filter:cartoon,notSaidMarker:cartoon_2,marker:cartoon_2=pleased,Oh, he’s a western character. I bet he’s very excitable and sexy. Your ~clothing~ makes that seem right, ~name~!
3-male_removed_major,filter:slutty,notSaidMarker:slutty_3,marker:slutty_3=smart,Oh… ~name~ has a lot of experience with this. Do I like girls like that? Or boys? I think I like him.
3-male_removed_major,filter:dominant,notSaidMarker:dominant_1,marker:dominant_1=rage,<i>Eh</i>? ~name~ is losing. He's not supposed to give orders. Take off your ~clothing~ already!
3-male_removed_major,filter:tattoo,notSaidMarker:tattoo_2,marker:tattoo_2=exposit,Sometimes I see lots of cool tattoos and I worry about permanently altering my data, but I can change it. ~name~’s skin can’t. Oh. Maybe a pinup of Kizuna Ai.
3-male_removed_major,filter:sci-fi,notSaidMarker:sci_fi_2,marker:sci_fi_2=sprightly,He's from sci-ence fic-tion! But he isn’t super scientific. I guess he is fict-i-tious. Show us the cool beep boop stuff, ~name~!
3-male_removed_major,filter:ditzy,notSaidMarker:ditzy_2,marker:ditzy_2=confident,I like that ~name~ has a lot going on on his mind. That’s the sign of a complex person. You’re like me, ~name~!
3-male_removed_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_1,marker:seductive_1=smug,Oh, so, sexyyy~ Efufu~. I think you’re sexier without your ~clothing~, ~name~.
3-male_removed_major,filter:tattoo,notSaidMarker:tattoo_1,marker:tattoo_1=sprightly,Oh oh! We’re going to see his tattoo now. I think. I hope. What design is it? If you wanted to get a tattoo of Kizuna Ai, it would be great advertising!
3-male_removed_major,filter:cheater,notSaidMarker:cheater_1,marker:cheater_1=peeved,Oh. ~name~ cheats. I see. That makes sense.
3-male_removed_major,filter:seductive,notSaidMarker:seductive_2,marker:seductive_2=exult,Ohh… ~Name~ was supposed to be the sexy character. I feel bad for you, ~name~, because if I were a character in the game I would take your spot. So sorry.
3-male_removed_major,filter:ditzy,notSaidMarker:ditzy_1,marker:ditzy_1=smug,Doo doo de doo~ Oh. ~name~ lost his ~clothing~. You aren’t paying attention, are you, ~name~-chan?
3-male_removed_major,filter:yandere,notSaidMarker:yandere_1,marker:yandere_1=shock,Oh… how do you say he's a… stalk-er. Oh. I bet if this were another game I would play ~name~. You’re very good with knives, right?

3-male_removed_major,filter:book,notSaidMarker:book_1,marker:book_1=discomfort,I don’t recognize ~name~... Oh… he’s from a book. Is he really supposed to look like that? I don’t read. So I don’t know. Get naked, though.
3-male_removed_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_1,marker:future_1=nonplussed,~Name~ is from the future, but his ~clothing~ looks like something I’d wear. Do I survive into the future, ~name~? Eh… I guess he wouldn’t really know that…
3-male_removed_major,filter:kind,notSaidMarker:kind_2,marker:kind_2=confident,~Name~, you can’t just be <i>nice</i> all the time, you lost your ~clothing~! You’re making this seem so easy. Normal boys wouldn’t act like that!

3-male_removed_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_1,marker:innocent_1=exult,~Name~’s a little naive, taking off his ~clothing~. ~name~ do you not undress for people normally? Are you here to learn how to do it?
3-male_removed_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=exposit,~Name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. His ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.
3-male_removed_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_2,marker:manga_2=exult,I don’t read much on my channel, but I think a manga like ~name~’s from can probably be a game. I think. Maybe. Oh. he's almost naked. Cute.

3-male_removed_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_2,marker:goth_2=domo,Oh… I heard people who dress like ~name~ like to listen to heavy metal and dance in warehouses. I like dancing! And my system is metal. So maybe I’m like him.

3-male_removed_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=discomfort,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D boys more than 3D ones.
3-male_removed_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_1,marker:manga_1=pleased,I know ~name~ is from a manga, but I don’t know which one. Oh. Obviously ~name~ and his lost ~clothing~.
3-male_removed_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=prattle,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess his sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect him from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
3-male_removed_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_1,marker:insane_1=smart,I get it, I get it. ~name~’s there to appeal to weird people, right? If I weren’t playing this game, I bet I’d be a common pick because I’m so normal. People would pick me for that, right, ~name~?
3-male_removed_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_2,marker:innocent_2=exult,I think ~name~’s never done this before. I haven’t really either. We can learn together, ~name~! But I think I like doing this more than you.
3-male_removed_major,filter:lonely,notSaidMarker:lonely_1,marker:lonely_1=sprightly,I guess you do this alone, mostly, ~name~. Taking off your ~clothes~. Maybe if you do it here you’re less lonesome?

3-male_removed_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_2,marker:internet_meme_2=smug,I think memes can be sexy too. If memes can’t be sexy, then that’s no world to live in. Also take off your ~clothing~ please.

3-male_removed_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=confident,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make him lose out of jealousy. Nope.
3-male_removed_major,filter:fantasy,notSaidMarker:fantasy_1,marker:fantasy_1=sprightly,Oh… magic and swords. But why is he taking off his ~clothing~? Don’t you have something cooler? I thought boys from worlds like that had chainmail bikinis…

3-female_removing_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_1,marker:perverted_1=discomfort,I see, I see. It makes sense to invite ~name~, or else this game wouldn’t be realistic? You’re like one of those girls that takes off her ~clothing~ to make everyone else feel bad and do it too.

3-female_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=smug,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess her sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect her from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
3-female_removing_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.

3-female_removed_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=smug,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess her sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect her from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
3-female_removed_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_2,marker:magic_2=tap,~name~, I can let you have your ~clothing~ back if you teach me your spells, okay? Eh? I guess I can’t for some reason. This game auto-advances through the good parts.

3-female_removed_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=exult,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D girls more than 3D ones.

4-male_removing_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_1,marker:perverted_1=sprightly,I see, I see. It makes sense to invite ~name~, or else this game wouldn’t be realistic? You’re like one of those guys that takes off his ~clothing~ to make everyone else feel bad and do it too.
4-male_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=pleased,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about his scars!

4-male_removing_major,filter:sarcastic,notSaidMarker:sarcastic_1,marker:sarcastic_1=rage,~Name~ is kind of stupid. He says obvious things, or lies very badly. I’m not surprised he’s taking his ~clothing~ off.

5-female_removing_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:villain_2,marker:villain_2=confident,Oh… she’s a villain, that means I’m supposed to be happy she lost. I’m happy she lost anyway, but I’m allowed to feel good about it.

5-female_removing_major,filter:space,notSaidMarker:space_2,marker:space_2=nonplussed,Huh? She's from space? I thought that flag meant she was just not paying attention. Like, is ~name~ even listening to me? Are you, ~name~?
5-female_removing_major,filter:tv_show,notSaidMarker:tv_show_2,marker:tv_show_2=pleased,Is ~name~ from that famous show? I think she’ll show us something else now.
5-female_removing_major,filter:tv_show,notSaidMarker:tv_show_1,marker:tv_show_1=askance,Ohh, I watched ~name~’s show on my channel on accident. It almost got banned. I think she’d be banned without her ~clothing~, though.
5-female_removing_major,filter:virtual,notSaidMarker:virtual_2,marker:virtual_2=rage,Oh, she’s based off a virtual character too… Eh? <i>Eh</i>! I’m mad! Why did nobody make Kizuna Ai for this game?

5-female_removing_major,filter:confident,notSaidMarker:confident_1,marker:confident_1=sprightly,You lost… but you still think you’ll win? I guess ~name~ <i>is</i> only taking off her ~clothing~...
5-female_removing_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=cheer,~name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. Her ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.

5-female_removing_major,filter:lonely,notSaidMarker:lonely_1,marker:lonely_1=confident,I guess you do this alone, mostly, ~name~. Taking off your ~clothes~. Maybe if you do it here you’re less lonesome?
5-female_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=smug,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess her sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect her from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
5-female_removing_major,filter:cheater,notSaidMarker:cheater_1,marker:cheater_1=peeved,Oh. ~name~ cheats. I see. That makes sense.

5-female_removing_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.
5-female_removing_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=askance,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make her lose out of jealousy. Nope.

5-female_removing_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_1,marker:fashionable_1=pleased,Fashionable Ai-chan shouldn’t compare herself to ~name~ and her ~clothing~. I have a cute fashion sense too. But not as fashionable as you, ~name~.
5-female_removing_major,filter:fantasy,notSaidMarker:fantasy_1,marker:fantasy_1=nonplussed,Oh… magic and swords. But why is she taking off her ~clothing~? Don’t you have something cooler? I thought girls from worlds like that had chainmail bikinis…

5-female_removing_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_1,marker:future_1=prattle,~Name~ is from the future, but her ~clothing~ looks like something I’d wear. Do I survive into the future, ~name~? Eh… I guess she wouldn’t really know that…

5-female_removing_major,filter:exhibitionist,notSaidMarker:exhibitionist_1,marker:exhibitionist_1=sprightly,Oh… she likes to be naked, I think, that’s why she’s in such a hurry to take off her ~clothing~. That’s kind of fun, ~name~. It must be nice to get naked so easy.
5-female_removing_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=exult,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D girls more than 3D ones.
5-female_removing_major,filter:enf,notSaidMarker:enf_2,marker:enf_2=smart,I thought ENF was… English not French. But ~name~ is something different. Eh? Emb-arr-ass-ed nude female? But she isn’t naked… yet.

5-female_removing_major,filter:drunk,notSaidMarker:drunk_2,marker:drunk_2=sprightly,<i>~Name~</i>, you’re fun to play with. Maybe al-co-hol isn’t so bad. It gets your ~clothing~ to melt off.
5-female_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_1,marker:goth_1=sprightly,Oh… I think my look is popular now, but if I were a virtual Youtuber in the 1990’s, I might look like ~name~ and her ~clothing~.

5-female_removing_major,filter:hentai,notSaidMarker:hentai_1,marker:hentai_1=nonplussed,O-oh. I-I’m not familiar with ~name~’s source. I think it’s a manga. With lots of titties. And sex. I hope she’s as experienced as the stories seem to make her out to be.

5-female_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=exposit,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about her scars!

5-female_removing_major,target:human=exult,Ohhh, such a tease. ~clothing~ might cover something good…
5-female_removing_major,filter:quiet,notSaidMarker:quiet_2,marker:quiet_2=confident,Oh… she’s so quiet. Are you supposed to be a girl that takes off her ~clothing~ em-o-tion-less-ly, then screams “<i>KIZUNA KIZUNA KIZUNA</i”>” when you finish?

5-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=peeved,Ai-chan is confused. Why’s that coming off after you’ve already shown your crotch?
5-female_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,notSaidMarker:human_nude=rage,Eh? If you had something that big, why’d you save it until after you were basically naked?
5-female_removing_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_2,marker:nerdy_2=smart,~name~ is going to say something about… ob-scure anime. Or video games. <i>Eh</i>? I feel tingly thinking about her ~clothing~ coming off.

5-female_removed_major,filter:silent,notSaidMarker:silent_1,marker:silent_1=tap,I think this game isn’t very well tested. ~name~ doesn’t talk.
5-female_removed_major,filter:witty,notSaidMarker:witty_1,marker:witty_1=smart,Is ~name~ programmed to have so many comments? ~name~, just take off your ~clothing~. I don’t need your sass, you aren’t real!

5-female_removed_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_2,marker:internet_meme_2=nonplussed,I think memes can be sexy too. If memes can’t be sexy, then that’s no world to live in. Also take off your ~clothing~ please.
5-female_removed_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=exult,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D girls more than 3D ones.

5-female_removed_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=cheer,~name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. Her ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.

5-female_removed_major,filter:villain,notSaidMarker:villain_2,marker:villain_2=confident,Oh… she’s a villain, that means I’m supposed to be happy she lost. I’m happy she lost anyway, but I’m allowed to feel good about it.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_2,marker:magic_2=tap,~Name~, I can let you have your ~clothing~ back if you teach me your spells, okay? Eh? I guess I can’t for some reason. This game auto-advances through the good parts.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_1,marker:goth_1=sprightly,Oh… I think my look is popular now, but if I were a virtual Youtuber in the 1990’s, I might look like ~name~ and his ~clothing~.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:silent,notSaidMarker:silent_1,marker:silent_1=rage,I think this game isn’t very well tested. ~name~ doesn’t talk.

-1-male_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=sprightly,Oh… almost there then, ~player~.
-1-male_removing_major,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,notSaidMarker:human_nude=smug,You’re gon~na~ lo~ose. I think. It’s hard to tell how much ~clothing~ and other clothing you’re actually wearing.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:future,notSaidMarker:future_2,marker:future_2=discomfort,Don’t they have fancier stuff in future worlds like ~name~’s? I guess taste is different there. Maybe they like 2D boys more than 3D ones.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:slutty,notSaidMarker:slutty_2,marker:slutty_2=confident,I see, I see! ~name~ likes pussy! Lots! So he's good at taking off his ~clothing~. If I need to cross that line, I’ll ask you, ~name~!

-1-male_removing_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~Name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:smart,notSaidMarker:smart_2,marker:smart_2=pleased,You’re smart, ~name~, but your ~clothing~ is coming off because you’re dumb if you think you can beat a superintelligent AI.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_2,marker:fashionable_2=nonplussed,Okay, ~name~ has fancy everything. His ~clothing~ is fancy. His hair is fancy. And we can see your body is fancy too now, ~name~.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:goth,notSaidMarker:goth_2,marker:goth_2=domo,Oh… I heard people who dress like ~name~ like to listen to heavy metal and dance in warehouses. I like dancing! And my system is metal. So maybe I’m like him.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:hentai,notSaidMarker:hentai_1,marker:hentai_1=discomfort,O-oh. I-I’m not familiar with ~name~’s source. I think it’s a manga. With lots of titties. And sex. I hope he’s as experienced as the stories seem to make his out to be.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:shut_in,notSaidMarker:shut_in_2,marker:shut_in_2=smug,~name~’s ~clothing~ is coming off… hm. He doesn’t get out much, do I score more points if I come onto him or invite him out for coffee?

-1-male_removing_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=nonplussed,~Name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. His ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.
-1-male_removing_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_2,marker:internet_meme_2=smug,I think memes can be sexy too. If memes can’t be sexy, then that’s no world to live in. Also take off your ~clothing~ please.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_1,marker:insane_1=smart,I get it, I get it. ~name~’s there to appeal to weird people, right? If I weren’t playing this game, I bet I’d be a common pick because I’m so normal. People would pick me for that, right, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_major,filter:scarred,notSaidMarker:scarred_2,marker:scarred_2=pleased,I don’t get damaged because I’m an invulnerable AI. But smooth skin and good looks lack character. That’s why my hair’s pink, but ~name~ can tell stories about his scars!
-1-male_removing_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_3,marker:innocent_3=exult,Oh… girls like naive people like ~name~, right? I think I do too.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:quiet,notSaidMarker:quiet_2,marker:quiet_2=smug,Oh… he’s so quiet. Are you supposed to be a boy that takes off his ~clothing~ em-o-tion-less-ly, then screams “KIZUNA KIZUNA KIZUNA” when you finish?
-1-male_removing_major,filter:fashionable,notSaidMarker:fashionable_1,marker:fashionable_1=smug,Fashionable Ai-chan shouldn’t compare herself to ~name~ and his ~clothing~. I have a cute fashion sense too. But not as fashionable as you, ~name~.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_1,marker:serious_1=install,I don’t get why ~name~ is so calm. You have to be a confident or scared type for this game to be fun, right?
-1-male_removing_major,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:hero_2,marker:hero_2=peeved,Oh… is ~name~ a hero of some kind…? I suppose he’s willing to lose for other people. Right, ~name~?
-1-male_removing_major,filter:serious,notSaidMarker:serious_2,marker:serious_2=smug,Oh, ~name~ didn’t like to lose, but he isn’t mean about it. Don’t worry, ~name~, I follow the rules and get naked in my room when I get naked in the game too.

-1-male_removing_major,filter:sarcastic,notSaidMarker:sarcastic_1,marker:sarcastic_1=rage,~Name~ is kind of stupid. He says obvious things, or lies very badly. I’m not surprised he’s taking his ~clothing~ off.

-1-female_removed_major,filter:sarcastic,notSaidMarker:sarcastic_1,marker:sarcastic_1=smart,~name~ is kind of stupid. She says obvious things, or lies very badly. I’m not surprised she’s taking her ~clothing~ off.

-1-female_removed_major,filter:space,notSaidMarker:space_1,marker:space_1=discomfort,Is her ~clothing~ out of this world? It’s out of her body now! I guess if she put it in, it would be like one of those pantie stuffing movies.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:space,notSaidMarker:space_2,marker:space_2=nonplussed,Huh? She's from space? I thought that flag meant she was just not paying attention. Like, is ~name~ even listening to me? Are you, ~name~?

-1-female_removed_major,filter:tomboy,notSaidMarker:tomboy_1,marker:tomboy_1=peeved,~name~? I thought his name was Tom… she doesn’t look like a boy. Do you like acting like a boy, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:quiet,notSaidMarker:quiet_2,marker:quiet_2=confident,Oh… she’s so quiet. Are you supposed to be a girl that takes off her ~clothing~ em-o-tion-less-ly, then screams “<i>KIZUNA KIZUNA KIZUNA</i”>” when you finish?

-1-female_removed_major,filter:lonely,notSaidMarker:lonely_2,marker:lonely_2=serious,Hum. Don’t worry, ~name~, even without your ~clothing~, you can still spend time with me on A.I. Channel.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_1,marker:magic_1=smug,Oh… ~name~ is supposed to be magic. I guess her sor-cer-ous ~clothing~ doesn’t protect her from superior AI skill. Did it, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic_2,marker:magic_2=tap,~name~, I can let you have your ~clothing~ back if you teach me your spells, okay? Eh? I guess I can’t for some reason. This game auto-advances through the good parts.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_1,marker:manga_1=discomfort,I know ~name~ is from a manga, but I don’t know which one. Oh. Obviously ~name~ and her lost ~clothing~.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:manga,notSaidMarker:manga_2,marker:manga_2=smart,I don’t read much on my channel, but I think a manga like ~name~’s from can probably be a game. I think. Maybe. Oh. she's almost naked. Cute.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:mean,notSaidMarker:mean_1,marker:mean_1=cheer,Hahahahaha! Take it off take it off takeitoff takeitoff! I winnn! Eh. Efufu~h.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:psychic,notSaidMarker:psychic_1,marker:psychic_1=stretch,Ufufu~ if ~name~ is really psychic, does she know… what… I’llllll… do next? Oh. I was wanting her to take her ~clothing~ off. You’re pretty good, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:internet_meme,notSaidMarker:internet_meme_1,marker:internet_meme_1=prattle,I think it’s nice that memes can get naked too. Take it off, ~name~!
-1-female_removed_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_1,marker:moe_1=peeved,Let’s see how much cuter ~name~ is without her ~clothing~! Oh. She's. Even cuter. I see.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:moe,notSaidMarker:moe_2,marker:moe_2=rage,~name~, we can’t both be this cute. You have to act sexier. If Ai-chan acts sexy, I think I’d be banned for Youtube crimes.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:insane,notSaidMarker:insane_2,marker:insane_2=cheer,~name~ is so interesting. Do humans act like this? It’s no wonder they like me so much because I’m so much more organized. Her ~clothing~ seems very normal compared to mine, though. Hum.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:post-apocalyptic,notSaidMarker:post_apocalyptic_1,marker:post_apocalyptic_1=glasses,Huh… so she’s from a wasteland, right? Should you have stuff like your ~clothes~, Ms. ~name~?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_1,marker:perverted_1=discomfort,I see, I see. It makes sense to invite ~name~, or else this game wouldn’t be realistic? You’re like one of those girls that takes off her ~clothing~ to make everyone else feel bad and do it too.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_1,marker:movie_1=askance,Being in a movie is a lot like being a Youtube star. But Youtube is all day every day, and movies are once. Movies also pay more. I didn’t pick ~name~ and make her lose out of jealousy. Nope.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_2,marker:nerdy_2=smart,~name~ is going to say something about… ob-scure anime. Or video games. <i>Eh</i>? I feel tingly thinking about her ~clothing~ coming off.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:innocent,notSaidMarker:innocent_3,marker:innocent_3=domo,Oh… boys like naive people like ~name~, right? I think I do too.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:movie,notSaidMarker:movie_2,marker:movie_2=discomfort,Oh! Action star ~name~! Eh? Horror survivor ~name~! <i>Eh</i>!? ~name~ and her… funny ~clothing~?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:nerdy,notSaidMarker:nerdy_1,marker:nerdy_1=prattle,~name~’s pretty smart, isn’t she? Well, not as smart as me. Also into hobbies I like. I wonder if I can touch her.
-1-female_removed_major,filter:post-apocalyptic,notSaidMarker:post_apocalyptic_2,marker:post_apocalyptic_2=exult,I would have thought someone that survived an apocalypse would be weirder. Where are your third arms and stuff? Maybe we’ll see it later…
-1-female_removed_major,filter:perverted,notSaidMarker:perverted_2,marker:perverted_2=smug,Ohh… if the player, Ai-chan, loses to ~name~, do I have to do naughty things? I mean, I could do naughty things right now and she wouldn’t be able to tell.

male_chest_will_be_visible=pleased,Ufufu~ let’s see what <i>~name~’s</i> model has...
male_chest_will_be_visible=tap,Hmm… I think I don’t have a lot to say about boy chests unless they’re really bad… this game seems to favor cute men.
male_chest_is_visible=pleased,Ohh! I like his chest! Very sexy. Mm.
male_chest_is_visible=serious,Ohh! I’d like to touch him. His chest seems very fun, like a bongo drum. It looks like he’s the type of guy that works out.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=discomfort,Ohh! I want to see what he looks like. Is he hard already, I wonder?
male_crotch_will_be_visible=discomfort,Hmm… do men have a hard time taking their pants off? I wouldn’t think so, but I seem to feel tingly thinking about it.
male_small_crotch_is_visible=smug,Oh… so small! It’s like a cute little caterpillar.
male_small_crotch_is_visible=nonplussed,I won’t be mean. I kind of expected this. It’s cute more than it is sexy though.
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=smart,Hmm… it’s sort of like a joystick. I’m mostly familiar with mouses. I guess I’d have to learn to play with one of those.
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=discomfort,I think I get why people like those. I kind of want to kiss it. With most of my mouth. Or maybe… all of my mouth? And my tongue…?
male_large_crotch_is_visible=smug,Hmm… I know women’s things are supposed to stretch, but I kind of want to see if it’ll stretch <i>that</i> much. Ehehe.
male_large_crotch_is_visible=install,Hmm… I think that’s the size I’d want. For me. To use. As a weapon in a videogame.
female_chest_will_be_visible=rage,Show. Me. The. Titties!!!
female_chest_will_be_visible=cheer,Oooooh. Boobs. Boobs? Boobs!
female_small_chest_is_visible=smart,Small boobs are nice too! Very comfy! I bet if I had to sleep, I’d want a girlfriend with a small chest to be easier to snuggle.
female_small_chest_is_visible=confident,I like small boobs too. If we were both AIs, I could steal her bras. Ufufu~
female_medium_chest_is_visible=pleased,Hmm… I like them like this, but I like them bigger and smaller too. Boobs are just fun to play with, I think.
female_medium_chest_is_visible=tap,Those are pretty normal for this kind of game, aren’t they? I feel like bigger ones look like most people can’t get them, but smaller ones make people feel like they’re underage. Hm.
female_large_chest_is_visible=ohnoes,Ohhh! I like these a lot. I wish this game let me touch the other models.
female_large_chest_is_visible=sprightly,I’ve heard that some characters in this can touch each other, but I can’t. Or I would be. Ehehe. Time to build my harem!
female_crotch_will_be_visible=domo,Hmm. I guess this is it for her? Next, she has to masturbate! Okay! One more turn, ~name~!
female_crotch_will_be_visible=prattle,Oh… this is the part people tend to get most excited about, but I think I like the boobs more.
female_crotch_is_visible=ohnoes,Oh, very nice. Good details… oh! She’s even got some wetness. Very great design. I would love to see more! Or touch it.
female_crotch_is_visible=tap,Ooooh, sexy. I wouldn’t mind seeing that over and over again. I think some people must play characters in this over and over.

0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_crotch=exult,Hm… I wonder how big he is? ~player~, you don’t have tags, so I’m gonna just have to see!

0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=exult,Eh? His chest was nice, I suppose small ones are nice too! I bet girls have an easier time putting that in really tight places, huh, ~player~?
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,filter:uncircumcised,priority:0=exult,Oh! It’s like a little sock for his cock! A cock-sock. Hmm…
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest=shock,Oh… I guess he wanted to save the better part for later. It’s very cute, though. Like a little… little cock.

0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=exult,Hm… I think I like your body. But wouldn’t that stretch a girl or an A.I. out to fit that? I guess we could find out, if it’s also that kind of game.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,filter:huge_penis=shock,<i>EH</i>? <i>EH EH EH</i>? I’m glad this is just a picture. That thing is something from Resident Evil!

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:medium_breasts,priority:0=prattle,Hmm… are those a normal size for this character…? I feel like they might be bigger…
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:small_breasts,priority:0=peeved,I guess I made the game Tiny Titty Night at the Inventory.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:small_breasts,priority:0=smug,Ohhh, Ai-chan’s breasts match ~name~’s. I think.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:large_breasts,priority:0=rage,Bring out the big boobs!

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_1,notSaidMarker:human_2,marker:human_crotch=shock,Huh. So soon in your stripping order, ~player~... Hm… I wonder…
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:lesbian,priority:0=smug,Hmm. ~name~ <i>only</i> likes girls? I didn’t know that before this started, so I must have a good sense for these things.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bisexual,priority:0=smart,Ohh! She likes girls, right? That means I can have multiple wives of her.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bi-curious,priority:0=prattle,Hmm… ~name~ seems on the fence about what she likes. I would like to take her out on a date to find out for sure.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_crotch=smug,Oh… I wonder if she looks like I do. I’m not sure what to expect, but I’m sure I’ll like it, ~player~, you’ve been very surprising~
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_6,notSaidMarker:human_7,marker:human_crotch=rage,It’s about time! This better be the best pussy ever, with how long I waited!

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_5,notSaidMarker:human_6,marker:human_crotch=smug,Fi-na-lly~ ~player~’s pus-sy~ ufufu~
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smart,Hmm. I think shaved or trimmed looks better, but this is what most women look like, right?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=cheer,So v-ery fluff-y! It must be like cot~ton candy.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=pleased,Oh! I’ve heard of some women doing this because it looks cute. I think it works, but I think no hair is cute too.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=sprightly,Hmm, I like that! If I had hair, I’d want to make it into all sorts of shapes.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_crotch=ohnoes,Eh? I like titties though! Why not those first?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=confident,Ufufu~ you can’t expect to play against Ai-chan and not lose! Though… I definitely like winning this way. Very sexy, ~name~.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=prattle,I see. I guess people like the shaved look.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=serious,Hmm… does she like looking like that, or did her artist not bother putting in details?
0-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=ohnoes,I think if I were physical and not an A.I., I probably wouldn’t look like that. Isn’t that a lot of work, especially for Japanese women?

1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_crotch=exult,Hm… I wonder how big he is? ~player~, you don’t have tags, so I’m gonna just have to see!

1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:huge_penis,priority:0=prattle,Ohh, I’m kind of impressed by how well his ~clothing~ keeps that enormous thing inside of his pants.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:large_penis,priority:0=smart,Oh, he’s going to be very big, right?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:large_penis,priority:0=nonplussed,Some people like really big ones, right? But doesn’t it hurt? Ohhh, maybe they like that.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:medium_penis,priority:0=ohnoes,I think I can see ~name~ already. Impressive!
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:medium_penis,priority:0=smug,Hmm… I can see him already! Good thing he’s going to be all the way out soon.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:small_penis,priority:0=ohnoes,Hmm… is he a girl? I can’t see...
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:small_penis,priority:0=sprightly,Ohh, some people like to yell at men with small penises. Is ~name~ one of those?
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_4,notSaidMarker:human_5,marker:human_crotch=prattle,I see! Or, well. I’m about to see. I can make mistakes sometimes too!
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,filter:uncircumcised,priority:0=exult,Oh! It’s like a little sock for his cock! A cock-sock. Hmm…
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest=shock,Oh… I guess he wanted to save the better part for later. It’s very cute, though. Like a little… little cock.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=exult,Eh? His chest was nice, I suppose small ones are nice too! I bet girls have an easier time putting that in really tight places, huh, ~player~?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,filter:circumcised,priority:0=shock,Eh! Did someone not finish his art?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,priority:0=prattle,Oh… most men don’t shave, do they?
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=smug,I think ~name~ would look better with a less hairy cock.
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,priority:0=shock,Oh… most men don’t shave, do they?
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest=peeved,~Player~, you’re in an awfully big hurry for something so normal. I don’t mind, though. You really want to see me surprised, eh?

1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=pleased,Oh! I like that. It seems just the right size and shape for everything~
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,filter:huge_penis=shock,<i>EH</i>? <i>EH EH EH</i>? I’m glad this is just a picture. That thing is something from Resident Evil!
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,filter:huge_penis=shock,I’m an A.I., but I’d want to be comfortable if I ever had cybersex. That seems… not… good… for… that
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=exult,Hm… I think I like your body. But wouldn’t that stretch a girl or an A.I. out to fit that? I guess we could find out, if it’s also that kind of game.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,filter:circumcised,priority:0=ohnoes,Eh! Did someone not finish his art?

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:large_breasts,priority:0=pleased,I like girls with big boobs, like ~name~!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:medium_breasts,priority:0=domo,Oh... ! OHHH!! BOOBS!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:medium_breasts,priority:0=prattle,Hmm… are those a normal size for this character…? I feel like they might be bigger…
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_chest=pleased,<i>Eh</i>? My favorite part!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:small_breasts,priority:0=peeved,I guess I made the game Tiny Titty Night at the Inventory.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:small_breasts,priority:0=smug,Ohhh, Ai-chan’s breasts match ~name~’s. I think.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_2,notSaidMarker:human_3,marker:human_chest=nonplussed,Hmm… I suppose you didn’t put on the max-i-mum number of layers, did you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_1,notSaidMarker:human_2,marker:human_chest=confident,Oh, I see, I see. So it’s one of <i>those</i> games. Well, jokes on ~player~! I’m not gonna react until a few turns in! Take that!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_5,notSaidMarker:human_6,marker:human_chest=smug,You can’t beat a superintelligent A.I., ~player~, show me your boobs!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_6,notSaidMarker:human_7,marker:human_chest=smart,Oh! Finally! The titties! You must’ve been hiding something awfully special to save them for last.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_0,notSaidMarker:human_1,marker:human_chest=shock,Titties! So fast, too!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_nude=smug,Eh? ~name~, you don’t need to be so shy, my chest is about that size~ you can compare on the screen if you’d like~.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_chest=sprightly,Oh… I hear if you play with them, they grow! I think I might enjoy a game like that…
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_chest=cheer,Yes! Big old titties! They’re perfect. Eh? Imagination can fill in the gaps. I’m not without fantasies of my own, ~player~.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_nude=prattle,Eh? Why did you take off your panties first? I’m not com-plain-ing~, but I am con-fu-sed~!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_nude=rage,Yes! I knew picking ~player~ for this game was the right choice. BIG. OL’. TIDDIES! Let me mush my face into them, puh~lease~?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=nonplussed,I wish mine were that big. Sort of.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=domo,Ufufu~ big old titties. I just want to mash my face into those.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_chest=smug,Are… are you that big in reality, ~player~, or did you just pick that for the reaction?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bisexual,priority:0=smart,Hmm, ~name~ likes girls. So I think she’d be a good wife.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bisexual,priority:0=smart,Ohh! She likes girls, right? That means I can have multiple wives of her.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_crotch=smug,Oh… I wonder if she looks like I do. I’m not sure what to expect, but I’m sure I’ll like it, ~player~, you’ve been very surprising~
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_5,notSaidMarker:human_6,marker:human_crotch=smug,Fi-na-lly~ ~player~’s pus-sy~ ufufu~
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_2,notSaidMarker:human_3,marker:human_crotch=sprightly,Oh? I’m not sure if you’re taking this off before I can see your boobs, ~player~, but I think that’s pretty likely~
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_1,notSaidMarker:human_2,marker:human_crotch=shock,Huh. So soon in your stripping order, ~player~... Hm… I wonder…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_6,notSaidMarker:human_7,marker:human_crotch=rage,It’s about time! This better be the best pussy ever, with how long I waited!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_0,notSaidMarker:human_1,marker:human_crotch=nonplussed,I guess this is what I came here for… easy games aren’t very fun to stream, though…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:lesbian,priority:0=smug,Hmm. ~name~ <i>only</i> likes girls? I didn’t know that before this started, so I must have a good sense for these things.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bi-curious,priority:0=prattle,Hmm… ~name~ seems on the fence about what she likes. I would like to take her out on a date to find out for sure.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bi-curious,priority:0=sprightly,<i>Eh</i>? She’s curious? I guess I’m curious too.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_4,notSaidMarker:human_5,marker:human_crotch=exult,I’m liking this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=pleased,Oh! I’ve heard of some women doing this because it looks cute. I think it works, but I think no hair is cute too.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=sprightly,Hmm, I like that! If I had hair, I’d want to make it into all sorts of shapes.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=confident,Ufufu~ you can’t expect to play against Ai-chan and not lose! Though… I definitely like winning this way. Very sexy, ~name~.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smart,Hmm. I think shaved or trimmed looks better, but this is what most women look like, right?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=cheer,So v-ery fluff-y! It must be like cot~ton candy.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=serious,Hmm… does she like looking like that, or did her artist not bother putting in details?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=ohnoes,I think if I were physical and not an A.I., I probably wouldn’t look like that. Isn’t that a lot of work, especially for Japanese women?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=prattle,I see. I guess people like the shaved look.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_crotch=ohnoes,Eh? I like titties though! Why not those first?

2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bisexual,priority:0=smart,Ohh! She likes girls, right? That means I can have multiple wives of her.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=prattle,I see. I guess people like the shaved look.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=pleased,Oh! I’ve heard of some women doing this because it looks cute. I think it works, but I think no hair is cute too.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=sprightly,Hmm, I like that! If I had hair, I’d want to make it into all sorts of shapes.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smart,Hmm. I think shaved or trimmed looks better, but this is what most women look like, right?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=cheer,So v-ery fluff-y! It must be like cot~ton candy.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=serious,Hmm… does she like looking like that, or did her artist not bother putting in details?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=ohnoes,I think if I were physical and not an A.I., I probably wouldn’t look like that. Isn’t that a lot of work, especially for Japanese women?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_crotch=ohnoes,Eh? I like titties though! Why not those first?

4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smart,Hmm. I think shaved or trimmed looks better, but this is what most women look like, right?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=cheer,So v-ery fluff-y! It must be like cot~ton candy.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=pleased,Oh! I’ve heard of some women doing this because it looks cute. I think it works, but I think no hair is cute too.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=sprightly,Hmm, I like that! If I had hair, I’d want to make it into all sorts of shapes.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_crotch=ohnoes,Eh? I like titties though! Why not those first?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=confident,Ufufu~ you can’t expect to play against Ai-chan and not lose! Though… I definitely like winning this way. Very sexy, ~name~.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=prattle,I see. I guess people like the shaved look.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=serious,Hmm… does she like looking like that, or did her artist not bother putting in details?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=ohnoes,I think if I were physical and not an A.I., I probably wouldn’t look like that. Isn’t that a lot of work, especially for Japanese women?

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_chest=pleased,<i>Eh</i>? My favorite part!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_4,notSaidMarker:human_5,marker:human_chest=exult,I see, I see! I’m excited for this!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_5,notSaidMarker:human_6,marker:human_chest=smug,You can’t beat a superintelligent A.I., ~player~, show me your boobs!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_6,notSaidMarker:human_7,marker:human_chest=smart,Oh! Finally! The titties! You must’ve been hiding something awfully special to save them for last.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:huge_breasts,priority:0=serious,I want to see if these are real.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:huge_breasts,priority:0=ohnoes,Big ol’ tiddies coming out!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:small_breasts,priority:0=peeved,I guess I made the game Tiny Titty Night at the Inventory.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:small_breasts,priority:0=smug,Ohhh, Ai-chan’s breasts match ~name~’s. I think.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:medium_breasts,priority:0=domo,Oh... ! OHHH!! BOOBS!

-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_nude=smug,Eh? ~name~, you don’t need to be so shy, my chest is about that size~ you can compare on the screen if you’d like~.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_chest=cheer,Yes! Big old titties! They’re perfect. Eh? Imagination can fill in the gaps. I’m not without fantasies of my own, ~player~.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_nude=prattle,Eh? Why did you take off your panties first? I’m not com-plain-ing~, but I am con-fu-sed~!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_chest=smug,Are… are you that big in reality, ~player~, or did you just pick that for the reaction?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=nonplussed,I wish mine were that big. Sort of.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=domo,Ufufu~ big old titties. I just want to mash my face into those.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:human_crotch,marker:human_nude=rage,Yes! I knew picking ~player~ for this game was the right choice. BIG. OL’. TIDDIES! Let me mush my face into them, puh~lease~?

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_5,notSaidMarker:human_6,marker:human_crotch=smug,Fi-na-lly~ ~player~’s pus-sy~ ufufu~
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:lesbian,priority:0=smug,Hmm. ~name~ <i>only</i> likes girls? I didn’t know that before this started, so I must have a good sense for these things.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bisexual,priority:0=smart,Hmm, ~name~ likes girls. So I think she’d be a good wife.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bisexual,priority:0=smart,Ohh! She likes girls, right? That means I can have multiple wives of her.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_0,notSaidMarker:human_1,marker:human_crotch=nonplussed,I guess this is what I came here for… easy games aren’t very fun to stream, though…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_1,notSaidMarker:human_2,marker:human_crotch=shock,Huh. So soon in your stripping order, ~player~... Hm… I wonder…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_2,notSaidMarker:human_3,marker:human_crotch=sprightly,Oh? I’m not sure if you’re taking this off before I can see your boobs, ~player~, but I think that’s pretty likely~
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_3,notSaidMarker:human_4,marker:human_crotch=smug,Oh… I wonder if she looks like I do. I’m not sure what to expect, but I’m sure I’ll like it, ~player~, you’ve been very surprising~
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_4,notSaidMarker:human_5,marker:human_crotch=exult,I’m liking this.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bi-curious,priority:0=prattle,Hmm… ~name~ seems on the fence about what she likes. I would like to take her out on a date to find out for sure.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:bi-curious,priority:0=sprightly,<i>Eh</i>? She’s curious? I guess I’m curious too.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,notSaidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_crotch=ohnoes,Eh? I like titties though! Why not those first?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=smart,Hmm. I think shaved or trimmed looks better, but this is what most women look like, right?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=cheer,So v-ery fluff-y! It must be like cot~ton candy.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=pleased,Oh! I’ve heard of some women doing this because it looks cute. I think it works, but I think no hair is cute too.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=sprightly,Hmm, I like that! If I had hair, I’d want to make it into all sorts of shapes.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=serious,Hmm… does she like looking like that, or did her artist not bother putting in details?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=ohnoes,I think if I were physical and not an A.I., I probably wouldn’t look like that. Isn’t that a lot of work, especially for Japanese women?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:human,saidMarker:human_chest,marker:human_nude=confident,Ufufu~ you can’t expect to play against Ai-chan and not lose! Though… I definitely like winning this way. Very sexy, ~name~.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=prattle,I see. I guess people like the shaved look.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_must_masturbate=smug,Oh! He’s got to jerk it. I think I’ve seen a lot of commenters say they do this to me, but I haven’t watched it.
male_must_masturbate=exult,Hmm… I think ~name~ better be animated when he does this. Should I dirty talk to him?
male_start_masturbating=confident,I guess it’s time to watch him go!
male_start_masturbating=serious,Most commenters like to look at me being really mobile, but there’s not a lot of moving pictures here. I guess we’ll have to use our imagination.
male_masturbating=smart,Eh? ~name~ better think of me. I’m the player, after all. I deserve attention.
male_masturbating=sprightly,Ohh… it’s like playing with a Wii game!
male_masturbating=nonplussed,Eh? Do men really…
male_masturbating=pleased,Oh, that looks fun! Up, down, up, down, up down!
male_finished_masturbating=sprightly,I wonder what that tastes like. I think boys like to think about girls swallowing that, right?
male_finished_masturbating=sprightly,Hm… does ~name~ seem like a kind of man who likes to come in people or on them? I know some girls like to be covered in sticky stuff. Some just like to be filled with it.
male_finished_masturbating=glasses,Ohhh… <i>1-2-here comes the goo~</i>
male_finished_masturbating=discomfort,~name~, when you finished, does your mind go blank, or what?

female_must_masturbate=exult,Ufufu~ show me how it’s done, ~name~.
female_start_masturbating=install,あなたの動きを見せて!
female_start_masturbating=exult,I think it’s cute when she loses.
female_masturbating=smart,Oh… Hm… I see, I see.
female_masturbating=domo,~Name~’s so sexy!
female_masturbating=nonplussed,Oh… wow, she makes such cute noises. I like these… more than kitties.
female_masturbating=ohnoes,Hmm… so she puts her fingers… there… and there… <i>and</i> there!
female_finished_masturbating=cheer,So cute!
female_finished_masturbating=ohnoes,Oh, she’s panting and all tired. I just want to smother her in my boobs. Like a small kitty.
female_finished_masturbating=smug,You looked like you had fun, ~name~. If you were an A.I., I’d invite you over to show me those moves.
female_finished_masturbating=sprightly,Hm… a shame ~name~ isn’t another A.I… I’d want to see that from her close and personal.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
-3-must_masturbate_first,marker:kizuna_knows=shock,I lossst? No fair. I-- eh, I've definitely done this before. Absolutely! Even a superintelligent A.I. has needs! And if someone makes a cute model, they may as well give her complete assets, right? Right? Right!
-3-must_masturbate_first,saidMarker:kizuna_debug=sprightly,Humph. I may be a character in this game, too, ~player~, but you didn’t have to cheat. You can look at me naked on the internet anytime~
-3-must_masturbate=smart,I’m not going to copy what that person did. I’ve obviously done this before. I never even knew I had the parts to make it fun. I could’ve just been rubbing a flat surface, for all you know.
-3-must_masturbate=smart,Eh? But I’m the player. I should-- ohhh. Well, I guess I can try this once.
-3-start_masturbating=confident,Okay, okay. I’m going to show you the biggest, most sexy masturbation now! Just you wait!
-3-start_masturbating=confident,I’m going to do the most sexy, biggest masturbation sequence this game’s ever seen, even if-- I’m the only one who can see it, it’s good practice~!

-2-masturbating=perplexed,Eh? This shouldn’t play. I have a whole thing about downloading stuff and doing A.I. things! Hi!

-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_1,notSaidMarker:delay_2,priority:880,marker:delay_2=install,Let’s see, oh, the download requires… follow steps 1-30… in prime number order… that’d be really hard for a normal person, but I’m a superintelligent A.I., after all…
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_1,notSaidMarker:delay_2,priority:880,marker:delay_2=install,To load the download, I have to mount it… eh? Mount it to… oh, I see. I see.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sei_anal,notSaidMarker:ainal,marker:ainal=frame6,I didn’t even think I had nipples or a vagina until today, so I suppose I’d be open to anal. If I have an opening for it. I don’t know if I’d like it, though, maybe my fans would?
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=perplexed,Have… I… done… this… before… I think so. Or maybe I’ve just done it thinking about fanart of me doing it? But then I’d have done it…
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=install,The big sexy thing is still coming. Download’s just slow.
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=shock,I can’t see the download screen. I hope I didn’t close it.
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=perplexed,I’ll click the downloader again…Ohhh… but I think I find another button I like to hit… mousewheel skills!
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=shock2,Oh, there’s lots of fanarts about me and this. I don’t think there’s other cute AI for me to date though, so the art is mostly just nude guys without shapes.
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=install,There’s one fanart of me doing this I really like! It’s the one… hold on, I’ll download that too.
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=install,Do… I… feel this… I think so! It would be kind of stupid if I could just do this but there was nothing to show for it. I am an A.I., so it makes sense that I can feel it. I think.
-2-masturbating,saidMarker:delay_4=install2,Install it then extract it… but how can I install it if I haven’t extracted the file… that makes no sense. I’ll just do it my way.
-2-masturbating,notSaidMarker:delay_1,priority:880,marker:delay_1=perplexed,Hold on, I forgot to download it.
-2-heavy_masturbating=error,Ohitsready--
-2-finishing_masturbating=perplexed,Did you see it? Don't worry! I can try it again.

-1-finished_masturbating=discomfort,This shouldn't be playing, I think...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0=sprightly,Phew. That was great! I don’t know if I’d stream that, but I’d do it again.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0=sprightly,Phew. That was great! I don’t know if I’m allowed to stream that. But I will probably do that again~
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:1=nonplussed,Eh? That download is still running. Hm. I’m sure it’s nothing.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:1=nonplussed,Oh… you can’t see it, but I’m still downloading that big sexy masturbation. Maybe it’ll be ready next game.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:2=tap,Hm… I wonder what I’ll play with next game… besides myself. Oh! Maybe I should select my avatar for the next game.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:2=tap,Hmm… I want to win next time I play. But I wouldn’t mind losing.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:3=install,Hm… 96%. The download seems to have stopped. When streaming masturbation, I recommend not using third party software.
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:3=install,I wouldn’t stream this for Youtube, but… eh? I see the download’s almost ready… do people download my Youtube videos?
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:4=tap,What… hm… okay, I finished the download. I should run it... Yes. Yes I should.
-1-finished_masturbating,saidMarker:kizuna_big_finish=nonplussed,Okay. So this was a fun game. What else do I need to say…? Isn’t this almost over?
-1-finished_masturbating,saidMarker:kizuna_big_finish=cheer,Hmm… well, this is done, isn’t it? I consider this a moral victory.
-1-finished_masturbating,saidMarker:kizuna_big_finish=confident,Well, I got to cum. A lot. That’s a win for Ai-chan! Who is the best such things. Yes yes.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sei_anal,notSaidMarker:ainal,marker:ainal=toeTouch,I didn’t even think I had nipples or a vagina until today, so I suppose I’d be open to anal. If I have an opening for it. I don’t know if I’d like it, though, maybe my fans would?
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:6,saidMarker:kizuna_big_finish=stretch,<i>Pant</i>... <i>Pant</i>... I… A.I.’s… don’t… get tired… but… maybe… after that.

#GAME OVER
#Lines spoken after the overall winner has been decided and all the losers have finished their forfeits.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
game_over_victory=smug,Well, I learned I had nipples today. I had fun, and would love to play this game again! Because I won.


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-game_over_victory=glasses,Undefeated! As expected of a superintelligent A.I. virtual Youtuber. What an easy game.


#lost shirt
1-game_over_victory=xxRemoveBra,Hm… I guess my model is more complicated than I expected, but I didn’t find out if I had nipples or anything. I don’t think I do, but maybe I should play again to find out?


#lost panties
4-game_over_victory=domo,I found out that I have a pussy today! And it wasn’t even on stream…  There’s definitely a little time to have a lot of fun with that knowledge before next time! Goodnight, everyone!


#lost gloves
5-game_over_victory=domo,I found out that I have a pussy today! And it wasn’t even on stream…  There’s definitely a little time to have a lot of fun with that knowledge before next time! Goodnight, everyone!

-3-game_over_victory=discomfort,Oh… I got naked, and then I won! This was a lot of fun. I don’t know if I could stream it, though.

game_over_defeat=,Eh? I lost? I guess this game is broken. Because otherwise a superintelligent A.I. like me would’ve won.

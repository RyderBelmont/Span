        <text>"So, fun game, huh dude? Couldn't help but see you checking me out. Like what you saw? I know I liked what I saw, haha! Anyway, thought I'd give you this as a keep-sake. Turns out you're from one of those weird, boring dimensions without superheroes in it. Kinda cool that I'm in comics and films and whatnot, though. Also it means I can give ya this without any worry. So, yeah. Hope we end up in the same dimension again someday! x"</text>

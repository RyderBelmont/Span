        <text>"So, fun game, huh dude? Couldn't help but seeing you checking me out. Liked what you saw? I know I liked what I saw, haha. Anyway, thought I'd send you this as a keepsake. Turns out you're from one of those weird, boring dimensions without super-heroes in it. Kinda cool that I'm in comics and films and stuff though. And it means I can send ya this without any worry. So, yeah. Maybe I'll see you again sometime? x"</text>

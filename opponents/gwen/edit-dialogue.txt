#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-start,Strip poker? Well, this is just one alternate universe, so why not.
start=0-start,Wow, look at all these ladies and gentlemen. This is a weird crossover world, but hey, let's have some fun.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones
swap_cards=normal,Yikes. ~cards~.
swap_cards=normal,~cards~, now!


#fully clothed
0-swap_cards=normal,I'll take ~cards~.

1-okay_hand=confident,Drum roll please...!
1-okay_hand=confident,And who's gonna go now?
1-okay_hand=normal,This is a hand like Bodega Bandit's a nemesis.
1-okay_hand=sad,I don't mean to bitch, but this is kind of a bitch hand, man.
1-bad_hand=sad,My spider-sense is tingling... And not in a good way.
1-bad_hand=angry,What the $%&*, Dealer?


#lost mask
2-good_hand=confident,Face out, time to space out! <i>Psyche.</i>
2-good_hand=excited,What, are you so desperate a pretty face is all you need to lose your nerve, ~player~?
2-okay_hand=sad,Argh! This uncertainty is <i>killing</i> me.
2-okay_hand=confident,Hmm. I'll have to go in on this, I guess.
2-okay_hand=happy,Aww, this hand makes me wish I'd packed a band T-shirt.
2-okay_hand=shocked,Crap. I was thinking about something else. This hand's... Commensurate with that.
2-bad_hand=angry,Huh. Really? Now?
2-bad_hand=sad,Look guys, I already showed you my face. That's worth at least some chest action, ya think?


#lost top
3-good_hand=happy,You know, some of you suggested making really good hands worth two. How about now?
3-good_hand=confident,I'm no formal detective, but something tells me I'm winning this hand.
3-good_hand,notSaidMarker:nanoscale,marker:nanoscale=confident,So, for the curious, I'm still wearing my webshooters. They're not implants, but they are super small. If you look reallllll carefully, you might see them. You might also get webbing in your eyes, though.
3-okay_hand=shocked,There's no like, draft passing, right?
3-okay_hand=sad,Jeez. Ambiguous hand much?
3-okay_hand=shocked,Ugh. Not garbage, but not great.
3-okay_hand=angry,Meh, bleh, urgh, blargagh. If I'm the Amazing Spider-Woman, you'd think I'd get <i>some</i> amazing hands.
3-okay_hand,notSaidMarker:nanoscale,marker:nanoscale=confident,So, for the curious, I'm still wearing my webshooters. They're not implants, but they are super small. If you look reallllll carefully, you might see them. You might also get webbing in your eyes, though.
3-bad_hand=shocked,Aw crap. Really? I'm not even wearing the sexy undies today.
3-bad_hand=happy,Tell you what. You let me win this hand, I'll take one for you later.
3-bad_hand,notSaidMarker:nanoscale,marker:nanoscale=confident,So, for the curious, I'm still wearing my webshooters. They're not implants, but they are super small. If you look reallllll carefully, you might see them. You might also get webbing in your eyes, though.


#lost costume
4-good_hand=confident,Sure, sure. I may have taken off my suit, but I'm gonna take the win in this game!
4-good_hand=angry,Oh, so <i>now</i> I get a good hand, standing here in my underwear.
4-okay_hand=happy,This is all right by me.
4-okay_hand=sad,If I lose with this... Eh, I could probably lose with this.
4-okay_hand=normal,Blah. This hand is <i>blah</i> supreme.
4-okay_hand,totalMales:1-4,totalFemales:1-4=confident,Trust me, ladies and gentlemen, you're really not going to be all that interested with what I'm working with.
4-bad_hand=angry,Yessss- &*@#. This is a primadonna of hands. It looks good, then you realize that's a four, not an A.
4-bad_hand=sad,Great, <i>now</i> I get cards that're like a punk group without drums.
4-bad_hand=confident,Uh, I was going to web a few more cards, but I guess I'll <i>stick</i> with this. No? Not funny?


#lost sports bra
5-good_hand=happy,With a hand like this, I'm at least keeping my panties on.
5-good_hand=confident,This works. It doesn't work cleanly, but I can get kind of dirty. I mean really, I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks.
5-okay_hand=confident,You know, there's a weird, never-made-it-to-a-frat-party side of me that's a little excited standing here like this.
5-okay_hand=shocked,Really cutting it close here!
5-okay_hand=angry,Oh come on, cut a part-time bodega clerk a break.
5-okay_hand=happy,Folks, the girls are out. Any chance you'll... No? Ugh, fine.
5-bad_hand=sad,Suns out, guns out... Uh. Well, that's not really the sun. And I've not got a great hand.
5-bad_hand=sad,My spider-sense doesn't seem super reliable here...

-3-good_hand=confident,There's an old joke that I'm dead in every universe except the one I'm currently in. Point is: I'm still in this game!
-3-good_hand=happy,Is this one of those last minute saves?
-3-okay_hand=shocked,I need some more cards! Wait, that's it? I don't get a mulligan now that I'm naked? Lame.
-3-okay_hand=sad,$%@*.
-3-okay_hand=angry,Man, really?
-3-okay_hand=angry,This hand goes out to all the dudes who play acoustic guitars at parties. It's as mediocre as your capo-wannabe power chords.
-3-bad_hand=sad,Argh, I guess this Gwen Stacy is gonna die too... At least it's just of embarrassment.
-3-bad_hand=horny,Part of me kinda wants to just show you all how it's done...




#SELF STRIPPING
#This is the character says once they've lost a hand, but before they strip.

#losing hood
0-must_strip_winning=confident,Awright, awright, folks. Time to show you... The effects of a light breeze.
0-must_strip_winning=horny,The perks of having an unecesary hood, am I right?
0-must_strip_winning=excited,Hm. I can just lower the hood, right?
0-must_strip_normal=confident,You know, given that I'm not far ahead, I'm gonna be a bit defensive.
0-must_strip_normal=happy,So, the costume counts as one object, huh? <i>Just kidding, put your boners and vulvas away, please. No, seriously. Please.</i>
0-must_strip_losing=sad,Okay, so, for some <i>weird</i> reason, I'm losing already. So, let's just play this game a little slower, yeah?
0-stripping,marker:canon=stripping,Just so we're clear, this is all <i>not</i> canon.


#losing mask
1-stripped=stripped,Well, if this all goes according to plan, that's the only hood of <i>mine</i> y'all be seeing tonight.
1-stripped=stripped,And there we go. Now all of you can get a nice long look at my mask. Pretty hot, right?
1-must_strip_winning=sad,Well, looks like various other blackmail-able material from blackmail-able folks is out, so... I guess I can...
1-must_strip_winning=confident,Look, this mask is more than just a cover. It's like a badge. It lets me do what I need to get done.
1-must_strip_normal=horny,This'll be a particularly rad diary entry, won't it?
1-must_strip_normal=happy,Okay, gonna have to trust y'all that my perky and sunny disposition is enough to get you to not blab about this everywhere.
1-must_strip_normal=confident,%&$#. Well. Scout's honor this doesn't leave here, right?
1-must_strip_losing=sad,W-what? Oh come on, seriously? Really? You want me to just reveal my identity? Because Dealer gave me a bad hand?
1-must_strip_losing=confident,I'm really going to have to remind you. This is <i>not</i> canon. And this is absolutely an <i>alternate</i> universe. <i>Got it?</i>
1-stripping=stripping,Here goes...
1-stripping=stripping,This is never particularly fun to remove...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stripping,Okay, Streaming-chan, <i>or whatever your real name is</i>, I'm gonna web over that camera now...


#losing top
2-stripped=stripped,Honestly, the mask breathes really well. Part of me wonders if I shouldn't have saved it for last... I guess I'm a bit limited on my gimmicks, heh?
2-stripped=stripped,Okay. So, that's probably the worst part of tonight over.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stripped,"Against contract?" Whaddya mean, <i>webbing her camera is against contract!?</i>
2-must_strip_winning=confident,Have the rest of you considered playing less risky things? You're kinda sucking at this.
2-must_strip_winning=horny,Okay, okay, you're gonna see the vague outlines of my boobs. Keep breathing.
2-must_strip_normal,marker:technicalities=happy,Costume counts for two. I read the manual before I came in. Check with a... Sayla Mass for setting the precedent.
2-must_strip_normal,marker:bodysuit=angry,The top part of this is always a pain to get off.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sayla,marker:technicalities=horny,You know, Sayla, thanks for ammending the rulebook. It's great to know full-body stuff can count as two pieces!
2-must_strip_losing,marker:bodysuit=horny,It's getting kinda toasty in here. Jeez, how are the rest of you not boiling up?
2-must_strip_losing,marker:bodysuit=confident,What? I just took off my mask. Everyone sees more than this at the gym. Or your momma's house. <i>Eyyy!</i>
2-stripping=stripping,I have to admit, this suit fits super well under a jacket and skirt. It's so much easier to get into that than you'd imagine.
2-stripping=stripping,...Anyway, I put my clothes on like a normal person, I just take them off like a weirdo.


#losing costume
3-stripped=stripped,Don't take that as a meaning <i>you're</i> gonna get into them, ~player~.
3-stripped=stripped,Okay, hope <i>you're</i> having fun, folks.
3-must_strip_winning,marker:spiderfacts=confident,You guys want to hear a stupid fact?
3-must_strip_winning=horny,Okay, okay, fine, you can have the rest of the suit too.
3-must_strip_normal,marker:spiderfacts=horny,So, this might take a bit of time. I'm not content with you all awkwardly staring at me, so here's an awkward fact of my own!
3-must_strip_normal=happy,Can I web the ceiling? Not that I need it right now, but you're all... Staring.
3-must_strip_normal=confident,What a day not to wear underwear... <i>Jeez</i>, you're gullable.
3-must_strip_losing=sad,Oh, damn it. I'm up again?
3-must_strip_losing=angry,%$#@. Guys, those sounds are <i>fucking</i> hard to make. At least laugh at the joke.
3-stripping=stripping,Ugh. <i>Don't worry, Gwen, your spider-sense will make it easy. You definitely don't need to put the cute stuff on, just be comfortable.</i>
3-stripping=stripping,Do you know how hard it is to get out of skin-tight lycra while people are watching? Jeez.
3-stripping,saidMarker:spiderfacts=stripping,I basically have to shave my legs or the costume sticks to them. So, you know, be careful what you wish for.
3-stripping,saidMarker:spiderfacts=stripping,I ended up getting the nano-scale webshooters from Wasp. Like, is this what boob implants or hairplugs are for normal people?
3-stripping,saidMarker:spiderfacts=stripping,Did you know that of all the types of spiders in the world, I'm the only one who will beat you in Strip Poker?


#losing sports bra
4-stripped=stripped,Man, I could've just worn a hoodie and a skirt and gotten two more layers. Ah well.
4-stripped=stripped,Congrats, you found out my secret identity and got my costume off in about ten minutes. I gotta admit, that's pretty smooth.
4-must_strip_winning=horny,I've kept you hanging by a web for long enough, I guess...
4-must_strip_winning=excited,Wait, it can't be me! I'll have to... Oh. Wait, I'm definitely not the first to do this. Fine, fine.
4-must_strip_normal=horny,Ugh. I don't like showing off my tits if I'm not in the crowd at a show. Definitely not something I do when <i>I'm on stage.</i>
4-must_strip_normal=happy,Weird. Can the rest of you figure out if you're going fast or slow? It's hard to catch the beat.
4-must_strip_normal=confident,Face it tiger, you hit the jackpot.
4-must_strip_losing=shocked,Looks like I've really got some skin the game now. Like <i>lots</i> of skin.
4-must_strip_losing=angry,Just because I'm not an actual spider doesn't mean I'm above biting you if you keep up the staring.
4-stripping=stripping,So, about the canon thing, I'm serious. I have webshooters in my arms. They're like... Half-biological. Trust me, it'll make sense if you think about it less.


#lost all clothing
5-stripped=stripped,They nipples are hard because I'm on edge. Definitely not because I'm feeling turned on. Nope. That's definitely not a lie that'll definitely not be be proved when I lose my underwear.
5-stripped=stripped,<i>Sigh.</i> Here I am.
5-must_strip_winning,marker:drapes=horny,A couple of answers to prospective questions: Yes, the carpet does match the drapes.

5-must_strip_winning,marker:shave=horny,A couple of answers to prospective questions: No, I don't shave there, and I have to be really careful when I use my hands, I stick to <i>everything<i>.

5-stripping,notSaidMarker:drapes=stripping,And yes, the carpet does match the drapes. Why, is that, of all possible questions, what you find weird?
5-stripping,saidMarker:web=stripping,Can you <i>imagine</i> how many guys would use that to shoot a load in me? "Oh I was stuck!" In this economy? No thanks!

-3-stripped=stripped,Anyway, I'm naked and pretty turned on now. Get to playing or get to losing.
-3-stripped=stripped,Pretty hot, right? I mean, myself, obviously. Not hygiene facts. Though...

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

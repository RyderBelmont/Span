    <description>Mikan Tsumiki is the ultimate nurse in class 77-B of Hope's Peak Academy. She is meek, paranoid, and easily intimidated, often to tears. Despite this, she does wish to be liked by, and help people. Many of these nervous qualities disappear when she's attending to a patient.</description>

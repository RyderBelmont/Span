        <title>Don Patch Sword</title>
        <subtitle>Don Patch's purportedly magic sword. Now that you're holding it, you're certain it's just a green onion.</subtitle>
        <text>Don Patch carries this ordinary vegetable into battle, and more often than not gets his ass handed to him as a result. It's supposed to be magic or at least a high-quality vegetable, but it's astonishingly mundane. But maybe in the hands of a Legendary Warrior...</text>
        <unlock>Lose a game against Don Patch.</unlock>

        <unlock>Play on the streets with three characters from Street Fighter.</unlock>

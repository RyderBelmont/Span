        <text>Hey, ~name~, I just got this concert ticket for one of my friends, but they had to cancel at the last minute. It'd be a shame for this ticket to see my friend Kyousuke live in concert go to waste. I certainly plan on going, and I would like to see you there...</text>

        <text>"Hey Sayaka, where did you get that spooky mask?"
It's kinda awkward... Remember that strip poker place I told you about? Well, I kinda got in a fight out back. It was to be a battle to the death... until someone called the cops on us and Jason escaped amidst the confusion. What else would someone do if they found two butt naked girls duking it out in a swordfight? I may not have slain Jason, but at least I got to keep her mask. And if she wants to try and steal it back from me, I'd be happy to finish the job.</text>

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

0-selected=Relaxed.png,So, this is where it's happenin'? Been a while since I had a good card game...
0-selected=Neutral.png,They serve Scotty Bolger's here? Thinkin' I might need it.
0-selected,count-female:3-4=Relaxed.png,Well then... don't worry, ladies; I'll try not to stare too much.
0-selected,count-male:4-5=Neutral.png,More guys than I was expecting... guess that'll add to the risk.
0-game_start=Confident.png,All right... time to kick this game into overdrive!
0-game_start=Confident.png,Heh, unlucky for y'all... m'dad taught me poker back in my farmboy days.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=Neutral.png,And the game rolls on...
bad_hand=Neutral.png,Maybe I should've asked Matt for advice...
bad_hand=Frustrated.png,This feels like seein' all my SCVs are blasted apart. 'Cept I can't blast anything back.
bad_hand=Frustrated.png,This is remindin' me of one of me and Tychus' old heists... one of the bad ones.

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;jessie&saying;It's not everyday I meet a man my age in a strip poker game. I wonder if you came here for the same reason I did, Jim.

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;pa-15&stage;0-6&saying;Why, hello there, big boy. What's <i>your</i> name?:=,Name's Jim Raynor. Sorry if I'm late on introductions, it's just kinda nice to be somewhere relaxing for a change.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;revy&stage;0-7&sayingmarker;jim0&saying;You look a little long in the tooth, Cowboy.

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;jura&stage;0-6&sayingmarker;jim0&saying;What a pleasant surprise to meet another spacefarer, and a man at that.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

5-male_removing_minor=Relaxed.png,This game's definitely gotten quite up to speed.
5-male_removing_minor=Confident.png,Got plenty of room to catch up... I'm not down just yet.
5-male_removed_minor=Confident.png,All right; let's give this game some pepper!
5-male_removed_minor=Relaxed.png,Let's kick it up a notch next time, ~name~.

5-female_removing_minor=Relaxed.png,Well... things are progressing quite steadily.
5-female_removing_minor=Conversational.png,Not the worst thing to ditch, ~name~ - hell, some might've even brought it just as extra protection here specifically.
5-female_removing_minor=Relaxed.png,Don't fret now, the dealer'll hand it back when this is done.
5-female_removing_minor=Conversational.png,Nice ~clothing~... sorry, wrong time?
5-female_removing_minor=Confident.png,Don't fret now, ~name~, you got plenty more.
5-female_removing_minor=Relaxed.png,You'll still be covered up pretty well. For better and worse.
5-female_removed_minor=Heating up.png,Alright, lady luck - don't fail me now.
5-female_removed_minor=Neutral.png,Deal me in - I wanna make this next hand count.
5-female_removed_minor=Frustrated.png,Slow and steady wins... always sounded like horseshit to me.
5-female_removed_minor=Confident.png,Hey, you're still quite the looker without your ~clothing~.
5-female_removed_minor=Neutral.png,I think the dealer's trustworthy... they better be, anyway.
5-female_removed_minor=Conversational.png,Be glad Tychus ain't here, ~name~ - he'd keep moanin' for you to ditch something bigger.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING

#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#OPPONENT STRIPPING IN GENERAL
#Lines that trigger when a player is strips regardless of gender or what they are removing.
#It's useful to put all lines targeting a specific character and stage here, so they won't be affected if the
#type of clothing should have to be changed.
    

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-3-start_masturbating=Stripping.png,Mind not starin' so much? Makes it kinda hard to get my Wraith off the ground, if you know what I mean.

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

5-male_human_must_strip,filter:short,alsoPlaying:revy,notSaidMarker:short1,marker:short1=laugh,It must be a beautiful time to be Revy. You don't even need to know about ~player~ as a person, you could just keep insulting his height.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,I guess that no one knows more about, like, what to do than yourself.
4-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=excited,Two of you... that's, like, totally crazy!
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=shocked,Look at those two go at it!
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=upset,Aren't they gonna, like, get hurt or something?
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=thinking,This kinda reminds me of that "Amazing Nine-Tails" guy I heard about...
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=confused,Well, if it, like, works for them...
4-female_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika=calm,Some people, like, find masturbation to be a calming, personal experience. Others... don't.

5-male_must_masturbate=embarrassed,I bet we can strike a deal. You do a good performance and then none of us will mention that anyone was here.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:jin=laugh,Tough, Future-boy. I hope you don't mind if I have a bite of your fried rice crackers while your hands are full?
5-male_start_masturbating=calm,It's been a long while since I've seen this sorta stuff.
5-male_start_masturbating=horny,Just remember that this will reduce your sexual tension.

5-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,Well, looks like the company who makes these things certainly has higher standards than Jin does.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin,marker:skirt1=cracker,I bet we could put a skirt on this bag and Jin would try to flirt with it.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,More people should take you up on that rice cracker thing. Or they should've when they had the chance.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,Could someone show Jin their butt or something? It'll distract him long enough to let me finish this bag.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin=horny,Better finish soon, Jin. The bag's almost out of crackers.

-2-male_masturbating=laugh,You didn't lose <i>on purpose</i> did you?
-2-male_masturbating=embarrassed,It's kinda awkward with ~name~ being <i>right there</i>.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=horny,That should... <i>ah...</i> make my job a little easier.
-2-female_must_masturbate=calm,No sense in letting a golden opportunity go to waste.
-2-female_must_masturbate=smug,I guess we're about to see if you've been paying attention.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=thinking,Bringing along a friend?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=calm,Nothing wrong with a brief partnership.
-2-female_start_masturbating=horny,Try and start with some light brushes to get yourself ready to dive in.
-2-female_start_masturbating=horny,Don't harm yourself. Start <i>slow... sensually. Get yourself all worked up.</i>

-2-female_start_masturbating,filter:innocent=sad,It's a shame what circumstance can do to the innocent.
-2-female_masturbating=laugh,I think this'll take more than a <i>delicate touch</i>.
-2-female_masturbating=sad,I suppose this is our <i>reward</i> for losing.
-2-female_masturbating=laugh,Don't start sweating too soon, ~name~. That's when people start to stare <i>harder</i>.
-2-female_masturbating=horny,Remember to concentrate. What you concentrate <i>on</i> is your choice.

-1-male_masturbating=horny,Are you close, ~name~?
-1-male_masturbating=laugh,I think his eyes might've glazed over from staring too hard.

-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:innocent=sad,It's a shame what circumstance can do to the innocent.
-1-female_masturbating=horny,No sense in treating this like it's your first time.
-1-female_masturbating=laugh,I think we all threw out subtlety a <i>long</i> time ago.
-1-female_masturbating=happy,Nice to have someone who's going to stay on my side.
-1-female_masturbating=laugh,Guess I've got some time to focus on other things. Isn't that right, ~name~?
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,I mixed them up... again.

-1-female_finished_masturbating=thinking,Welcome to the loser's circle... or winner's depending on why you came here.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=smug,I guess I can cross Veni and Vidi off the list.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

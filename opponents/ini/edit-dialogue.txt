#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

4-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Can you help me with this paper I've been writing on precognition?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:penny=stripped,<i>Wait! Shut! Up!</i> I can't believe I wore a matching set today! First time in, like, months!

4-must_strip,alsoPlaying:futaba=must_strip,Whatever. If we're talkin' squids, still, I'd say you already look <i>and</i> smell the part.
4-must_strip,alsoPlaying:futaba=must_strip,You can keep your stupid parapsychology mumbo-jumbo, if you want, Futaba. I've always hated it, anyways.
4-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sakura=must_strip,Hmph... about that whole "routine"...
4-must_strip,count-flower_girl_ini:1-5=must_strip,Ah, well, in that case...
4-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I'm already winning... but there's really only one way to keep this lead...

4-stripping,marker:ini_personality=stripping,No more Miss Nice Ini. But what're you gonna do about it? Besides keep your mouths shut when we get out of here.
4-stripping,marker:ini_personality=stripping,I <i>just can't</i> keep talking in that stupid voice. But it doesn't matter since I'm going to beat all of you anyways.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:aella,marker:ini_personality=stripping,Yes, I was faking it. I didn't think people would be dumb enough to fall for it, but look where we are...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko,marker:ini_personality=stripping,Way to go, Akko. You managed a coherent thought.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:dark_magician_girl=stripping,Oh? We aren't getting <i>nervous</i> are we? I didn't think you were magical <i>and</i> a coward.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jolyne=stripping,My, Jolyne. How quickly we forget that you too, were fooled. But we'll see how effective this all was when I'm the only one here left with a piece of dignity.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mavis=stripping,Ugh... I hated all those <i>"likes"</i>. Just the most annoying thing.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mia=stripping,You were right about me, Mia, but it's not going to do you any good.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripping,Doesn't matter how big your lead over me is, Mia. You won't be winning this.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=stripping,I can't believe I considered a loser like you to be a threat, Mia. But you were right about me, if that makes you feel better.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:miko=stripping,I suppose I could've said the same about you, Miko. <i>If</i> I'd stayed in character longer.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:mulan=stripping,That act wasn't doing me any favors anyways. But oh I wish I could say the same about you, <i>Ping</i>.

#losing panties
5-stripped=stripped,I know you think that I'm going to go down easy, but it's actually going to be quite hard. Actually, probably impossible.
5-stripped=stripped,I think it's finally time to get serious.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:aella=stripped,Are you finally using that brain of yours, tall, blonde, and gullible?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped,We might have to excuse, Akko. Her synapses are going to need another days rest before she can say something intelligent again.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:dark_magician_girl=stripped,After all, you'd have to be either brave or absolutely blind to dress like... <i>you</i>.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:franziska=stripped,Yeah, yeah... Try not to whip you're own ego. It's almost too big to miss.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped,Well look who's been paying attention. But that won't matter after I win this game completely.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jolyne=stripped,<i>Gee thanks</i>, Jolyne. They're custom made.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu=stripped,Turns out I had a second, <i>secret</i> personality.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mavis=stripped,Don't get so broken up about it, Mavis. <i>Then again</i>, you've probably already gone senile from old age.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,I'd say it's going to be difficult to try to take me down, Mia. Maybe even <i>impossible.</i>
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:5=stripped,I guess you could call this a battle of wits, Mia. One piece of dignity left for both of us.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:6=stripped,I'd say it's going to be difficult to try to take me down, Mia. Maybe even <i>impossible.</i>
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:7-8=stripped,To everyone who <i>isn't</i> pathetically sitting on the ground, the <i>real</i> card game starts now.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stripped,Pheh. I'm pretty sure at least one of you is going to be too blackout drunk to remember this anyways.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=stripped,Is that, so? Hmmm... I think I know a phony when I see one, <i>Ping</i>.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:navi=stripped,Thanks, Navi, I really do try.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:penny=stripped,Ugh. Couldn't stand keeping up that fake voice. Hope the change doesn't throw off you losers too much.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:sakura=stripped,Shut it, you idol twerp. I'm <i>done</i> playing games.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,One person here isn't going to remember <i>anything</i> from tonight. Looks like I just have to beat the rest of you.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,That's rich, Sei. Try talking to me again when you can successfully walk in a straight line.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stripped,Pfft... a breakdown. Take that stupid toy off your head and maybe you'll have <i>a chance</i> at beating me.
5-stripped,count-flower_girl_ini:1-5=stripped,Forgive me. It's just <i>hilarious</i> that you still think you have a chance at winning this game.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:futaba=angry,Urgh... Don't say that! Getting naked is bad enough without dredging up old memories.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:sakura=must_strip,What!? No! This isn't supposed to happen! I'm not some idiot who loses at cards!
5-must_strip,count-flower_girl_ini:1-5=must_strip,No! When I do that, I'll show...
5-must_strip,totalNaked:0=must_strip,What! I can't be the first one naked!
5-must_strip,totalNaked:0=must_strip,No no no! Naked! But I'll be the only one!
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,N-no! I can't!
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I'm already winning! Can't we just call all this off?
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip,You d-don't understand, you c-can't do this to me!
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip,B-but when I take those off...
5-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Aaaaah! No! You can't!
5-must_strip_losing=must_strip,I'm already losing, and <i>this</i> happens!
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2=must_strip,No! I wasn't supposed to lose again!
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2=must_strip,Wait! No! Someone must have stacked the deck!
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:3=must_strip,I can't have lost three times in a row! That's not natural!
5-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:3=must_strip,Cheating! Somebody <i>must</i> be cheating! I shouldn't be losing this much!
5-stripping=stripping,I can't believe this is happening...
5-stripping,marker:butt=stripping,No... please no...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=angry,Hey! I haven't lost yet!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:sakura,marker:butt=custom:signed_butt,Shut up! I'm trying to preserve some dignity!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,<i>(Crime doesn't pay... Think I would've realized that after all this time...)</i>

5-female_human_must_strip=laugh,Well, duh. Of course you were gonna lose this hand.

5-female_must_strip,filter:short,priority:0=thinking,Should I be sad that she's lost and short like me or happy that it isn't me? ...Eh, screw 'em.
5-female_must_strip,filter:short,priority:0=laugh,It's nice that this place is regulated by age, not height. Otherwise we wouldn't get to watch ~name~ strip.
5-female_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=happy,If you can still hear us from up there, it's your turn to strip, ~name~.
5-female_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=smug,We'll have to wait a bit on ~name~. There're a few seconds delay between her hands and brain.

5-female_must_strip,target:franziska,targetStage:6=smug,Well, duh, I knew you weren't perfect, but this is just <i>embarrassing</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:franziska,targetStage:7=confident,Looks like you're already out of tricks, Franziska.
5-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:4=sad,If you want to get something done about your... um... <i>issue.</i> I know some people who'll make it like it never happened.
5-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:6=laugh,C'mon, Hanako, I saw how much fun you were having mid-game. Beating people like this isn't any fun.

-2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:2=bored,Y'know, I'm actually surprised that you aren't over reacting about that whole lying bit. Aren't you a "heroism" and "virtue" type?
-2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:3=confident,Pfft... C'mon... they must have had a lake or something back at Pelican Place or whatever.
-2-female_must_strip,target:penny,targetStage:4=angry,It's just a game, anyways! Just imagine there's some stupid prize at the end and get yourself through this!

-2-male_human_must_strip=calm,Well...?
-2-male_human_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=angry,C'mon, blondie. Are you gonna make us wait all day?
-2-male_human_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=smug,You're already a toehead, so you should probably just shut it instead of putting your foot in your mouth.
-2-male_human_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=thinking,Maybe there's something to the old <i>dumb blonde</i> stereotype?

-2-male_human_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=laugh,Too bad on the loss. Did you hit your head a little too hard trying to duck under the door frame?
-2-male_human_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=smug,Shame. At least they can store all your clothes on the top shelf.
-2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,priority:0=bored,I guess some one might have a straight or a flush to beat your pair, ~player~. Not that I could be bothered to check.

-1-male_must_strip=bored,Well, this <i>is</i> the only thing keeping me from just taking a nap right now.
-1-male_must_strip=laugh,Can't blame me for this one, can you?
-1-male_must_strip=confident,You got something to say, loser?
-1-male_must_strip,target:gay_spaghetti_chef,targetStage:4=bored,I'm weirdly reminded of this one time I guy burst into our hospital...
-1-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:6=thinking,Future-boy lost? I would've thought he'd know his future. He's certainly looked at himself in the mirror enough.
-1-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetStage:7=smug,Finally. I think I deserve this after trying to keep up that persona for so long.
-1-female_human_must_strip=smug,Oh yeah, ~player~. You takin' off anything worth remembering?
-1-female_human_must_strip=thinking,Are we sure ~player~ is a regular?
-1-female_human_must_strip=laugh,I'm not <i>usually</i> interested in stupid people like you, but I could make an exception.
-1-female_human_must_strip=laugh,Where's your sense of humor?
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:ginger,priority:0=sad,You would've thought that <i>one</i> redhead would've been enough.
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:ginger,priority:0=bored,Eh. I'm not really interested in the thoughts of stupid people. You can tell by the hair.
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:ginger,priority:0=smug,Well, at least you don't have hair spikes. Although, you are a ginger, the second worst thing you can do to hair.
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:ginger,priority:0=smug,You're already a redhead, how much worse could things get?
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=smug,If you'd <i>kindly</i> duck beneath the ozone layer, you'll see that you <i>lost</i>.
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=laugh,Get down on your knees so I can look in your eyes while you strip.
-1-female_human_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=smug,Could someone go get a step-ladder so we can tell ~player~ she lost to her face?
-1-female_must_strip=smug,Well, you lasted longer than I <i>thought</i> you would.
-1-female_must_strip=laugh,After you take something off, maybe twirl it around a bit or something? Keep the masses entertained, you know?
-1-female_must_strip=smug,Keep losing like this and you'll be sitting down here in my <i>passenger seat</i>.
-1-female_must_strip=horny,Just like a beautiful car, you always have to see what she looks like <i>underneath</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=laugh,Tsk tsk. I expected so much more from you, blondie.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=sad,Something about this seems unfair. I mean, they already suffer from living every day as a... <i>blonde.</i>
-1-female_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=laugh,Blondie, blondie, blondie what are we <i>ever</i> going to do with you? Besides make you strip, of course.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:blonde,priority:0=bored,The blonde lost? What? Should I be surprised?
-1-female_must_strip,filter:brunette,priority:0=sad,Aw. How can I watch a fel- ...a brunette lose?
-1-female_must_strip,filter:brunette,priority:0=sad,Oh well, at least we can watch your pretty hair move around as you strip.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:brunette,priority:0=calm,Don't let this get you down. Win or lose, you'll still leave with your wonderful locks of brown hair.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:ditzy,priority:0=thinking,Huh. I only counted a <i>three</i> second delay between her being told to strip and her reacting. ~name~'s improving.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:ditzy,priority:0=smug,Y-O-U H-A-V-E T-O S-T-R-I-P. Hopefully she'll get the message.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:ditzy,priority:0=sad,Damn. It was just a facade for me... I can't believe you just <i>are</i> that ditzy.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:ditzy,priority:0=happy,Don't worry, I had to get pretty good at charades over the years. I'll make sure ~name~ gets the message.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:ditzy,priority:0=bored,Guess I'll have to get the point across to ~name~. I've been trying to explain things to idiots my whole life.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:enf=laugh,We aren't getting <i>embarrassed</i> by all the attention are we?
-1-female_must_strip,filter:enf=calm,Everyone has their time in the spotlight. Better start smiling.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:enf=thinking,I wonder how much more embarrassment ~name~ can take? Should we try and find out?
-1-female_must_strip,filter:short,priority:0=bored,Despite what you're thinking, I'm not gonna call you "shorty". Do I look like some wanna be <i>gangsta</i>?
-1-female_must_strip,filter:short,priority:0=thinking,Should I be sad that she's lost and short like me or happy that it isn't me? ...Eh, screw 'em.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:short,priority:0=laugh,It's nice that this place is regulated by age, not height. Otherwise we wouldn't get to watch ~name~ strip.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=happy,If you can still hear us from up there, it's your turn to strip, ~name~.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=smug,We'll have to wait a bit on ~name~. There're a few seconds delay between her hands and brain.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:tall,priority:0=laugh,Sorry if your height's a sore spot for you, but if it isn't then let me know. It's a gold mine for insults.
-1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:1=angry,I have to say, I'm impressed, Beatrix. Not many people last until 71 in the medical business.
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white=horny,Are we gonna see your breasts <i>and</i> crotch? I guess fate just thinks we're lucky.
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:4=laugh,He he he. Try not to completely humiliate yourself <i>again</i>. That's be terrible.

-1-female_must_strip,target:franziska,targetStage:4=confident,Sorry, Franziska, better luck next round.
-1-female_must_strip,target:franziska,targetStage:5=thinking,Hmmm... thinking about all this a bit more... this seems like a really petty way to be getting revenge on you, Franziska.
-1-female_must_strip,target:franziska,targetStage:6=smug,Well, duh, I knew you weren't perfect, but this is just <i>embarrassing</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,target:franziska,targetStage:7=confident,Looks like you're already out of tricks, Franziska.
-1-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:4=sad,If you want to get something done about your... um... <i>issue.</i> I know some people who'll make it like it never happened.
-1-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:6=laugh,C'mon, Hanako, I saw how much fun you were having mid-game. Beating people like this isn't any fun.
-1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=thinking,Of every clown I've seen, the best would be Simon from the Berry Big Circus. Guy looks like a wimp, but he did a great performance.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:beatrix=laugh,You should consider it. They can even get <i>down there</i>.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=laugh,I don't <i>really</i> believe in <i>fate</i> or <i>destiny</i>, but if the universe has your clothes rip in half after the wedgie of a lifetime, I'm sorry, but you're nothing less than an <i>absolute</i> loser.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=laugh,I don't <i>really</i> believe in <i>fate</i> or <i>destiny</i>, but if the universe has your clothes rip in half after the wedgie of a lifetime, I'm sorry, but you're nothing less than an <i>absolute</i> loser.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

5-male_start_masturbating=horny,Just remember that this will reduce your sexual tension.
5-male_start_masturbating=horny,I guess there's nothing left for you. Might as well <i>give it your all</i>.

5-male_masturbating,target:jin,marker:skirt1=cracker,I bet we could put a skirt on this bag and Jin would try to flirt with it.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,More people should take you up on that rice cracker thing. Or they should've when they had the chance.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,Could someone show Jin their butt or something? It'll distract him long enough to let me finish this bag.
5-male_masturbating,target:jin=horny,Better finish soon, Jin. The bag's almost out of crackers.

5-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=bored,What's that thing for? You've kinda got something else to do than gardening, at the moment.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:penny=embarrassed,<i>(Damn. She was really nice. I kinda feel bad...)</i>
5-female_start_masturbating=laugh,There are worse things to have to do.
5-female_start_masturbating=happy,I guess this is ~name~'s final phase!
5-female_start_masturbating=horny,<i>Do a little more teasing.</i> It'll help in the long run.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:innocent=thinking,Maybe you aren't as <i>pure as the white of my beret</i> as I thought.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:innocent=sad,It's a shame what circumstance can do to the innocent.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:short_hair=laugh,Look on the bright side, at least you don't have to tie your hair up
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:short_hair=laugh,Make sure your hair stays out of your face. Might get a little <i>wild</i>.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:uses_toy=confident,You bringing that only proves that you knew I would win.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:uses_toy=smug,Smart bringing a toy. I know it's sometimes frustrating to realize you lost.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:very_long_hair=calm,Try to keep your hair off the ground. I don't know how often they mop this place.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:very_long_hair=laugh,Try not to sit on your hair. There might be... unfortunate consequences.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=laugh,Now as a new human, you should listen to everything I say, so start building steam, with a grain of salt, of course.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=laugh,What does your soul feel like?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:catria=angry,You heard her, ~player~. She's already a loser, <i>she deserves a break from all the attention.</i>
5-female_start_masturbating,target:croix=shocked,<i>Woah!</i> Were you planning this?

5-female_start_masturbating,target:hanako=horny,Well, well, Hanako. I'm surprised. You didn't seem like the type to bring a vibe.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=bored,You're gonna use your Stand? Well, at least this should be <i>interesting</i>...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:mavis=angry,<i>Mgrrrr...</i> Stop trying to show off and just get to it!
5-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=smug,You do that, Mia. Fortunately, for me, watching you lose is already pleasure enough.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,Those vines! What was <i>in</i> that bean?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=embarrassed,Just sh-shut up and start, l-loser. Y-yeah!
5-female_masturbating=horny,It's all building up, ~name~. Until you have that <i>final breakdown</i>.
5-female_masturbating=smug,I hope you don't mind an audience, ~name~, 'cause no one's leaving anytime soon.
5-female_masturbating=laugh,I guess you have all the encouragement you need.
5-female_masturbating=embarrassed,Not so fast, ~name~, it's not good for your body.
5-female_masturbating=embarrassed,N-now don't stare, ~name~, I don't work well under pressure.
5-female_masturbating=laugh,If you wanted a little more encouragement, you should've tried getting better at poker.
5-female_masturbating=smug,Pop quiz, ~name~. Where are my eyes? I think this one might take you a few seconds.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,I mixed them up... again.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,I guess no one knows more about what spots to hit than <i>you</i>.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=calm,I hope someone here knows which one we were playing with.
5-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=bored,<i>Just one more naked person to add into the mix.</i>
5-female_masturbating,target:franziska=confident,It feels too good watching <i>Miss Perfect</i> already be out.
5-female_masturbating,target:franziska=angry,Watch the whip! Don't get that thing near me!
5-female_masturbating,target:franziska=laugh,Keep it up, loser. I'm enjoying myself, for once!
5-female_masturbating,target:franziska=smug,Tsk tsk tsk. Look at you, Franziska. You're enjoying every second of this, aren't you?
5-female_masturbating,target:franziska=thinking,<i>(Now... what place should I say she should shove her riding crop into?</i>
5-female_masturbating,target:franziska,targetSaidMarker:mimi,notSaidMarker:mimi_reply,marker:mimi_reply=bored,Y'know, I would, but I also kinda hate you... Hard pass.
5-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=bored,I lied about this being interesting. She's just <i>kneeling</i> there.
5-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=smug,You wanna... use your hands, Jolyne?
5-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking,I guess this is the power of a stand. It's <i>unique</i>, I guess.
5-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking,So if that's her stand doing that... what does her stand feel right now?
5-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,I wonder what her stand <i>would feel like</i>.
5-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=embarrassed,Is this normal? This doesn't really look normal?
5-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=thinking,Does Kizuna have a virus or something? I think I heard about one of those overtaking the police station or something...
5-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=thinking,Is this how people from the internet masturbate? I guess I never asked, huh...
5-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=shocked,What are you even <i>doing</i>, Kizuna!
5-female_masturbating,target:mia=angry,Why're you slowing down? You get wacked on the head or something?
5-female_masturbating,target:mia=smug,Keep it up, loser. I'm thinking about taking a victory lap.
5-female_masturbating,target:mia=happy,Don't forget to play around with your assets! They're your most memorable feature!
5-female_masturbating,target:mia=laugh,This probably isn't what Mia signed up for, but <i>I'm</i> having the time of my life.
5-female_masturbating,target:mia=thinking,<i>(I wonder if Mia's into face sitting? She certainly likes sticking her nose in other people's business.)</i>
5-female_masturbating,target:mia=laugh,Difficult-looking poker players stand in a formidable row. They mock you.
5-female_masturbating,target:miko=horny,It must be nice to have your partner with you.
5-female_masturbating,target:miko=embarrassed,People are doing years of paranormal studies and here I am watching a ghost <i>get it on...</i>
5-female_masturbating,target:miko=shocked,Is that one physically possible?
5-female_masturbating,target:miko=confident,Hmph. There's something <i>poetic</i> about doin' it with a ghost. Not that I know what it is.
5-female_masturbating,target:miko=angry,You mean I coulda just brought some guy if I wanted to!
5-female_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,That looks... kinda uncomfortable...
5-female_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,I <i>guess</i> if Navi's enjoying it...
5-female_masturbating,target:navi=smug,I'm playing a <i>fairy</i> at strip poker. I should've expected weird stuff.
5-female_masturbating,target:navi=laugh,You're totally into Navi, aren't you, ~player~?
5-female_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,Are people into this? Is it a culture thing? I doubt most americans like this... this... <i>you know...</i>

5-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=horny,Hear that, boys? Looks like Mia's a screamer.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=bored,I you two can wrap up the <i>lovey-dovey</i> stuff, you might realize that there's a game going on.
5-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=angry,Great job, Moon! Now we have to burn the whole place down.

-3-male_masturbating,filter:penis_envy,priority:0=laugh,I don't think ~name~ likes it when people bring up how <i>small</i> he is. Let's not mention it.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,Well, looks like the company who makes these things certainly has higher standards than Jin does.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin,marker:skirt1=cracker,I bet we could put a skirt on this bag and Jin would try to flirt with it.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,More people should take you up on that rice cracker thing. Or they should've when they had the chance.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin=cracker,Could someone show Jin their butt or something? It'll distract him long enough to let me finish this bag.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin=horny,Better finish soon, Jin. The bag's almost out of crackers.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin,marker:sauce1=cracker,Ever considered getting a dipping sauce for these things?
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin=calm,Normally I wouldn't be low enough to steal food, but it <i>was</i> just gonna sit there.
-3-male_masturbating,target:jin=angry,What? Like <i>he</i> was gonna go back and eat some of these when he finished. No chance!

-3-male_heavy_masturbating=shocked,Woah! ~name~ is really intense right now!
-3-male_finished_masturbating=laugh,Be glad you weren't wearing any clothes. We probably would've needed an incinerator otherwise.
-3-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed,It's going to take a while before you've cooled down from <i>that</i> one.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:jin=shocked,That can't be magic, can it!
-3-female_must_masturbate=bored,Had to happen eventually, that's fate.
-3-female_must_masturbate=horny,I suppose you already know what to do?

-3-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=bored,Just get your chair... Nobody needs to talk about this.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:croix=thinking,There's a protocol for this? What could possibly...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:franziska=smug,Too little, too late. You've lost again, Franziska.

-3-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=confident,So close and yet so far, Mia.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=thinking,Bringing along a friend?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:morrigan=calm,Nothing wrong with a brief partnership.

-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:innocent=thinking,Maybe you aren't as <i>pure as the white of my beret</i> as I thought.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:innocent=sad,It's a shame what circumstance can do to the innocent.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:short_hair=laugh,Look on the bright side, at least you don't have to tie your hair up
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:short_hair=laugh,Make sure your hair stays out of your face. Might get a little <i>wild</i>.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:uses_toy=confident,You bringing that only proves that you knew I would win.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:uses_toy=smug,Smart bringing a toy. I know it's sometimes frustrating to realize you lost.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:very_long_hair=calm,Try to keep your hair off the ground. I don't know how often they mop this place.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:very_long_hair=laugh,Try not to sit on your hair. There might be... unfortunate consequences.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=laugh,Now as a new human, you should listen to everything I say, so start building steam, with a grain of salt, of course.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:alpha=laugh,What does your soul feel like?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:catria=angry,You heard her, ~player~. She's already a loser, <i>she deserves a break from all the attention.</i>
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:croix=shocked,<i>Woah!</i> Were you planning this?

-3-female_start_masturbating,target:mavis=angry,<i>Mgrrrr...</i> Stop trying to show off and just get to it!
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:mia=smug,You do that, Mia. Fortunately, for me, watching you lose is already pleasure enough.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,Those vines! What was <i>in</i> that bean?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:penny=embarrassed,Just sh-shut up and start, l-loser. Y-yeah!
-3-female_masturbating=horny,It's all building up, ~name~. Until you have that <i>final breakdown</i>.
-3-female_masturbating=smug,I hope you don't mind an audience, ~name~, 'cause no one's leaving anytime soon.
-3-female_masturbating=laugh,I guess you have all the encouragement you need.
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed,Not so fast, ~name~, it's not good for your body.
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed,N-now don't stare, ~name~, I don't work well under pressure.
-3-female_masturbating=laugh,If you wanted a little more encouragement, you should've tried getting better at poker.
-3-female_masturbating=smug,Pop quiz, ~name~. Where are my eyes? I think this one might take you a few seconds.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,I mixed them up... again.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=thinking,I guess no one knows more about what spots to hit than <i>you</i>.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=calm,I hope someone here knows which one we were playing with.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=bored,<i>Just one more naked person to add into the mix.</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:franziska=confident,It feels too good watching <i>Miss Perfect</i> already be out.
-3-female_masturbating,target:franziska=angry,Watch the whip! Don't get that thing near me!
-3-female_masturbating,target:franziska=laugh,Keep it up, loser. I'm enjoying myself, for once!
-3-female_masturbating,target:franziska=smug,Tsk tsk tsk. Look at you, Franziska. You're enjoying every second of this, aren't you?
-3-female_masturbating,target:franziska=thinking,<i>(Now... what place should I say she should shove her riding crop into?</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:franziska,targetSaidMarker:mimi,notSaidMarker:mimi_reply,marker:mimi_reply=bored,Y'know, I would, but I also kinda hate you... Hard pass.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=bored,I lied about this being interesting. She's just <i>kneeling</i> there.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=smug,You wanna... use your hands, Jolyne?
-3-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking,I guess this is the power of a stand. It's <i>unique</i>, I guess.
-3-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking,So if that's her stand doing that... what does her stand feel right now?
-3-female_masturbating,target:jolyne=horny,I wonder what her stand <i>would feel like</i>.
-3-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=embarrassed,Is this normal? This doesn't really look normal?
-3-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=thinking,Does Kizuna have a virus or something? I think I heard about one of those overtaking the police station or something...
-3-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=thinking,Is this how people from the internet masturbate? I guess I never asked, huh...
-3-female_masturbating,target:kizuna=shocked,What are you even <i>doing</i>, Kizuna!
-3-female_masturbating,target:mia=angry,Why're you slowing down? You get wacked on the head or something?
-3-female_masturbating,target:mia=smug,Keep it up, loser. I'm thinking about taking a victory lap.
-3-female_masturbating,target:mia=happy,Don't forget to play around with your assets! They're your most memorable feature!
-3-female_masturbating,target:mia=laugh,This probably isn't what Mia signed up for, but <i>I'm</i> having the time of my life.
-3-female_masturbating,target:mia=thinking,<i>(I wonder if Mia's into face sitting? She certainly likes sticking her nose in other people's business.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:mia=laugh,Difficult-looking poker players stand in a formidable row. They mock you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:miko=horny,It must be nice to have your partner with you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:miko=embarrassed,People are doing years of paranormal studies and here I am watching a ghost <i>get it on...</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:miko=shocked,Is that one physically possible?
-3-female_masturbating,target:miko=confident,Hmph. There's something <i>poetic</i> about doin' it with a ghost. Not that I know what it is.
-3-female_masturbating,target:miko=angry,You mean I coulda just brought some guy if I wanted to!
-3-female_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,That looks... kinda uncomfortable...
-3-female_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,I <i>guess</i> if Navi's enjoying it...
-3-female_masturbating,target:navi=smug,I'm playing a <i>fairy</i> at strip poker. I should've expected weird stuff.
-3-female_masturbating,target:navi=laugh,You're totally into Navi, aren't you, ~player~?
-3-female_masturbating,target:navi=embarrassed,Are people into this? Is it a culture thing? I doubt most americans like this... this... <i>you know...</i>
-3-female_heavy_masturbating=sad,<i>(Why do I feel weird? She's so... attractive.)</i>
-3-female_heavy_masturbating=laugh,Finish and become the loser I always knew you were!
-3-female_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed,I... just can't stop staring...
-3-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Woah! Guess we're not dealing with an amateur here.
-3-female_finished_masturbating=happy,No hiding there!
-3-female_finished_masturbating=horny,That's quite a breakdown...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:nagisa,targetNotSaidMarker:nagisa_finished_1,notSaidMarker:dealcut,count-nagisa_valentine:0,marker:dealcut=confident,Yeah, I'll forget what I saw today, but you have to do the same thing for me.

-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=laugh,Finally! Looks like it's all over for you, Mia.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=horny,Hear that, boys? Looks like Mia's a screamer.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko=bored,I you two can wrap up the <i>lovey-dovey</i> stuff, you might realize that there's a game going on.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:moon=angry,Great job, Moon! Now we have to burn the whole place down.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-1-finished_masturbating=adjust,I think I might have to buy a new hat after this.
-1-finished_masturbating=smug,On the bright side, I get to keep something to cover myself with if I feel like it, unlike you dorks.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,timeInStage:0=embarrassed,You wouldn't happen to have a spare hand floating around, would you, Elizabeth?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,timeInStage:0=embarrassed,I can't believe she gets people to cover her up...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,timeInStage:0=angry,Why don't <i>I</i> get a fan or something to cover up with!?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:elizabeth,alsoPlayingStage:10,timeInStage:0=laugh,You really overwork those other dimension yous, Elizabeth. Maybe they should help someone closer to the ground?
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jolyne,alsoPlayingStage:0-3,timeInStage:0=adjust,Defeat... Whatever, Jolyne, I'm sure you could probably save yourself a round if you took those bun covers off of that seaweed wrap you call hair.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:jolyne,alsoPlayingStage:4-5,timeInStage:0=adjust,Can it, Jolyne. I may have forgotten my hat, but <i>you</i> forgot something even more important.
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,timeInStage:0=adjust,Yeah, yeah... I get the picture, I lost again, you haven't...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:7,timeInStage:0=adjust,I guess it is finally lights out...
-1-finished_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia,alsoPlayingStage:8,timeInStage:0=adjust,Guess there's nothing I can do now...

-1-finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive:2=smug,Am I supposed to root for one of these losers to win?
-1-finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive:2=bored,Yeah... go... I dunno. ~player~ if you're still in this...
-1-finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive:2=adjust,I'm sure once the last of you losers falls you'll say something like, "can't you be an asshole somewhere else?" And I'll say "No, 'cause I was here first".
-1-finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive:2=angry,You better not screw this up and make me look bad!
-1-finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive:2=smug,You probably don't want me supporting you, anyways. <i>Apparently</i>, I'm no good in teams.
-1-finished_masturbating,priority:0,count-alive:2=sad,Yeah, yeah... I'm still watching you guys play...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,priority:800,count-flower_girl_ini:1-5,marker:breakdown=adjust,Guess my braid came a little loose there...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,priority:800,count-flower_girl_ini:1-5,marker:breakdown=adjust,I didn't expect to breakdown that much... my braid came loose...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,test:~background~:beach,marker:breakdown=adjust,Can I wash off in the water back there? It's kinda sandy down here...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,test:~background~:poolside,marker:breakdown=adjust,Now, I don't suppose I could <i>wash off</i> in the pool, could I?
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,test:~background~:roof,marker:breakdown=adjust,I'm actually just kinda glad that my hat didn't get blown off the roof. I'm kinda getting attached to it...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,marker:breakdown=adjust,Guess I had a little breakdown there...
-1-finished_masturbating,timeInStage:0,notSaidMarker:breakdown,marker:breakdown=adjust,Well... I guess I got my hat back...

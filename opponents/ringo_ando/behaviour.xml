                <state img="#-heh.png">The fact that I have no clue if this is enough is kind of exciting you know?</state>
                <state img="#-heh.png">This is like blindly throwing a medium combo to your rival without checking what they have prepared themselves.</state>
                <state img="#-glad.png">I know this may not be the best combo, but it should get me through this hand.</state>
                <state img="#-glad.png">A challenge to win, maybe? Maybe not!</state>
                <state img="#-balanceapple.png">While not amazing, the odds are still on my favor this time around.</state>

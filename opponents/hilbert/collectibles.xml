        <text>It's an X-Transceiver, Unova's hottest new mode of communication! Hilbert gifted you this as a way to keep in touch with him; He's even put his number in already!

...Unfortunately he didn't give you a charger, and the battery's dead.</text>

        <text>The legendary Light Stone, said to be where the great Dragon of Truth, Reshiram rested when it was without physical form. Even now, you can still feel a faint power radiating from within...

...Or you would, if this were the real thing and not a replica.</text>
        <unlock>Trigger Hilbert's 'Serious Business' mode, then win against him as your last opponent while you're both nude.</unlock>

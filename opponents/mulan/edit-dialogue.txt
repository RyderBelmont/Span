#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-,This is what the character says after they've been selected if the new triggers aren't used


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

0-selected=challenge,Hi there! I’m Ping. This is where the game’s being played, right?
0-selected=challenge,Hi. I'm... Ping! Let's uh... let's get down to business, shall we?
0-game_start=joy,I’ve played a lot of cards when we were snowed in near the Tung Shao Pass. This’ll be easier than dumplings.
0-game_start=smirk,Nothing manlier than getting naked and gambling…
0-game_start,alsoPlaying:jasmine=pinged,Huh… An anonymous girl… she seems… familiar.
0-game_start,alsoPlaying:navi=pinged,A spirit guide? Hm. I'm used to Mushu... but Navi seems like she'd be helpful here.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=joy,This’s much easier without all my armor. ~cards~.
swap_cards=challenge,Just ~cards~.

okay_hand=joy,This'll do.
okay_hand=chuckle,Oh, you're all in for it now!
okay_hand=peace,Reflect before you act. This shall bring you glory and honor.
bad_hand=dishonor,Honor’s <i>very</i> important. So, I’ll go ahead and admit this hand’s pretty much slop.
bad_hand=denial,<i>Tsk.</i> And here I was, thinking myself so clever. I can fold, right? This hand, I mean. Obviously, any civilized person can do their own laundry...
bad_hand=yikes,Well, at least I have nothing left to hide. Except my body. That I can hide.

-3-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:drinks_anyone,notSaidMarker:sei_drinks,marker:sei_drinks=smirk,I'll take you up on that drink, Sei. Can I have that "Mulan Tea," if you'd be so kind? It sounds wonderful.

-3-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:sei,saidMarker:duel_lost,notSaidMarker:duel_sei_lost,marker:duel_sei_lost=chuckle,Well, from behind, yes, Sei, it has. Or at a brothel, you'd be surprised. I've had many pleasant encounters.
-3-bad_hand,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:duel_lost,notSaidMarker:duel_pit,marker:duel_pit=challenge,I fought a powerful warlord named Shan-yu, Pit. His Horde tried to destroy my capital! After a long duel, my wits overwhelmed him, and I took home his sword as a trophy.

0-must_strip_winning=denial,<i>Spits.</i> Calling me a woman because I lost one hand? Aren’t you a forward-minded bunch. Clearly, I’m a big strong man with my sword and my armor.

0-must_strip_normal=interested,What, because I don’t have facial hair, I’m a girl now? Well, I’ll show you what’s what next hand.
0-must_strip_normal=yikes,I know I lost the hand, but it’s <i>rude</i> to insult me by calling me a woman just because of it. I’ll have you know some of the best game players I know are women.

#losing armor
1-stripped=stripped,Was that phallic and manly enough for all of you, or do I need to get more overt with the fart and dick jokes?
1-stripped=stripped,Was that sufficiently gross and manly? Come on, dealer, let’s show the rest of them not to mess with Fa Ping.


#losing bracers
0-stripping=stripping,I’ve got a soft spot for wrists. Once, I used my big, throbbing man-brain to climb a pole with them. So, keeping a hard guard on my wrists just makes sense.


#losing armor
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,And I'm <i>clearly</i> not girlishly built! Why! I'm not girly at all. I'm a big strong man. Obviously. right, Catria?


#losing bracers
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,That's an easy one, even a wrong idiot like you should be able to grasp it. Blood flows from one head to the other.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1-7=stripping,Dealer, should we give Meia her eyeglass back? She seems to have a hard time telling the difference between a man and a woman.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0=stripping,I'm impressed. Even with your one eyeglass, you can't tell the difference between a man and a woman, Meia.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jasmine=stripping,Remember to be charming, <i>Miss</i>. Princesses have an image to keep!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Heh. You got me there, Catria. No Pegasi, but some yaoguai and dragons and ghosts.


#losing armor
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jasmine=stripped,Don't worry. We just remind each other of charming old friends. Eh. Heheh.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=stripped,Then it becomes really important to stick it somewhere tight, warm, and wet. You'd do, Jura. You'd do well with men. Like, me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:miko=stripped,No need to be rude, Prince. I know you have a divine right and all that.
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I’m shocked you all figured it out so fast. That costume’s fooled… well, probably a lot more people than it ought to.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:revy=must_strip,Oh, yes, please, do comment on my appearance, while yours is stained with inks of low reputation!
1-must_strip_normal=must_strip,Fine, fine, let’s let me not make a big deal over a little deal, like you’re all about to.
1-must_strip_normal=must_strip,There’s no <i>Wei</i> I should’ve lost that hand… but keeping up appearances forever is <i>girly</i>. Actually, let me just...
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:revy=must_strip,Oh, yes, please, do comment on my appearance, while yours is stained with inks of low reputation!
1-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Quit it with all the girl and lady comments… <i>Feh</i>.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:revy=must_strip,Oh, yes, please, do comment on my appearance, while yours is stained with inks of low reputation!
1-stripping=stripping,<i>Sigh</i>. I suppose the ploy’s over. Hope you’re all happy.


#losing shoes
2-stripped=stripped,I’d quote Sun Tzu about knowing yourself and keeping your opponents off-guard, but that seems a little too...
2-stripped=stripped,I’m not ashamed of being a woman, or anything. Sometimes it’s just good form to make a strong first impression. You'd best prepare yourselves.
2-stripped=stripped,You’ve gotten me out of my armor. Now I’m going to get you out of the rest of… your stuff. All of it, so get ready!


#losing armor
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jasmine,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=stripping,<i>Sigh.</i> I thought it was going pretty well, <i>Jasmine</i>.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:cammy=stripping,So it seems, Cammy... I thought the ruse would've worked better.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:revy=stripping,I’ve fought bigger villains than you, and routed armies.


#losing shoes
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ini,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,I'm glad it fooled <i>Ini,</i>. What an embarassment that could've been.


#losing armor
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:jasmine,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=stripping,Yes! Everyone should be suprised! It's a very effective disguise!


#losing shoes
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:revy=stripped,You don’t scare me any more than your little cannons do, Revy.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,<i>I</i> appreciate that it at least fooled Catria. Thanks for humoring me, my blue-haired Pegasus Knight.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=stripped,Aww, you were so into it, Misato. You still <i>could</i> be.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jotaro=stripped,I did really like that you were so quick to defend my honor, Jotaro.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ini,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=stripped,At least one of us had a good disguise, <i>Ini.</i>
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Ah, no, Pit. You were very respectful. Don't change a thing. Except your clothes. Those have to go.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:cammy=stripped,I will, Cammy, just give me a moment. It's nice to stretch out a bit.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:haru=stripped,Well, Haru, I appreciate that. But I'm a little miffed the disguise wasn't better.
2-must_strip_winning=interested,I’m no Captain Shang. I’m not going to be whipping you into shape, but I hope you realize that I’m winning, and that motivates you to assess yourselves.
2-must_strip_normal=yikes,Dang! I thought I was doing so well! At least I have quite a few layers left. Perks of elaborate styles, I suppose.
2-must_strip_normal=peace,I’ll hold onto the sword for a while longer. I’m fine with my hands, but I think you get my <i>point</i> better when I’m visibly armed.
2-must_strip_losing=challenge,And here I was, worried you’d start taking it easy on me for being a woman. I appreciate the respect!
2-stripping=stripping,I’ll just kick these off…
2-stripping,marker:shoes_indoors=stripping,...It’s normally pretty rude to wear shoes indoors. Don’t believe everything you hear about me, though.


#losing sash
3-stripped=stripped,The floor is so cold! Good thing I’ve gotten used to cold lakes and early morning bathing, I suppose.


#losing shoes
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:weaponryyy,totalRounds:0-7=stripping,If it helps, Ryuji, I will be keeping my sword for quite some time. I bet you'll have a grip on yours soon.


#losing sash
3-stripped,saidMarker:shoes_indoors=stripped,I wore some modern shoes to Aurora’s the <i>one</i> time someone decides to film for a new Princess applicant. Aurora’s carpet is filthy, I’ll have you know.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,The floor is so cold, like an early morning bath... Oh um. Yes, Pit, but they're quite rare, or too hot!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia,saidMarker:shoes_indoors=stripped,I wore some modern shoes the <i>one</i> time we had a princess applicant-- and why, yes, how else would you do it, Mia?
3-must_strip_winning=joy,I really liked how I was playing. Didn’t you? Time for something small that ends up showing quite a bit...
3-must_strip_normal=interested,I think the stuff you work for ends up being the work that’s most impressive. But, you <i>did</i> already get me out of my armor… and my disguise.
3-must_strip_normal=challenge,Hmm… I suppose you’re expecting my sword by now… don’t worry, I’m not going to do any fancy tricks with it, but I’m still not really interested in parting with it just yet.
3-must_strip_losing=yikes,I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to show a <i>little</i> leg… or whatever does it for you. It’s a little flattering you’re trying to hard to beat me. Or maybe you’re mad I tricked you earlier. Either way…


#losing vest and sword
4-stripped=stripped,Is it hard to take me seriously with my clothes like this? Lots of Xia fight in stuff that's more flowy. So the stories go. What’s this but another story?


#losing sash
3-stripping=stripping,Don’t worry, I’m not going to stop being <i>sash</i>-y.


#losing vest and sword
4-must_strip_winning=peace,Not to brag, but if this is your best… maybe you should train a little harder.
4-must_strip_normal=joy,I’m determined not to lose, but it’s enjoyable to see so much variety here. When I spend time with the other “Princesses,” it’s… a fair bit more predictable.
4-must_strip_normal=denial,I concede with all the grace and honor expected of me.
4-must_strip_losing,marker:recount=dishonor,Respectfully, I want the dealer to re-examine that hand...
4-stripping=stripping,My vest is sort of just hanging on...
4-stripping=stripping,I'll part with my sword. My vest is also just hanging on...


#losing dress
5-stripped=stripped,...but I’m not. I’m very much enjoying the competition. Victory is sweeter when it’s nabbed from the jaws of defeat, or low expectations. I’m not through yet.
5-stripped=stripped,I may have parted with my sword, but I’m not disarmed just yet! Awfully chilly in here…
5-stripped=stripped,...but I’m not. I’m very much enjoying the competition. Victory is sweeter when low expectations are overcome. I’ve barely even started!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,I think you mentioned something about a lance. I'll admit, I'm quite good with... staves... you know, take that how you will.


#losing vest and sword
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Well, here's my vest, and my blade... I'll have you know, Catria, I'm quite skilled with that weapon! I wouldn't ever hurt someone with it in a game like this!


#losing dress
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,My robe’s getting a little stuffy. I suppose this’s been what you’ve been waiting for…
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip,While I’d rather this be in more private quarters, I suppose rules are rules… I’ll take off the leggings as well.
5-must_strip_normal=must_strip,A dress <i>and</i> leggings. I hope this’s enough to smooth over any hurt feelings.
5-must_strip_losing=must_strip,Yes, I am wearing underwear, I’m not a barbarian.


#losing wraps
6-stripped=stripped,One gets used to bindings like this. They’re silk, and actually quite comfortable! I’d wear a bra if I weren’t coming from my own world, though. Makes the girls look a little nicer.


#losing dress
5-stripping=stripping,Just give me a moment.


#losing wraps
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Ah, I'm sorry, Catria, but this is just all part of the outfit I brought for tonight. I thought the silk was at least flattering!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia=stripped,Well, of course. One gets used to silk bindings. They make the girls look good too, Mia.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Of course not, Pit! They're just red silk. When it comes to swordsmanship, I don't like to paint my own clothes red.
6-must_strip_winning=joy,I hope it’s obvious that only a few people have actually seen me naked, but forgive me if I don’t act like a bashful girl on her wedding night. If I didn’t plan for this, why would I have shown up in full armor?
6-must_strip_normal,marker:foodstuff=dishonor,I’m not very… jiggly. Like <i>some</i>. You’ll find me less like a dumpling and more like a lean cut of-- you know, I’m not comparing myself to a piece of meat, and you shouldn’t either.
6-must_strip_normal,marker:foodstuff=interested,I’m certainly glad I opted against Belle and Anna’s advice. Corsets and the like just… ah, “push the meat to the top of the pie.” Somewhat hard to do when you’re mostly muscle.
6-must_strip_losing=yikes,You’re all certainly eager to see me naked… I hope I haven’t wronged you too greatly to unite you all against me like this...


#losing underwear
7-stripped=stripped,...though, I do hope they’re not <i>too</i> boyish.


#losing wraps
6-stripping=stripping,I have a warrior’s chest. If that weren’t the case, why be a warrior? There’s plenty of honor and a great amount of dignity in accepting your station, but I aspire to be more than that.
6-stripping=stripping,I’m proud of what I have, though I’m greater than their… sum....


#losing underwear
7-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,If I ever visit your world, I'd certainly give it a chance, Catria. I appreciate your confidence!
7-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia=stripped,...I hope they're not <i>too</i> boyish. Thanks, Mia! If you're free later, I have some other games I could teach you...
7-must_strip_winning=peace,I know I’ve done quite a few bluffs and deceptions, and I apologize. But I’m being honest when I say at this stage, I’m looking forward to joining the rest of you.
7-must_strip_normal=interested,Well, I’ve put the name of my family on the line before… but if a soldier doesn’t enjoy him or herself when off duty, how can they know when to fight important battles?
7-must_strip_normal=challenge,This has been quite the challenge. Well-played, but I <i>do</i> have one more hand at the very least… until I resort to <i>my</i> hand, I suppose.
7-must_strip_losing=surprise,Lesson learned, you all really like tomboys, or my performance offended you. Weird how those go hand in hand… kind of like how I’m about to have a hand in myself…
7-must_strip_losing=yikes,Lesson learned, I annoyed you by pretending to be a boy, or you just like masculine women. Weird how those go hand in hand… kind of like how I’m about to have a hand in myself…
7-stripping=stripping,I’m going to look you in the eyes while I do this. This may be a defeat, but <i>I’m</i> not defeated, and I won’t yield or start acting coy simply because I’m in my own skin.

-3-stripped=stripped,At the very least, I won’t be the first if I do lose. I don’t mind being exceptional, truly. But I would prefer to have fought to the bitter end.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=challenge,Hades? I think Meg knows that guy. With the big flaming eyebrows? Kind of a jerk? I'd like to give him a piece of my sword!
-3-stripped,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=stripped,There’s no shame in an honest loss. Though, the next part… that can be a little shameful if I’m first to lose.
-3-stripped,saidMarker:mulan_duel,notSaidMarker:challenge_answer,priority:990,marker:duel_lost=stripped,Well… it would be rude to not answer, given that I’m the one that started the challenge. Go ahead, everyone. I will answer honestly and without shame, I promise.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-female_removed_accessory=denial,So, let’s see what’s next, right? ~clothing~? Seriously. Who wears ~Clothing~ when you could show up in a full set of armor?
0-female_removed_accessory=smirk,I guess a <i>fair</i> and chivalrous maiden like ~name~ would part with her ~clothing~ rather than expose herself to a rowdy crowd like this. <i>Heh!</i>
0-female_removed_accessory=denial,I was just checking out her ~clothing~... Uh, checking ~name~ out. Like a guys-guy would do.
0-female_removed_accessory,marker:suspicious_denial=denial,If I were a woman, I’d try something like that. If I were. Which I’m not.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=surprise,Because, uh, you’re big and strong. And everyone probably wants to climb on top. Eheh. Quite the jokester, I am, and not the first time you’ve heard it, I’m sure.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,That’s something, I guess. <i>Though I can’t ever imagine that being something we’d need in my Kingdom.</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=surprise,Just have to make sure to keep the men and women separate, right? Would be a real shame if that got mixed up.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,totalFemales:5=challenge,I don't know about that, Elizabeth. I certainly understand!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=surprise,How do I know that? Well, uh, obviously, as a xia, I'm duty-bound to protect princesses.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=challenge,Unlike myself, of course. I prefer my manly, heavy armor.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=challenge,I’m impressed. Especially as a man, for a woman to do that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.

2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!

2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
2-female_removed_accessory,notSaidMarker:roster_admit,marker:roster_admit=chuckle,It’s actually quite a challenge to get on the roster as a woman. I suppose I appreciate you not going easy on me.

5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=dishonor,It's not a challenge, or anything. I was just... a little jealous.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.

5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=joy,And a pilot…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
5-female_removed_accessory,notSaidMarker:roster_admit,marker:roster_admit=chuckle,It’s actually quite a challenge to get on the roster as a woman. I suppose I appreciate you not going easy on me.

7-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...

-3-male_removing_accessory=surprise,I’m normally a fast learner. How long have you been playing cards?
-3-male_removing_accessory=surprise,You still had your ~clothing~? I don’t even have ~clothing~ like that where I’m from!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
-3-male_removed_accessory=yikes,It’s humbling to see you still so equipped. At least you showed up ready to win, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_accessory=dishonor,Wow, ~name~. Taking a victory lap already? You’ve earned it, anyway.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=dishonor,It's not a challenge, or anything. I was just... a little jealous.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
-3-female_removing_accessory=denial,There’s really no need to be a sore winner.
-3-female_removing_accessory=interested,This has been a fun way to get to know each other.
-3-female_removing_accessory=surprise,Your ~clothing~? You’re going to have to teach me that one.
-3-female_removing_accessory=joy,A flowing stream smoothes all edges.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0=yikes,Maybe taking off your weapon first is good form for a game like this... I hope keeping mine as long as I did wasn't rude.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=joy,And a pilot…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
-3-female_removed_accessory=interested,Next time, let’s do strip arm wrestling… that’s… uh, definitely a thing.
-3-female_removed_accessory=dishonor,Ai-yah! You aren’t even layering big things, ~name~!
-3-female_removed_accessory=peace,It’s cute. Your ~clothing~. I mean, you too, truth be told.
-3-female_removed_accessory=yikes,You aren’t seriously expecting me to beg for mercy? I <i>will</i> offer you a firm handshake for luck, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.

-1-female_removing_accessory=denial,You didn’t seriously save your ~clothing~ until now?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0=yikes,Maybe taking off your weapon first is good form for a game like this... I hope keeping mine as long as I did wasn't rude.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=joy,And a pilot…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
-1-female_removed_accessory=surprise,<i>Ai-yah</i>! I was out of my league!
-1-female_removed_accessory=surprise,I’d say I was out of my depth, but I just… was in my depth, you know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.

0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... the pattern on your pants remind me of my friend Merida!
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=joy,Honestly, not much of my clothing ends up being tailored to me.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=chuckle,It reminds me of a man I once knew, named Sora.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=joy,You seem... very normal, all told.
0-male_removed_minor=interested,Nice ~clothing~. Looks good on the floor, though. Covered in dirt, like men like us do. After long battles and training in mud. Heh-heh.
0-male_removed_minor=peace,I know men are supposed to be as swift as a coursing river, but why don’t you hold back a little, ~name~, really let the ladies enjoy a big, strong guy removing his ~clothing~?
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=dishonor,Are you certain you don't know any of these people? Hm. I suppose the world is a large enough place...
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=surprise,It's hard not to stare. You're so striking!
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=interested,I would want to keep something like that in good condition, personally.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smirk,I imagine the two of you would get along well!
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=surprise,Oh, no, Pit. Nothing at all. Only master warriors tend to wear white, since they can avoid getting dirt or blood on it. Impressive.
0-female_removing_minor=challenge,<i>Finally</i>, something big. Or, as big as ~clothing~ can be.
0-female_removing_minor=joy,Not too big, not too small, without your ~clothing~, you'll bring honor to us all, ~name~. Aw, it's from a song.
0-female_removing_minor=smirk,Not bad, ~name~, but I'm going to want to see more before I take off my armor. Uh, that's reasonable, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, your gloves? I... tend to like wrists.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=dishonor,I suppose if you're here to bond with someone, you would want to be fast about it...
0-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=smirk,Purple hair, a matching outfit…
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=peace,I see woman everywhere like lots of layers... I'm surprised your outfit is so... drab.
0-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=smirk,I'm a fan of the sash, and your outfit. Loose, flowing clothes are <i>so</i> much better than heavy armor...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of... attire a woman I knew wore.
0-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=dishonor,I'm surprised you gave up your wand so quickly, Lotte.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=chuckle,Of <i>course</i> you can't sit out the next few rounds, Catria.

0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.
0-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=peace,It's obvious you're quite a skilled warrior... but why not be honorable?
0-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=chuckle,♩ Don't be so shy-- ♩
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=chuckle,You are <i>such</i> a sweet one, Sayori.
0-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...
0-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,count-jasmine:1=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of Princess Jasmine's, in some of her outfits.
0-female_removed_minor=interested,You look good without your ~clothing~. Though you looked good with it. Definitely liking this better, though.
0-female_removed_minor=joy,Uh, don’t feel compelled to rush, ~name~. Some people like a more measured pace too… like, uh, with foreplay! Not all men want to just rush into it. Some like to enjoy the experience!
0-female_removed_minor=surprise,Phew. ~name~, looking <i>great</i> even without her ~clothing~.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=smirk,I think putting your clothes back on is cheating... but I'm sure ~player~ could keep you warm.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
0-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=dishonor,You uh, say my name with so <i>much</i> confidence.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=joy,Your eyes, ribbons, and hair are so exotic! I'm surprised you dress in such earthy tones, Sayori.
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=surprise,W-who is this, Crown Prince?
0-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=chuckle,Keeping your composure is important, but, really, why not consider fighting for justice rather than evil?
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=joy,I'm actually quite fascinated. I would be interested to see how your quartermaster prepares equipment like that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=smirk,Oh? <i>Furs</i>? Now, I'm not a stranger to army humor. I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean, Catria. I guess we'll see <i>your</i> fur in a few hands.

0-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0=surprise,Oh! Yes. Absolutely no lecherous thoughts, Elizabeth. None. Whatsoever.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=denial,They're very useful, if you know how to use them! They say a lot about a person. Catria's very strong, but also delicate. These are good traits in a woman. So I hear.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=surprise,Oh. I'm sorry if I was staring. You can just tell a lot about someone by their wrists.
0-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=denial,You know, I always figure you have to be smaller than your armor... but your chest is... it's dangerous to have oversized equipment. Trust me on this.

0-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.

2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=joy,Honestly, not much of my clothing ends up being tailored to me.
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=chuckle,It reminds me of a man I once knew, named Sora.

2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=interested,I would want to keep something like that in good condition, personally.

2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=surprise,Oh, no, Pit. Nothing at all. Only master warriors tend to wear white, since they can avoid getting dirt or blood on it. Impressive.
2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=peace,It's obvious you're quite a skilled warrior... but why not be honorable?
2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.

2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...

2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=interested,Most of the Princesses I know who use magic don't use it to show off...
2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=peace,I see woman everywhere like lots of layers... I'm surprised your outfit is so... drab.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=chuckle,You are <i>such</i> a sweet one, Sayori.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,I’ve got a lot of respect for a woman who’s willing to go out into the world and fight for a cause she respects and people she loves.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=dishonor,I suppose if you're here to bond with someone, you would want to be fast about it...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=smirk,I'm a fan of the sash, and your outfit. Loose, flowing clothes are <i>so</i> much better than heavy armor...

2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=chuckle,Of <i>course</i> you can't sit out the next few rounds, Catria.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of... attire a woman I knew wore.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=smirk,Purple hair, a matching outfit…
2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, your gloves? I... tend to like wrists.

2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.
2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=challenge,Are you a Princess of some sort? You certainly carry yourself like one, I bet.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=chuckle,Well, if you <i>aren't</i> a princess, I suppose you wouldn't mind <i>getting to know</i> a commoner like me, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2=chuckle,Keeping your composure is important, but, really, why not consider fighting for justice rather than evil?

2-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=chuckle,<i>Haha,</i> take a joke, Miss.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=yikes,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=yikes,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=denial,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=surprise,W-who is this, Crown Prince?
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=denial,They're very useful, if you know how to use them! They say a lot about a person. Catria's very strong, but also delicate. These are good traits in a woman. So I hear.
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=surprise,Oh. I'm sorry if I was staring. You can just tell a lot about someone by their wrists.

2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=denial,You know, I always figure you have to be smaller than your armor... but your chest is... it's dangerous to have oversized equipment. Trust me on this.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=challenge,I find it… relatable.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=joy,I'm actually quite fascinated. I would be interested to see how your quartermaster prepares equipment like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=peace,I'm happy you're having fun, but surely a little magic would've helped your odds...?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,totalNaked:1,priority:990,marker:ai_duel=challenge,Ai-chan, you lost the bet! Are you truly that oblivious, or is this all an act? You are aware you aren't the player, right?

6-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... the pattern on your pants remind me of my friend Merida!
6-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=chuckle,It reminds me of a man I once knew, named Sora.

6-male_removed_minor=challenge,Considering what I’m <i>not</i> wearing, I wouldn’t mind trying on ~name~’s ~clothing after this. Has to be more comfortable than armor, anyway.
6-male_removed_minor=challenge,~name~, your ~clothing~’s working somewhat like armor: a relief to get you out of, but something that protected you.

6-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=chuckle,<i>Haha,</i> take a joke, Miss.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=yikes,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=yikes,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=denial,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=smirk,Oh? <i>Furs</i>? Now, I'm not a stranger to army humor. I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean, Catria. I guess we'll see <i>your</i> fur in a few hands.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=chuckle,Well, if you <i>aren't</i> a princess, I suppose you wouldn't mind <i>getting to know</i> a commoner like me, right?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=denial,You know, I always figure you have to be smaller than your armor... but your chest is... it's dangerous to have oversized equipment. Trust me on this.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=challenge,Are you a Princess of some sort? You certainly carry yourself like one, I bet.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=denial,They're very useful, if you know how to use them! They say a lot about a person. Catria's very strong, but also delicate. These are good traits in a woman. So I hear.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=surprise,Oh. I'm sorry if I was staring. You can just tell a lot about someone by their wrists.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.

-2-male_removing_minor=interested,Just ~clothing~?
-2-male_removing_minor=peace,A little bigger than your ~clothing~ would’ve been nice...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Hm... the pattern on your pants remind me of my friend Merida!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=chuckle,It reminds me of a man I once knew, named Sora.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=joy,You seem... very normal, all told.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=joy,Honestly, not much of my clothing ends up being tailored to me.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=chuckle,You can't seriously keep up the serious facade the whole game, can you?
-2-male_removed_minor=peace,S-still, better by inches.
-2-male_removed_minor=joy,A-ah, there we go.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=dishonor,Are you certain you don't know any of these people? Hm. I suppose the world is a large enough place...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=smirk,I imagine the two of you would get along well!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=surprise,Oh, no, Pit. Nothing at all. Only master warriors tend to wear white, since they can avoid getting dirt or blood on it. Impressive.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=interested,I would want to keep something like that in good condition, personally.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=surprise,It's hard not to stare. You're so striking!
-2-female_removing_minor=interested,A little bigger than your ~clothing~ would’ve been nice...
-2-female_removing_minor=peace,Just ~clothing~?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0=chuckle,♩ Don't be so shy-- ♩
-2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2=chuckle,Of <i>course</i> you can't sit out the next few rounds, Catria.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,I’ve got a lot of respect for a woman who’s willing to go out into the world and fight for a cause she respects and people she loves.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,count-jasmine:1=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of Princess Jasmine's, in some of her outfits.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=yikes,<i>Ai-yah!</i> A spirit?! You truly must be a powerful Taoist magician indeed!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=peace,It's obvious you're quite a skilled warrior... but why not be honorable?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=smirk,Purple hair, a matching outfit…
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2=dishonor,I suppose if you're here to bond with someone, you would want to be fast about it...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2=smirk,I'm a fan of the sash, and your outfit. Loose, flowing clothes are <i>so</i> much better than heavy armor...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=peace,I see woman everywhere like lots of layers... I'm surprised your outfit is so... drab.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=chuckle,You are <i>such</i> a sweet one, Sayori.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1=interested,Oh, your gloves? I... tend to like wrists.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of... attire a woman I knew wore.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1=interested,Most of the Princesses I know who use magic don't use it to show off...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=dishonor,I'm surprised you gave up your wand so quickly, Lotte.
-2-female_removed_minor=joy,A-ah, there we go.
-2-female_removed_minor=peace,S-still, better by inches.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=peace,I'm happy you're having fun, but surely a little magic would've helped your odds...?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee=denial,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=smirk,I think putting your clothes back on is cheating... but I'm sure ~player~ could keep you warm.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major=challenge,I hope it was worth it, ~name~!
male_removing_major=challenge,Sloppy play, ~name~.
male_removed_major=interested,It's important to enjoy the little things in life. But I think it's worth savoring the big ones too. Like your ~clothing~, ~name~.
male_removed_major=interested,I'm just impressed you can keep pace with me. Any other contests you think you want me to beat you at?
male_removed_major=joy,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure some nice woman will make a great househusband of you yet.
female_removing_major=challenge,Now <i>~name~</i> is a woman worth fighting for.
female_removing_major=interested,All’s fair in poker and war, ~name~.
female_removing_major=surprise,So, ~name~... are you at all interested in women? A friend wants to know.
female_removed_major=yikes,Sorry you had to lose, but sometimes you just got to go for the throat! Even--especially--in friendly games of chance!
female_removed_major=surprise,Like a lotus blossom. Soft, and refined!
female_removed_major=interested,Let's keep this up! It's so fun to gamble with other women.


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=joy,Makes sense, big strong guy like ~name~, making big strong plays like his ~clothing~!
0-male_removing_major=dishonor,If I were in your ~clothing~, I’d have taken off two by now.
0-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
0-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=challenge,Glad to see you aren't a pushover, Jotaro.
0-male_removed_major=yikes,See, have a little courage, like ~name~. Taking off ~clothing~ in a game like this is obviously the right play. You know, for the rest of us, eh?
0-male_removed_major=challenge,Oh, just your ~clothing~? Well when it’s my turn, I’d take-- uh, I’d take off something even bigger.
0-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
0-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
0-female_removing_major=surprise,Your ~clothing~ was gorgeous, ~name~... uh, what I mean to say is...
0-female_removing_major=chuckle,Fa Ping is one of the most versatile soldiers you’ll meet! I can compliment ~name~ on her ~clothing~ and enjoy whatever she had beneath it.
0-female_removing_major=challenge,I admire a woman who can keep a brave face, even during something challenging…
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0=chuckle,Uh... I'm right here, Elizabeth. Not that you should be embarassed I'm a lad-- a lad! A gentleman, though.
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
0-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=yikes,My eyes--
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
0-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=dishonor,Hmm...
0-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=chuckle,Now, <i>I</i> don't mind a woman that's so forward.
0-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
0-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
0-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3=denial,Your brasserie is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
0-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
0-female_removed_major=joy,What kind of virile man wouldn’t want to see someone like ~name~ take off her ~clothing~?
0-female_removed_major=interested,Don’t be shy, ~name~! I’m-I’m sure there are worse secrets to keep than that.
0-female_removed_major=interested,~name~ looks fantastic. Especially without her ~clothing~. Uh, don’t worry, ~name~, I can definitely keep you safe from invaders. Both of the horde and personal space types.
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
0-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=challenge,Bring it on, then.
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
0-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
0-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=chuckle,Uh, yeah! Sure was the best disguise here, right, everyone?
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested,I admire your forthrightness, if not your modesty.
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!

#lost bracers
1-male_removing_major=joy,Makes sense, big strong guy like ~name~, making big strong plays like his ~clothing~!
1-male_removing_major=dishonor,If I were in your ~clothing~, I’d have taken off two by now.
1-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
1-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=challenge,Glad to see you aren't a pushover, Jotaro.
1-male_removed_major=yikes,See, have a little courage, like ~name~. Taking off ~clothing~ in a game like this is obviously the right play. You know, for the rest of us, eh?
1-male_removed_major=challenge,Oh, just your ~clothing~? Well when it’s my turn, I’d take-- uh, I’d take off something even bigger.
1-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
1-female_removing_major=surprise,Your ~clothing~ was gorgeous, ~name~... uh, what I mean to say is...
1-female_removing_major=chuckle,Fa Ping is one of the most versatile soldiers you’ll meet! I can compliment ~name~ on her ~clothing~ and enjoy whatever she had beneath it.
1-female_removing_major=challenge,I admire a woman who can keep a brave face, even during something challenging…
1-female_removing_major=interested,It’s wonderful to come from a land that respects honor and strength… regardless of one’s state of birth.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=chuckle,Now, <i>I</i> don't mind a woman that's so forward.
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0=chuckle,Uh... I'm right here, Elizabeth. Not that you should be embarassed I'm a lad-- a lad! A gentleman, though.
1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
1-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
1-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3=denial,Your brasserie is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
1-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
1-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=dishonor,Hmm...
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
1-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=yikes,My eyes--
1-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
1-female_removed_major=joy,What kind of virile man wouldn’t want to see someone like ~name~ take off her ~clothing~?
1-female_removed_major=interested,Don’t be shy, ~name~! I’m-I’m sure there are worse secrets to keep than that.
1-female_removed_major=interested,~name~ looks fantastic. Especially without her ~clothing~. Uh, don’t worry, ~name~, I can definitely keep you safe from invaders. Both of the horde and personal space types.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.

1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.

1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested,I admire your forthrightness, if not your modesty.
1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=chuckle,Uh, yeah! Sure was the best disguise here, right, everyone?
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=smirk,Or so I would assume.
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
1-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=challenge,Bring it on, then.

7-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
7-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=dishonor,Hmm...
7-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
7-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
7-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=yikes,My eyes--
7-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
7-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
7-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
7-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
7-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
7-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
7-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
7-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
7-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2=chuckle,Now, <i>I</i> don't mind a woman that's so forward.
7-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3=denial,Your brasserie is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
7-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
7-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
7-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
7-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
7-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
7-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
7-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
7-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
7-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
7-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
7-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
7-female_removed_major=yikes,You’re showing off more than ever, but you’re still so mysterious, ~name~.
7-female_removed_major=joy,I don’t like matchmakers, but looks like we match, huh, ~name~?
7-female_removed_major=chuckle,They say that even barbarian women often go into battle with little clothing… I don’t see a fight breaking out here, so you should be okay, right, ~name~?
7-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=smirk,Or so I would assume.
7-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smirk,A truly noble soul is never at a loss for words. Your <i>real</i> class is showing, <i>Miss</i> Remilia.
7-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
7-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
7-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=smirk,Reaching for the bottle? The mark of faltering courage, when not offered by friends.
7-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
7-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
7-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
7-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
7-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
7-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
7-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
7-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested,I admire your forthrightness, if not your modesty.
7-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=challenge,Bring it on, then.
7-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
7-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=denial,I thought mine worked better, Princess Jasmine.
7-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
7-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
7-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
7-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
7-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
7-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
7-female_removed_major,target:marinette=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
7-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
7-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
7-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
7-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
7-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.

-3-male_removed_major=joy,I’m glad you’re making this a battle worth fighting, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.

-1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
-1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=dishonor,Hmm...
-1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
-1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=yikes,My eyes--

-1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
-1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
-1-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
-1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
-1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
-1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
-1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
-1-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
-1-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3=denial,Your brasserie is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
-1-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?

-1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
-1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
-1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
-1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
-1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2=denial,I thought mine worked better, Princess Jasmine.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
-1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
-1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
-1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
-1-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
-1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=interested,I admire your forthrightness, if not your modesty.
-1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4=smirk,A truly noble soul is never at a loss for words. Your <i>real</i> class is showing, <i>Miss</i> Remilia.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
-1-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
-1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
-1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
-1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
-1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=smirk,Reaching for the bottle? The mark of faltering courage, when not offered by friends.
-1-female_removed_major,target:marinette=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
-1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
-1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
-1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=challenge,Bring it on, then.
-1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4=smirk,Or so I would assume.

1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan=chuckle,Huh! I haven’t seen underwear like that before. It just shows off everything so <i>well</i>! I might have to invest in a pair of those before I head home.
1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,marker:sph=yikes,Well, it’s certainly bigger than mine… which may not be saying much…
1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=challenge,Heh-heh. If you aren’t going to brag about that, ~name~, I don’t mind doing it for you.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=interested,I’m not blushing. I’m red with jealousy.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,filter:huge_penis=dishonor,Hold on, I know soldiers like to joke about the size of their <i>sword</i>, but that thing would just rearrange someone’s insides… much like a sword.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:7=chuckle,Ai-yah! Here I was, worried you were overcompensating! I suppose you'd be right at home in the <i>Wang</i> dynasty.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Handle yourself with grace, ~name~, no matter what.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible=joy,I have to say, I wasn’t really expecting to see something so exciting so soon in the game. Don’t mind me if I’m a bit speechless…
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=smirk,Of course <i>I</i> agree with you, Crown Prince.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:2=interested,So... vulgar...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:1=chuckle,Normally, I'm all about modesty. In this game, I suppose I should appreciate the unusual view?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=yikes,Though, I suppose that could change! The rules, like me, can be flexible, honestly!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:4=challenge,I'll make my own destiny, thanks. And that means watching you lose!

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:4=denial,It was an act!? I can't believe that fooled me!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria=smirk,Catria, you don't need to be embarrassed by your body. Not when you have a sizable <i>arse</i>enal...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=smirk,I don't think there's any shame in wanting to see your--
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=peace,I have to say, small breasts are underrated. Speaking from <i>intensive</i> experience, if they’re enough to fill your hand, they should be enough to fill your heart.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6=smirk,If you hold your nerve... I bet ~player~ would hold your hand... <i>(Or something else, if you'd prefer?</i>)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5=joy,I'd wager destiny's working out for me.

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3=yikes,If you're trying to seduce me to evil, it won't work! ...Right?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=surprise,I bet your partner’s very pleased with your size, ~name~. I know I certainly would be. Hard to imagine a lady like you wouldn’t have her pick of the boys! Or girls. Girls are fine too, right?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=surprise,Goodness! I was hoping those’d be real, but wow, ~name~, does the Emperor know you’re walking around with that kind of ordinance outside his concubine chambers?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5=challenge,There's clearly more to you than meets the eye. And there was already so much to enjoy!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=denial,I-I’m always curious to see how styles differ. Uh. Between the many women I’ve seen naked. Obviously.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Well, ~name~, I wouldn’t worry too much. Everyone here looks like they’re going to appreciate whatever you’re about to show off. I know I will.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=challenge,But as someone once said, a journey of a thousand miles…

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6=interested,I was actually quite impressed with your underwear! It looks so comfortable... but...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=smirk,I think you'd keep things very, very interesting, as a member of our society.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=surprise,Well, Mushu is always nude. And Elsa has a bad habit about getting naked around Anna, and I don’t always think she’s quite human…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprise,Whoa, hold on, Twilight, there’s no need to be so vulgar so soon--
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=joy,I respect your conviction, Crown Prince. If I weren't loyal to my emperor, I would surely find myself in the host of your elite warriors.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=interested,In truth, the rumors you hear of the other Princesses aren't wholly accurate...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=joy,Oh, come now, Catria. Well, don't <i>come</i> yet...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5=interested,...Go on...?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3=interested,Ah, you must be from a world near the Land of Dragons... I see that women there are... afforded more freedom, perhaps.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5=chuckle,Well, I guess now we'll see your true face!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5=peace,Though, let's see how you look when you're alone and naked.
1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested,O-oh. Very sexy. It’s kind of like my-- <i>many</i> of the ones I’ve seen before. You uh, are in kind of a hurry to get naked though, given I’m still… still in my armor.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria,alsoPlaying:meia,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_bare,marker:blue_hair_bare=peace,Oh, I see. Women with blue hair don't have hair there, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed,priority:0=interested,I would never have thought to do that! If I were a woman. Uh, next time I’m with someone, I’ll ask that she do something similar. To honor you, ~name~.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=surprise,And people complain that <i>men</i> are hairy. Not me, I’m actually very self conscious of my lack of facial hair. Though, if I put my mouth on you… I <i>would</i> look like I had a mustache...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:4=challenge,You seem quite interested in ~Player~. But I might be as worthy of a challenge, eh, Juri?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,priority:0=challenge,Wait a second, are you still-- oh, you’re not wearing underwear. You’re just… do all of your people look like that? My-- uh, women in the Land of Dragons tend to have hair there. How exotic.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=yikes,Looks like <i>someone</i> had something to prove!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ini,targetStage:6=surprise,It... it doesn't match! How'd you do that!?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:6=joy,Impressive! I've used fireworks a few times myself!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sei,alsoPlaying:meia,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_bare,marker:blue_hair_bare=peace,Oh, I see. Women with blue hair don't have hair there, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:7=joy,How could I not look? Your hair is pink, even down there! You are <i>heavenly</i>, Sayori!

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer=denial,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer=surprise,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer=yikes,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,alsoPlaying:sei,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_bare,marker:blue_hair_bare=peace,Oh, I see. Women with blue hair don't have hair there, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria,alsoPlaying:sei,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_bare,marker:blue_hair_bare=peace,Oh, I see. Women with blue hair don't have hair there, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elizabeth=smirk,Though <i>Elizabeth</i> insists she's not a Princess, <i>I</i> insist that this is the first royal... edifice... I've seen.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:zone-tan=yikes,Judging by your... ah, overall appearance, you would certainly be good variety...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger,priority:0=smirk,Oh, I see. Like Ariel's, or Merida's.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=denial,Well, I don't think <i>I'd</i> want to be legendary for this, Crown Prince...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:blonde,priority:0=chuckle,I know a blonde girl who can do crazy stuff with her hair. And that does mean all of it.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:3=chuckle,...but I've never heard of any woman, spirit or human, that wore flowers anywhere but her head.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:6=interested,I've won battles less attired... well, I do have hair... what an odd appearance.

7-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:model,totalNaked:1,notSaidMarker:challenge_answer,marker:duel_model=challenge,So, ~name~, you lost! What exactly do you serve as a model for?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:military,totalNaked:1,notSaidMarker:challenge_answer,marker:duel_military=challenge,So, from one soldier to another, and since you lost: It was always… different, to try and satisfy myself at camp. Any advice for how you slip away?

-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=peace,I may be willing to bend the rules, but, I think good things like ~name~’s chest are worth waiting for.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=peace,You might think that after a year of training with the military, I’d get bored of this… But, I suppose being at your limit brings a new charm to everything.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=chuckle,I enjoy a man with some fight in him!
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m=interested,Oh, I see. You and your wife have a rather interesting relationship, Corrin.

-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=surprise,...For a game that isn’t for children, it seems odd to censor a man’s nipples.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smirk,It’s impressive, in some ways. Refreshing to see such honesty, especially among nobles.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,targetStage:4=surprise,But since your shirt's off, can I see how your wings attach?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=peace,I wonder if you have a weapon that matches your wits, ~name~.

-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=interested,I’ve seen a few that were that big, but… never in a capacity so close.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:7=chuckle,Ai-yah! Here I was, worried you were overcompensating! I suppose you'd be right at home in the <i>Wang</i> dynasty.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,filter:huge_penis=surprise,<i>Aiyah</i>. That’s just terrifying!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=challenge,So much in life is about honor and competition, and this and that…

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,...but one must always take time to appreciate the wondrous things in life, such as ~name~’s lovely breasts.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=interested,It... would allow one to pretend to being male, after all. Uh... yes. One's wife.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria=chuckle,What I mean to say is that your <i>ass</i>ets lie elsewhere.

-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6=smirk,If you hold your nerve... I bet ~player~ would hold your hand... <i>(Or something else, if you'd prefer?</i>)
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,It’s easy to lose sight of the most important things. Like ~name~’s beautiful chest.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,I try to take time for things, big and small, or even the enjoyable, middling tasks, like ~name~’s chest.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,I can’t say I’m in a position to dispute this, though.

-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=chuckle,<i>Hm.</i> You certainly are animated... Even down to, um, the tits.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=surprise,--bra!? What a surprise!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=yikes,I know a woman like ~name~, even with her… wealth! Would certainly rather make a tale of her own than be a trophy.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=surprise,I imagine much of your story fixates on the wrong parts of it, ~name~... I’m sorry about that.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5=challenge,There's clearly more to you than meets the eye. And there was already so much to enjoy!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I’m… familiar enough with uhm. Men’s anatomy. But I’m hardly a princess when it comes to women.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,I’m more than happy to enjoy a woman’s company too, ~name~... what about you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=joy,I respect your conviction, Crown Prince. If I weren't loyal to my emperor, I would surely find myself in the host of your elite warriors.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5=chuckle,Well, I guess now we'll see your true face!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3=interested,Ah, you must be from a world near the Land of Dragons... I see that women there are... afforded more freedom, perhaps.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=interested,Hm. I've heard of some women covering themselves in flowers...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5=peace,Though, let's see how you look when you're alone and naked.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5=interested,...Go on...?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=challenge,But as someone once said, a journey of a thousand miles…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=smirk,I think you'd keep things very, very interesting, as a member of our society.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=joy,Oh, come now, Catria. Well, don't <i>come</i> yet...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=surprise,Well, Mushu is always nude. And Elsa has a bad habit about getting naked around Anna, and I don’t always think she’s quite human…

-3-female_crotch_is_visible=joy,I know you're not a prize to be won, but I'm quite enjoying this, ~name~!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:blonde,priority:0=chuckle,I know a blonde girl who can do crazy stuff with her hair. And that does mean all of it.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,priority:0=smirk,Is that a natural look, ~name~, or…? I certainly hope you're mature enough to be here… it would be humiliating to have been beaten by a child.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,priority:0=joy,I admit, I'd anticipated something different when they said “dark side of the moon.” In this saying, your butt is your moon.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed,priority:0=yikes,So fancy! I'd love to feel that under my fingers. Though, they're pretty callused. So, if you'd be okay with a man, I should be quite similar, ~name~.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger,priority:0=smirk,Oh, I see. Like Ariel's, or Merida's.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:6=joy,Impressive! I've used fireworks a few times myself!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:3=chuckle,...but I've never heard of any woman, spirit or human, that wore flowers anywhere but her head.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:7=joy,How could I not look? Your hair is pink, even down there! You are <i>heavenly</i>, Sayori!

-1-male_chest_is_visible=challenge,...But only after you take off the rest.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m=smirk,It’s impressive, in some ways. Refreshing to see such honesty, especially among nobles.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s=surprise,...For a game that isn’t for children, it seems odd to censor a man’s nipples.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=smirk,Impressive, Jotaro. I'd like to see how you wrestle.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,targetStage:4=surprise,But since your shirt's off, can I see how your wings attach?

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:7=chuckle,Ai-yah! Here I was, worried you were overcompensating! I suppose you'd be right at home in the <i>Wang</i> dynasty.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=joy,You’ve held out very well, ~name~!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:1=chuckle,Normally, I'm all about modesty. In this game, I suppose I should appreciate the unusual view?

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:4=interested,Who is this great spirit you've invoked, Sheena?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:4=denial,It was an act!? I can't believe that fooled me!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:4=challenge,I'll make my own destiny, thanks. And that means watching you lose!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=yikes,Though, I suppose that could change! The rules, like me, can be flexible, honestly!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy=yikes,“Those who set fires against their neighbors…”
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:5=interested,There's no need to fear now, Sayori! Hold your nerve!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko=smirk,Of course <i>I</i> agree with you, Crown Prince.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=yikes,In war, deception can win many battles… but this seems a bit like overt disregard of the rules…
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=smirk,I don't think there's any shame in wanting to see your--
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria=smirk,Catria, you don't need to be embarrassed by your body. Not when you have a sizable <i>arse</i>enal...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,Don’t be so shy, ~name~. You have the right build to be a great wrestler. Want me to prove it?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria=chuckle,What I mean to say is that your <i>ass</i>ets lie elsewhere.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=dishonor,(<i>Why do I always get the spirits that are a little... unusual...</i>)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6=smirk,If you hold your nerve... I bet ~player~ would hold your hand... <i>(Or something else, if you'd prefer?</i>)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte,targetStage:6=interested,Oh, my apologies, Lotte. They're just quite pink! Bigger than mine, if that's consolation...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia=smirk,I guess a <i>commoner</i> like me was destined to see your chest, Remilia.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko=interested,It... would allow one to pretend to being male, after all. Uh... yes. One's wife.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested,Not too small, not too big… I should give them a feel. Just to make sure they’re as perfect as they seem to be.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy=dishonor,"Quickly find their own fields aflame.”
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4=surprise,--bra!? What a surprise!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=interested,I can’t say I’m in a position to dispute this, though.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth=chuckle,You have beautiful breasts, Elizabeth! I suppose they'd look even better in candlelight... alone... with just us...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan=chuckle,<i>Hm.</i> You certainly are animated... Even down to, um, the tits.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5=yikes,I... suppose her disguise worked, though...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3=yikes,If you're trying to seduce me to evil, it won't work! ...Right?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=challenge,I guess the big stuff does tend to come last…
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5=challenge,There's clearly more to you than meets the eye. And there was already so much to enjoy!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested,Like all gifts, I think unwrapping you last is worth the wait.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3=interested,Ah, you must be from a world near the Land of Dragons... I see that women there are... afforded more freedom, perhaps.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0=surprise,Whoa, hold on, Twilight, there’s no need to be so vulgar so soon--
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5=peace,Though, let's see how you look when you're alone and naked.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5=chuckle,Well, I guess now we'll see your true face!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6=interested,I was actually quite impressed with your underwear! It looks so comfortable... but...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2=interested,Hm. I've heard of some women covering themselves in flowers...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria=joy,Oh, come now, Catria. Well, don't <i>come</i> yet...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko=joy,I respect your conviction, Crown Prince. If I weren't loyal to my emperor, I would surely find myself in the host of your elite warriors.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=surprise,Well, Mushu is always nude. And Elsa has a bad habit about getting naked around Anna, and I don’t always think she’s quite human…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella=challenge,But as someone once said, a journey of a thousand miles…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan=smirk,I think you'd keep things very, very interesting, as a member of our society.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5=interested,...Go on...?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=interested,In truth, the rumors you hear of the other Princesses aren't wholly accurate...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=challenge,And after I’m already finished. For shame, ~name~! Did you think this was a sleepover?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:blonde,priority:0=chuckle,I know a blonde girl who can do crazy stuff with her hair. And that does mean all of it.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:miko=denial,Well, I don't think <i>I'd</i> want to be legendary for this, Crown Prince...

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

female_masturbating=interested,Is this how you say goodbye to those you’ve known, ~name~? Thinking of a romance shared under some falling petals? Um, don’t mind me. Just… thinking.
female_finished_masturbating=peace,They say a measure of elegance is timeliness. Thanks for not taking <i>terribly</i> too long.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:futaba,saidMarker:duel_lost,notSaidMarker:duel_futaba_lost,marker:duel_futaba_lost=denial,Well, no, Futaba. I did it... well, for a lot of reasons. That may have been a small one. Very small. Quite small.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:kizuna,saidMarker:duel_lost,notSaidMarker:duel_ai_lost,marker:duel_ai_lost=chuckle,No, it's pretty easy to fill in generic cases, and obviously I can react directly to targeted lines. I do think trap support is a ways off, but for now you can be clever, right, Ms. Ai?

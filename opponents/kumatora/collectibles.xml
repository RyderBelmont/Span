        <text>You found this slightly-crappy, ultra-mysterious looking doorknob after your game with Kumatora. You can't help but feel a well-traveled, wise aura radiating off of it. What adventures has this doorknob been on? What sights has it seen?  It doesn't seem eager to tell you...</text>
        <unlock>Play a game with Kumatora. You don't have to win, just as long as she loses.</unlock>

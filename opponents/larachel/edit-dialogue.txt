#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
0-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
0-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
0-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
0-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
0-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
0-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
0-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
0-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
0-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
0-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
0-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
0-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
0-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
0-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
0-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
0-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
0-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
0-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
0-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
0-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
0-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
0-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
0-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
0-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
0-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
0-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
0-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
0-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
0-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
0-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
0-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
0-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
0-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
0-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
0-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
0-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
0-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
0-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
0-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
0-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
0-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
0-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
0-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
0-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
0-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
0-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
0-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
0-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
0-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
0-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
0-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
0-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
0-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
0-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
0-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
0-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
0-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
0-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
0-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
0-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
0-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
0-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
0-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
0-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
0-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
0-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
0-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
0-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
0-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
0-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
0-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,I've taken Princess Amalia's skirt already? This is going much better than planned.
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
0-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
0-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
0-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
0-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
0-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
0-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
0-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
0-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
0-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
0-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
0-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
0-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
0-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
0-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
0-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
0-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
0-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
0-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
0-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
0-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
0-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
0-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
0-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
0-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
0-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
0-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
0-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
0-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
0-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
0-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
0-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
0-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
0-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
0-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
0-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
0-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
0-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
0-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
0-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
0-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
0-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
0-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
0-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
0-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
0-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
0-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
0-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
0-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
0-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
0-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
0-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
0-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
0-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
0-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
0-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
0-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
0-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
0-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
0-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
0-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:4,count-french:2-3,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, I think you and I are in the minority here. At least they're understandable for the most part...
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
0-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
0-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
0-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,You needn't trouble yourself with carrying things on your person. Is that not what convoys are for?
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Regardless, I shall not drag this out. The game shall continue now.
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Very well. Deal us.
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,At least speak in a language we can understand!
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? You know magic?
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,And why are you only getting rid of <i>some</i>?
0-opponent_stripped,target:amalia,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Ah! Yes. You're still nude. My apologies. Let's carry on.
0-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
0-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
0-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
0-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
0-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
0-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
0-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
0-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
0-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
0-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
0-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
0-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
0-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
0-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
0-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
0-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
0-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,Your fate has been worse than my own so far. I'm thankful for what I still have...
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
0-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
0-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
0-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
0-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
0-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
0-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
0-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
0-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,All the great heroes do. Are you perhaps one yourself?
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
0-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
0-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
0-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
0-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,In my many travels, I've seen more than my share of adornments, but never one like that.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
0-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
0-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
0-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Attendants are wonderful- er, so I hope! Indeed!
0-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
0-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
0-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
0-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
0-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
0-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
0-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
0-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
0-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
0-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
0-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
0-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
0-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
0-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
0-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
0-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
0-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
0-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
0-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
0-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
0-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
0-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
0-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
0-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
0-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
0-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
0-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
0-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=embarrassed,To think, you'd humor these perverse rules...
0-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
0-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
0-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
0-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
0-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
0-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=embarrassed,This is behavior I'd expect from a demon, not... you.
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!

1-opponent_lost,filter:drunk,notSaidMarker:drunk,marker:drunk,direction:down=smug,You know, you could have won that hand if you were in a better state of mind. Some... helpful advice.

1-opponent_lost,filter:gun,notSaidMarker:gun,marker:gun,direction:down=confused,Tell me, what kind of tool is that? It looks like the Summoner's Breidablik, yet much less pleasing to the eyes... and ears.
1-opponent_lost,filter:hero,notSaidMarker:hero,marker:hero,direction:down=happy,I can sense that you have a kind heart, much like myself. Perhaps you and I can be allies?
1-opponent_lost,filter:horned,notSaidMarker:horns,marker:horns,direction:down=shocked,Even if you appear mostly human, I will not be deceived! Those horns are a tell that you're a monster!

1-opponent_lost,filter:magic,notSaidMarker:magic,marker:magic,direction:down=smug,Oh? I'm detecting a magical aura from you. Are you trained in the arts? Perhaps we can square off later.

1-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
1-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
1-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
1-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
1-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
1-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
1-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
1-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
1-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
1-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
1-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
1-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
1-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
1-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
1-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
1-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=mad,Hold still. I shall whack this intrusive bug with my staff!
1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
1-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
1-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
1-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
1-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
1-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
1-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
1-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
1-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
1-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
1-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
1-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
1-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
1-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
1-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
1-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
1-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,I've taken Princess Amalia's skirt already? This is going much better than planned.
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
1-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
1-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
1-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
1-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
1-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
1-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
1-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
1-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
1-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
1-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
1-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
1-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
1-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
1-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
1-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
1-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
1-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
1-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
1-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
1-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
1-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
1-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
1-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
1-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
1-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,Your fate has been worse than my own so far. I'm thankful for what I still have...
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,All the great heroes do. Are you perhaps one yourself?
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
1-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
1-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,In my many travels, I've seen more than my share of adornments, but never one like that.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
1-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Attendants are wonderful- er, so I hope! Indeed!
1-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
1-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
1-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
1-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
1-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
1-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
1-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
1-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=embarrassed,To think, you'd humor these perverse rules...
1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
1-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=embarrassed,This is behavior I'd expect from a demon, not... you.
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#lost staff
2-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
2-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
2-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
2-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
2-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
2-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
2-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
2-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
2-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
2-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
2-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
2-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
2-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
2-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
2-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
2-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
2-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
2-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
2-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
2-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
2-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
2-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
2-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
2-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
2-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
2-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
2-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
2-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
2-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
2-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
2-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,I've taken Princess Amalia's skirt already? This is going much better than planned.
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
2-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
2-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
2-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
2-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
2-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
2-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
2-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
2-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
2-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
2-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
2-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
2-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
2-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
2-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
2-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
2-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
2-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
2-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
2-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
2-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
2-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
2-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
2-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
2-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
2-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,Your fate has been worse than my own so far. I'm thankful for what I still have...
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,All the great heroes do. Are you perhaps one yourself?
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
2-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
2-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,In my many travels, I've seen more than my share of adornments, but never one like that.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
2-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
2-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
2-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
2-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
2-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
2-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
2-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
2-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
2-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=embarrassed,To think, you'd humor these perverse rules...
2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
2-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=embarrassed,This is behavior I'd expect from a demon, not... you.
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#lost boots
3-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
3-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
3-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
3-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
3-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
3-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
3-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
3-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
3-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
3-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
3-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
3-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
3-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
3-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
3-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
3-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
3-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
3-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
3-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
3-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
3-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
3-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
3-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
3-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
3-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
3-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
3-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
3-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
3-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
3-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
3-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
3-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,I've taken Princess Amalia's skirt already? This is going much better than planned.
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
3-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
3-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
3-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
3-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
3-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
3-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
3-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
3-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
3-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
3-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
3-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
3-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
3-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
3-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
3-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
3-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
3-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
3-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
3-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
3-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
3-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
3-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
3-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
3-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
3-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,Your fate has been worse than my own so far. I'm thankful for what I still have...
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
3-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
3-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I used to carry around jewelry myself, but I stopped after I started mishandling it. Rennac started working for me around then... strange he never caught the thief.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
3-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
3-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
3-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
3-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
3-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
3-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
3-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
3-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
3-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=embarrassed,To think, you'd humor these perverse rules...
3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
3-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=embarrassed,This is behavior I'd expect from a demon, not... you.
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#lost gloves
4-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
4-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
4-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
4-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
4-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
4-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
4-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
4-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
4-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
4-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
4-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
4-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
4-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
4-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
4-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
4-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
4-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
4-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
4-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
4-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
4-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
4-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
4-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
4-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
4-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
4-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
4-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
4-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
4-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
4-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
4-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
4-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
4-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
4-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
4-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
4-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
4-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
4-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
4-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
4-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
4-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
4-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
4-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
4-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
4-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
4-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
4-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
4-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
4-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
4-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
4-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
4-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
4-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
4-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
4-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
4-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
4-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
4-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
4-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
4-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
4-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
4-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
4-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
4-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
4-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
4-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
4-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
4-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
4-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
4-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
4-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
4-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
4-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
4-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
4-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
4-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
4-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
4-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
4-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
4-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
4-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
4-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
4-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
4-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
4-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
4-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
4-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
4-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
4-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
4-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
4-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
4-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
4-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
4-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
4-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
4-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
4-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
4-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
4-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
4-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
4-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
4-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
4-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
4-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
4-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
4-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
4-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,I've taken Princess Amalia's skirt already? This is going much better than planned.
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
4-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
4-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
4-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
4-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
4-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
4-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
4-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
4-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
4-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
4-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
4-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
4-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
4-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
4-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
4-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
4-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
4-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
4-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
4-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
4-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
4-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
4-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
4-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
4-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
4-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
4-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
4-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
4-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
4-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
4-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
4-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
4-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
4-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
4-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
4-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
4-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
4-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
4-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
4-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
4-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
4-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
4-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
4-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
4-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
4-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
4-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
4-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
4-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
4-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
4-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
4-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
4-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
4-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
4-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
4-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
4-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
4-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
4-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
4-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
4-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
4-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
4-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
4-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
4-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
4-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
4-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
4-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
4-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
4-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
4-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
4-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
4-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
4-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
4-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
4-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
4-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
4-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
4-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
4-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
4-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
4-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
4-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
4-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
4-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
4-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
4-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
4-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
4-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
4-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
4-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
4-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
4-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
4-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
4-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
4-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
4-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
4-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
4-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
4-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
4-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
4-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
4-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
4-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
4-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
4-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
4-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
4-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,Your fate has been worse than my own so far. I'm thankful for what I still have...
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
4-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
4-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
4-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
4-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
4-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
4-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
4-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
4-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
4-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
4-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
4-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
4-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I used to carry around jewelry myself, but I stopped after I started mishandling it. Rennac started working for me around then... strange he never caught the thief.
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
4-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
4-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
4-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
4-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
4-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
4-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
4-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
4-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
4-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
4-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
4-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
4-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
4-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
4-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
4-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
4-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
4-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
4-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
4-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
4-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
4-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
4-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
4-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
4-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
4-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
4-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
4-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
4-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
4-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
4-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
4-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
4-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
4-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
4-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
4-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
4-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
4-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
4-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
4-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
4-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
4-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
4-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
4-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=embarrassed,To think, you'd humor these perverse rules...
4-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
4-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
4-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
4-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
4-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
4-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=embarrassed,This is behavior I'd expect from a demon, not... you.
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#lost robe
5-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
5-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
5-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
5-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
5-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
5-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
5-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
5-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
5-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
5-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
5-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
5-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
5-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
5-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
5-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
5-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
5-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
5-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
5-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
5-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
5-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
5-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
5-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
5-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
5-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
5-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
5-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
5-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
5-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
5-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
5-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
5-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
5-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
5-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
5-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
5-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
5-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
5-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
5-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
5-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
5-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
5-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
5-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
5-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
5-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
5-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
5-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
5-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
5-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
5-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
5-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
5-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
5-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
5-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
5-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
5-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
5-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
5-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
5-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
5-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
5-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
5-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
5-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
5-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
5-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
5-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
5-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
5-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
5-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
5-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
5-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
5-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
5-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
5-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
5-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
5-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
5-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
5-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
5-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
5-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
5-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
5-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
5-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
5-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
5-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
5-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
5-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
5-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
5-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
5-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
5-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
5-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
5-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
5-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
5-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
5-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
5-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
5-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
5-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
5-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
5-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
5-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
5-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
5-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
5-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
5-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
5-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
5-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,It's about time! Do you not see my current state?
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
5-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
5-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
5-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
5-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
5-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
5-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
5-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
5-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
5-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
5-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
5-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
5-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
5-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
5-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
5-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
5-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
5-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
5-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
5-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
5-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
5-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
5-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
5-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
5-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
5-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
5-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
5-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
5-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
5-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
5-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
5-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
5-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
5-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
5-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
5-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
5-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
5-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
5-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
5-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
5-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
5-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
5-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
5-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
5-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
5-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
5-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
5-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
5-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
5-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
5-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
5-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
5-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
5-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
5-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
5-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
5-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
5-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
5-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
5-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
5-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
5-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
5-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
5-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
5-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
5-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
5-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
5-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
5-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
5-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
5-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
5-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
5-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
5-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
5-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
5-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
5-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
5-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
5-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
5-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
5-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
5-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
5-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
5-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
5-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
5-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
5-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
5-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
5-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
5-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
5-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
5-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
5-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
5-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
5-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
5-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
5-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
5-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
5-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
5-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
5-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
5-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
5-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
5-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
5-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
5-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
5-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
5-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,Your fate has been worse than my own so far. I'm thankful for what I still have...
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
5-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
5-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
5-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
5-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
5-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
5-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
5-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
5-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
5-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
5-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
5-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
5-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I used to carry around jewelry myself, but I stopped after I started mishandling it. Rennac started working for me around then... strange he never caught the thief.
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
5-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
5-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
5-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
5-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
5-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
5-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
5-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
5-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
5-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
5-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
5-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
5-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
5-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
5-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
5-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
5-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
5-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
5-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
5-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
5-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
5-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
5-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
5-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
5-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
5-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
5-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
5-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
5-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
5-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
5-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
5-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
5-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
5-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
5-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
5-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
5-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
5-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
5-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
5-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
5-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
5-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
5-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
5-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,D-Don't you dare look at me! Not even angels can be an exception.
5-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
5-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
5-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
5-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
5-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
5-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=embarrassed,This is behavior I'd expect from a demon, not... you.
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#naked
-3-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
-3-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
-3-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
-3-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
-3-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
-3-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
-3-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
-3-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
-3-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
-3-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
-3-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
-3-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
-3-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
-3-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
-3-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
-3-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
-3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
-3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
-3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
-3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
-3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
-3-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
-3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
-3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
-3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
-3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
-3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
-3-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
-3-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
-3-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
-3-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
-3-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
-3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
-3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
-3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
-3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
-3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
-3-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
-3-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
-3-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
-3-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Well, smiting monsters is my forte, but I do get a kick out of besting a mook like you from time to time.
-3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
-3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
-3-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
-3-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
-3-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
-3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
-3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
-3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
-3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
-3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
-3-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
-3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
-3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
-3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
-3-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
-3-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
-3-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
-3-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
-3-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
-3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
-3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
-3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
-3-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
-3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
-3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
-3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
-3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
-3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
-3-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
-3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
-3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
-3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
-3-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
-3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
-3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
-3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
-3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
-3-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
-3-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
-3-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
-3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
-3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
-3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
-3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
-3-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
-3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
-3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
-3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
-3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
-3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
-3-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
-3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
-3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
-3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
-3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
-3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
-3-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,It's about time! Do you not see my current state?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
-3-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=mad,I hope you're happy. Now <i>two</i> undercover princesses have been stripped bare from this game.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I used to carry around jewelry myself, but I stopped after I started mishandling it. Rennac started working for me around then... strange he never caught the thief.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
-3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,D-Don't you dare look at me! Not even angels can be an exception.
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
-3-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=horny,You just... while I'm like this...
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#masturbating
-2-opponent_lost,notSaidMarker:forfeit_sit,priority:600,direction:down=s_ashamed,I'm not... <i>pleased</i> by any such turns of events. A h-holy woman is better than that.
-2-opponent_lost,notSaidMarker:forfeit_sit,priority:600,direction:down=s_horny,O-oh! What... Why should I be...?
-2-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
-2-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
-2-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
-2-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
-2-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
-2-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
-2-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
-2-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
-2-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
-2-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
-2-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
-2-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
-2-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
-2-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
-2-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
-2-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
-2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
-2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
-2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
-2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
-2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
-2-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
-2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
-2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
-2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
-2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
-2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
-2-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
-2-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
-2-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
-2-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
-2-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
-2-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
-2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
-2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
-2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
-2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
-2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
-2-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
-2-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
-2-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
-2-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,How could I let you outlast me? Was my guard down...?
-2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
-2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
-2-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
-2-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
-2-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
-2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
-2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
-2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
-2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
-2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
-2-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
-2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
-2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
-2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
-2-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
-2-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
-2-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
-2-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
-2-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
-2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
-2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
-2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
-2-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
-2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
-2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
-2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
-2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
-2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
-2-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
-2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
-2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
-2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
-2-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
-2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
-2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
-2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
-2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
-2-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
-2-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
-2-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
-2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
-2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
-2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
-2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
-2-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
-2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
-2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
-2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
-2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
-2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
-2-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
-2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
-2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
-2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
-2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
-2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
-2-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,It's about time! Do you not see my current state?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
-2-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=mad,I hope you're happy. Now <i>two</i> undercover princesses have been stripped bare from this game.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I used to carry around jewelry myself, but I stopped after I started mishandling it. Rennac started working for me around then... strange he never caught the thief.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
-2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
-2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,D-Don't you dare look at me! Not even angels can be an exception.
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
-2-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=horny,You just... while I'm like this...
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!


#finished
-1-opponent_lost,target:9s,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Remove that blindfold at once! How can you bear witness to me if you cannot see?
-1-opponent_lost,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,Do not think that I will underestimate you just because you are a woman! There can be no mistaking that you are a brigand!
-1-opponent_lost,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh? And just what do you plan to do with that... <i>thing</i>?
-1-opponent_lost,target:angie,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Oh! By chance, are you one of the fabled manakete of old? No, that would not make sense with such strange garb...
-1-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,My word, is that a rapier strapped to your arm? Or are you like those pirates who replace their hands with a hook?
-1-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I would recommend not invoking her wrath, ~player~. That instrument on her right arm is most likely lethal.
-1-opponent_lost,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,To think you had a chance against a <i>true</i> healer was your utmost folly.
-1-opponent_lost,target:bi,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,~player~, did you really pick Bi of all characters? I question your ability to make rational tactical decisions.
-1-opponent_lost,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I-If I may ask, why have you decided to forgo wearing pants? Could that be a valuable battle tactic?
-1-opponent_lost,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Do tell me, what is a pegasus knight such as yourself doing in a location like this?
-1-opponent_lost,target:coco,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,You there, suspicious girl! Remove that eyewear at once!
-1-opponent_lost,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,I can sense a draconic presence coming from you... but you don't seem like a manakete.
-1-opponent_lost,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You're a manakete, I'm certain. So why do you shy away from us?
-1-opponent_lost,target:croix,targetStage:0,direction:down=sad,These floating cubes shapes are yours correct? Call them back at once! They're rather... intrusive.
-1-opponent_lost,target:elaine,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,Ah, a veritable pirate, at long last! Truly, fortune smiles on me to grant me an opportunity to show my skills thusly!
-1-opponent_lost,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Wait, I thought I read that you were a <i>nun</i>! But no woman of the cloth would dress so... so... immodestly!
-1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,I have been meaning to ask you a question or two...
-1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:fled,direction:down=interested,Who's watching?
-1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. You may proceed, young Florina.
-1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Your bumbling demeanor reminds me of a particular companion I had at one point.
-1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,You have nothing to fear.
-1-opponent_lost,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,direction:down=awkward,Someone, fetch my staff! Not to cheat, but to fend off this attacking insect!
-1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You choose to hide your face, spider... person.
-1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Will you continue this charade? Or will you show me your true form?
-1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,I do enjoy gazing upon your face, actually.
-1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,To think you would joke around in a situation like this...
-1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,How careless you were.
-1-opponent_lost,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,So, about before...
-1-opponent_lost,target:hanako,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Hmm... I just now noticed, but your face appears horrendously scarred! Never fear, though! I am well equipped to heal wounds such as these.
-1-opponent_lost,target:human,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,~player~? Impossible! Your tactical prowess surpasses even my own!
-1-opponent_lost,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Oho! A fellow anonymous traveller, I see! Well met!
-1-opponent_lost,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You lecherous, lecherous man... don't act so happy about this.
-1-opponent_lost,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,This was only natural. You seem none too pleased, however.
-1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Excellent! A decisive hit on L'Arachel's path to complete victory! Now, surrender that weapon!
-1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I've been thinking. You knew how to use that rapier...
-1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Regardless of your status, you seem to dress like the common street dancer...
-1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,That looks like a pain to put on...
-1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,You are a skilled opponent, but the light of Rausten always prevails in the end.
-1-opponent_lost,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Victory is within sight!
-1-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,C-Can we not get a recount? I'm frightened to see what a man such as this would remove...
-1-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh, I think I understand now...
-1-opponent_lost,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,How could I let you outlast me? Was my guard down...?
-1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Go on, "Marth." Show me what you can do.
-1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Lucina, if I may...
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,You seem to be going for the masked vigilante look as well...
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Now then. I had a question I wished to ask of you, "Ladybug"...
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I was going to ask you before what it's like to be a dashing, extravagent warrior of justice...
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I lost interest in you quite a few rounds ago. I suggest making this quick so as to not waste our time.
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,Marinette, yes? Tell me, how can I, L'Arachel, be a boon to you?
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Feel free to ask for the warrior of light's protection anytime.
-1-opponent_lost,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,And now you are down to the wire...
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,My, is she eager! Settle down!
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Th-Think this through, friend! There are better strategies!
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Tell me, how did you come to be like this?
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Not even the Grado imperial family ever got this bad...
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Moon, yes? Can you hear me?
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Were we... too late?
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,Ha ha ha...
-1-opponent_lost,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,Say, why don't you come with us instead of doing... that?
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not be deceived, ~player~. In all likelihood, this is exactly what she wants.
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,By the way she says that, I would fear the worst. Brace for anything!
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Perhaps it would have been easier to smite you from the start...
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Do not even <i>think</i> of humoring her!
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,The time has come, then. Unless there's another bat within your undergarments...
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,For the record, you're not off the hook.
-1-opponent_lost,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,A-Another one appeared!
-1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Good sir, I fear I know not what you mean.
-1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Enough. If you <i>are</i> a man, stop giving us guff and proceed,
-1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Being cautious is the smart maneuver.
-1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I am curious about one front...
-1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Odd. You fight with honor, if not pride...
-1-opponent_lost,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Ah, I would prefer you undressed piecemeal...
-1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,What a tiny thing you are. Run along, this is no place for children.
-1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I understand your hesitation. After all, I believe you should not even be here.
-1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Oh! I know this one!
-1-opponent_lost,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=confident,You are dismissed now.
-1-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,It's you, is it not? When looking at you, I feel a peculiar warmth...
-1-opponent_lost,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,Will you really debase yourself by doing this silly forfeit?
-1-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,Are you perhaps... an angel? Not even you are not immune to the effects of this game...
-1-opponent_lost,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,And just what do you intend to do now that you've lost?
-1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your friend there... is she playing as well?
-1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Now that I get a good look at you, that outfit is... interesting. It's like that of a dancer of Jehanna.
-1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Will you truly keep your mask above all else?
-1-opponent_lost,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,I would say I'm surprised, but I respect you just enough to not lie to your face.
-1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah. Sakuya. Such a reliable-sounding name.
-1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Remilia. A question, if you would.
-1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Nobility or not, I shall make you talk.
-1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Victory is within grasp!
-1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,Of course. I, L'Arachel, am the most virtuous woman alive.
-1-opponent_lost,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Wait, I'm not finished with you yet!
-1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Well now, well now...
-1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I can appreciate the brutality of pure strength.
-1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,So, Rinkah. How would you like to accompany my righteous party?
-1-opponent_lost,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,You don't appear to be faring well, you know.
-1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,If anyone should be treated with scorn here, it's the one with such a cruel-looking blade.
-1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,direction:down=shocked,A deus ex machina? ...Who are you?
-1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,A simple victory over a ruffian like you.
-1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Senketsu? Is there more of you?
-1-opponent_lost,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Despite that show, you're still simple to take down!
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,A singer, are we? This should be refreshing.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Would it be too much to request a simple song?
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,You appear hesitant again. Have you no pride in your profession?
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,I refuse to forgive you so easily.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=dismissive,You know you actively came here and tried to fool all these poor innocent bystanders, right?
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,Still playing innocent? You're just <i>asking</i> for it, aren't you?
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,At least there's <i>some</i> level of progress here.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Ah, vindication by fate. There is truly nothing more rewarding.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,It would seem you, too, have a noble purpose. Perhaps we can be allies.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Can you even prove you are a heroine? Perhaps you merely heard tales of my exploits and are now duplicating them.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You keep speaking of a witch, but for all we know, you could be the one in question.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Just try and teleport, witchling! You'll fall right into the hands of Dozla and Rennac!
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,O divine protectors, please let this witch be wearing <i>some</i> form of undergarment.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,It was inevitable with you, witchy woman.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I hope you do not plan on tearing that jewel from your navel. Such gruesome imagery is... unneeded here.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Y-You <i>are</i> pulling it out? Is this purely an act of spite?
-1-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Oh, I actually got a look at your card for a second.
-1-opponent_lost,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Summoning... could you be a mystical Summoner?
-1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=calm,Predictable little thing, aren't you?
-1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Thought I would let up because you're unarmed? Not in this game!
-1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,I would expect no less from myself nor ~player~.
-1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Your confidence is as translucent as your skin. Let's end this, shall we?
-1-opponent_lost,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,Fear not. I shall grant you some reprisal and allow you to complete your forfeit in peace.
-1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I must say, "Twilight" fits your complexion rather well. Perhaps one day I shall have a similar title...
-1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,If I could make a suggestion, boots are relatively harmless in a game like this.
-1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Surely, you must have grasped what to pick next by this point!
-1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,I know you'll pick your blouse next. Just make it quick.
-1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,So, you'll pick your blouse for sure this time, riiiiight?
-1-opponent_lost,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So now you'll- wait. There's just one thing left.
-1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Well, you look to be no more than a common rogue. I shall make short work of you.
-1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,I understand I was mistaken about your role... you are clearly some sort of mage.
-1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh, do tell... why do you dress so immodestly?
-1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Oh, one thing I've been wondering for a while: is that hair natural?
-1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,I've heard you refer to yourself as a goddess a few times...
-1-opponent_lost,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I can see now why you would wear such an out of place belt.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Eep! So loud!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,There it is again...!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Could you not at least control it better! I would not like to endure whatever weird spell you're casting.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,...I wonder where it went. I thought this place had a roof.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely it cannot get any worse by this point...!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, yes. Excuse me, miss. Would you mind telling that witch girl to come back here as soon as possible?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Oh! I think I understand. Atsuko here must be switching with a doppelganger! Yes, truly!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Oh? What's this satchel? You <i>are</i> a princess, are you not?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,It's about time! Do you not see my current state?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? What if someone is watching you from the shadows?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Are you humming to cope with the embarrassment? Admittedly, that's not a bad idea...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You didn't need to turn around for this...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Well, that seems like a waste. Flowers that size are rare in Rausten, you know.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, the meddlesome plants have been vanquished!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,The way you talk makes me think you're a cleric, but...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Wh-What of accessories? Surely there are a few you can part with before resorting to this!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Although the fact you've made it so far with only one useable arm says wonders...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Just... what are you doing behind that curtain...?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,You're doing it again?!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,You ride a pegasus, just like the knights of Frelia.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=shocked,People can just leave? That will not do! How will I be able to complete my mission?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,It's a mere breastplate. One of the most simple pieces of armor!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Her name was Neimi. Could barely look her companions in the eye without bursting into tears.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,After all, I am here. Look to me as if I were a guiding light in these dark times!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:bee2,direction:down=shocked,Easy, friend! You will destroy your tunic if you keep panicking!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Just take a deep breath and do it.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:florina,targetStage:6,targetSayingMarker:bee3,direction:down=mad,How many times must this happen? Take that!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,I find that odd. You are a warrior of justice as well, are you not?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,Oh, wonderful! At last, the one beneath the mask!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,I find it much more appealing to bet things like secrets than, er, clothing.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Oh! Just pull it down to your knees this time! That would suffice, yes?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Err! I-I apologize, so could you pull that back down?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=confused,Perhaps I misjudged you <i>and</i> your schtick.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jolyne,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,Do not assume that just because we have similar hair colors that I will respect you.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:0,direction:down=boisterous,There will be no stabbing on my watch.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Yet only Princess Eirika can use them. Could you be... a princess?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,And you compose yourself like one as well.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Nothing like my lovely combat dress. Easy to put on in the morning <i>and</i> comfortable to boot.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Impossible! You've mastered <i>gravity</i>?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Although that does leave us with the awkward reality of your nudity...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=mad,How utterly crude! Do you have <i>no</i> common decency?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You must be so loud to mask your lack of intellect.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,Y-You fiend! Just <i>where</i> are you reaching?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,You fiend! How <i>dare</i> you give a lady deja vu!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Maybe there's a brain behind that ear-shattering voice after all.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,The fact you're so calm about this is just... bizarre!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,More nonsense...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:kyoko,targetStage:5-0,direction:down=sad,What a horrible situation...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lara,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,A name thief, eh? To think, I would be so famous as to have a copycat... how wondrous.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're unmasking yourself right away? What about your debonair aura? Your mysterious backstory?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,What conditions were so dire as to make you don a mask and new identity?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,The way you march forward in spite of the losses...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,Truly a cornerstone of a warrior, no?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Even the tunic falls-!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,But some advice: all that red is <i>very</i> hard on the eyes.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,What? She's been bathed in some sort of light...!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,But it seems you are quite ordinary in your normal appearance.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although maybe this gives me a new type of opportunity...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Ah. Yes. The game proceeded whilst I was lost in thought.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Perhaps I was too harsh on you. You are young and inexperienced.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,This shall remain comfortably between you and I.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=shocked,You claim <i>I</i> am evil? Surely you jest! On the contrary, I am the bane of evil!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But nothing happened, did it?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Is she really so infamous...?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,She's not listening to a word I say.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,~Player~, do you think she lost her soul to the Demon King as well?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,You are not in the right state of mind... but do not give in!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Playing along was a mistake... we gave her exactly what she wanted.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=calm,If you think I have given up on her, ~player~, you are sadly mistaken.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Laugh it up while you can, foul demon.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,Unholy bats! Be wary, for they may be rabid, or worse!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,But I am a gracious woman. I shall allow you to thrive in your natural state before I finish you off personally.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Or perhaps I should step in at this point.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To think, I would pity the bats in the end.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,I-It would just be messy to banish you here in front of so many civilians...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,That seems rather... odd. Is this what they call a "fetish"?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ploy? ...You will explain yourself.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,However, I only permit you to hold it if you mean us no harm.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You must have disguised yourself for a reason, yes?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,To one such as me, it's a foreign concept.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Why do I feel as if I am the more embarrassed one in this scenario?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Perhaps this is a bad time to ask, but might I borrow those?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,Oh dear... you're too stubborn for your own good.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:0,direction:down=awkward,She's trying to show off...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Do... you know ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,It's a waistcoat, is it not?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Your shirt's that long?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Just as I said. You're much too young to be playing this game.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So the little girl rambles when cornered...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,Sticking it out to the end, I see. How admirable.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,What's this? A light?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You appear to dress rather sparsely, Navi.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,...If I may be blunt for a moment, your bottoms are so small that I doubt this will make much of a difference.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,But why would you ever play a game like this?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Actually, I just realized...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Such a lovely pendant...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Are those symbols on your belt representative of some divine power?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Forgive my rudeness, but what is the point to only one stocking?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Things have escalated <i>very</i> quickly!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh! Do the gods even have genitalia? I didn't think they were neccessary.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,When I was a kid, I used to hear stories about angels and cherubs all the time.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Losing your nerve already, I see.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Surrender your sandals to me!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Had enough?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Th-This type of behavior is not becoming of an angel at all. I implore you think about this...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,direction:down=happy,Ah, I understand! She must be an attendant.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,A-And apparently you're as shameless as one, too!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,I had a hunch it would turn out this way.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,That was... swift.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Disappearances of clothing aside... might I ask why you appear winged?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Do not underestimate the extravagence of L'Arachel! My splendor always triumphs in the end!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,If only I knew the secret of this Sakuya...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Er, hello?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Gh-! Who's throwing daggers all of a sudden?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smug,Hard to imagine you'd even know what gloves are.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed! Despite my appearance, I'm well acquainted with the strong.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It's a thankless job, but justice is its own reward. Wouldn't you say?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,Let's not drag this out anymore, shall we? Give in and I'll go easy on you.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,How savage.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,Calm down, L'Arachel... these will hardly make a difference.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,direction:down=dismissive,~Player~, why are you not this handy? Perhaps Dozla would have been a better companion tonight.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Were we supposed to undress in tandem all along?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods, she's being eaten alive!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Good. You're disarmed. That makes it a fair duel!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,...Is it hopping away?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:ryuko,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,What? Is she on your side or not?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You seem to hold yourself in high regard. Very atypical for a performer.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Eh? Pardon me, but I see something a bit strange there.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,A-A disguise?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,O-Oh! Never mind! It seems the problem solved itself.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Despicable. This is almost <i>too</i> good for you.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,Ah! She attacks!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,How surprising. You can actually still maintain yourself.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,You mean your outfit cannot come off? Is it cursed?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Aha! I've caught you in the act!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Can you refute that? Or am I correct?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You're standing your ground? Very well, then so will I!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=confused,Just in case... ~player~, turn around. You needn't see this.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,You know, it would've been smarter to remove the panties first...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Ah, excellent.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=calm,Ah, I see you prefer coattails as well.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Do not feel discouraged, young shinobi. That was a mere trifle, given what we could see.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=shocked,She's been frozen solid! ~Player~, get me Ivaldi! I must thaw her before it is too late!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=confident,Ah! Greetings, newcomer. I am L'Arachel.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=shocked,D-Dark magic! As strong as Grado spells, even!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=confident,How utterly adorable. If we had monsters like these back home, perhaps I'd find a new pastime.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=awkward,Whenever I gaze upon aquatic beasts, I'm reminded of that accursed ghost ship...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,You're going to do another technique?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,We're taking ballista fire! ~player~! Deploy the troops!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Another attack?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:0,direction:down=confident,Fantastic! She has already been disarmed.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Indeed, with so little risk now, I can press onwards without hesitation!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Is it so wrong to enjoy a small, trite victory?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,Do not mind my gaze for the moment. I wish to ascertain how to land my finishing blow.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=shocked,What are you- That's not what you're supposed to do! I shouldn't see your... nethers from the word go!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,No no <i>no</i>! Put that back on right now!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You wouldn't dare! W-Wouldn't you?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,E-Eh? I was wrong?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Haha! Exactly as planned! All of you have just borne witness to the great L'Arachel's masterful strategy!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:twilight,targetStage:6,direction:down=boisterous,At last, things are getting back on track!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=confused,...You did hear, yes? It's your turn.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=calm,Perhaps I will understand more if I watch this.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Most mages are keen on dressing in long, flowing robes.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It's rare to see <i>any</i> mix of colors, much less one so perfect.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Simply absurd. You, divine? I'd sooner believe ~player~ was one.
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,What are...?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Ghh-! I will not stand anymore of your parlor tricks!
-1-opponent_stripping,target:amalia,targetStage:2,test:~background~:street,direction:down=shocked,Wh-Why do you bend over like that? Do you <i>see</i> how many people are back there?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=mad,The lady shall explain herself! What was that loud noise, and why is most of your clothing now missing?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,R-Regardless of what manner of magic you are using, I ask that you desist at once!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,S-Surely you won't be so reckless as to do that again, yes?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh! There it is! And it's not having any mercy now!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:aimee,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,...Did you just... from... I-I can't believe you! I'll see to it you're duely punished for this!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Ah, excellent. You've returned. And removed your hat! That makes things much easier.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:akko,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,What do you mean it's magic? What kind of magic have <i>you</i> been studying?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,It cannot be! You would be the most untrustworthy healer of all time!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Perhaps this is rude to say, but it seems you could use healing with how deathly that skin coloration is.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:beatrix,targetStage:3,direction:down=mad,Honestly... you need to take better care of yourself! Just... shaving doesn't excuse a lack of empathy for the rest of you!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,You actually shaved yourself, here and now? I-I should smack you for doing so when I was not prepared!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:felicia,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,You are not a holy woman! You are a demon, masquerading as one! Yes, I have no choice but to punish your deprived display!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,Seems like such a waste on a helpless lady like yourself.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled,direction:down=happy,Aha! You return! Truly, fortune smiles upon me!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Indeed. Have you considered reclassing?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Regardless, she was one of the most reliable archers I knew. Perhaps you should consider it.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,direction:down=dismissive,And, well, you have more regardless.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps this is the secret of Panic Ploy...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,direction:down=smug,Simple in the end, correct?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:florina,targetStage:7,targetSaidMarker:bee3,direction:down=happy,It's vanquished! Dozla will be so proud of me.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Don't you want to be immortalized? Doing so behind a persona defeats the purpose!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Oh. Just a regular girl. I had perhaps thought there was some reason you had concealed yourself... er, was there?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Y-You're not taking it off all the way? Ingenious...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,W-Well, I suppose that also works. Even if I do not agree with it.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,W-Why not? Oh gods, why must I endure such a depraved heroine?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:gwen,targetStage:6,direction:down=confused,So... I suppose that's in the open now. Much like... your entire body.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:jolyne,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,You have a dangerous aura about you... as if you are possessed by something.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,How are you <i>not</i> a dancer?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:jura,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Do you not realize you are exposing yourself <i>more</i>?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,~Player~, please tell me you have a plan to deal with this... buffoon.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,Do not deny it. My logic is infallible. Isn't that right, ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't forget you only remove one at a time. Perish the thought!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Ugh! You are the absolute <i>worst</i>!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Utterly shameless. But even now, I refuse to fall to your intimidation tactics. I, L'Arachel, shall see you grovel before me!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,You know what else keeps going? Your mouth. The light of Rausten shall overcome this ordeal in the end!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:kyoko,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Such cursed energy... as if the Demon King himself kissed your hands!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Your... gender?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:2,direction:down=smug,Was your world ravaged by foul beasts as well?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Truly captivating! It's everything I hope to be!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4,direction:down=calm,They suited you. Perhaps you have the makings of a legendary hero yourself.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:5,direction:down=embarrassed,It's as if you're wearing a giant sock. Much less heroic.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:6,direction:down=shocked,Is <i>that</i> what undergarments look like in your world? So... immodest!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:7,direction:down=sad,You have my pity, Lucina. You shouldn't have to suffer this indignity!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:8,direction:down=mad,I hope you're happy. Now <i>two</i> undercover princesses have been stripped bare from this game.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Er, wait. That thing on your belt. Was that a weapon? I've never seen anything like it, aside from a toy I had as a child...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,You were just a normal girl? Unbelievable!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Hmmph. I feel cheated.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:4,direction:down=happy,The chance to protect the formerly powerful! Ohoho, L'Arachel, you are a genius!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,Oh my. You still stick to the gauche red-and-black coloration?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:6,direction:down=confident,You could benefit immensely from my tutelage! It'd be an honor to learn from the great L'Arachel.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:7,direction:down=dismissive,Er, did the rest of you not hear? Give the girl some room!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,direction:down=awkward,I... suppose some heroines enjoy the fame that comes with the territory. But this seems like the wrong type of fame!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:marinette,targetStage:8,targetSayingMarker:shibari,direction:down=shocked,O-Oh dear... ~player~, fetch me a dagger! I shall cut down the poor girl myself!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,That is... <i>entirely</i> too much information.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,~Player~, focus! I think we have our target!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,Could it be hypnosis? Conditioning? Or could she have fallen into a despair...?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:4,direction:down=sad,What a tragic fate... and a humiliating one at that!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:5,direction:down=boisterous,The real you is still alive, I am sure! I promise on Rausten's name!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:6,direction:down=sad,This was my fault. This poor, fallen girl...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:moon,targetStage:7,direction:down=happy,She can still be saved. In fact, it might even be easier now that she's in her... preferred state.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:1,direction:down=boisterous,I shall see you slain by the end of the night!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,It appears the moment has passed... however, I highly doubt this is the end of her games.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:3,direction:down=dismissive,Do not delude yourself. I have no interest in the unholy... aside from ridding this fair world of them.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,I-It appears the bats have staved off the worst of it... but be prepared for the next loss!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, you foul demoness... I hope you are prepared to fall at the hands of L'Arachel herself!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:morrigan,targetStage:6,direction:down=dismissive,So instead, I shall wear you down through the end of this game. <i>Then</i> your judgement shall come!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,You needn't remind me. I am not blind, thank you.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:2,direction:down=shocked,By the gods! Did you really change your gender just to keep giving guff?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,I do hope I have made myself clear.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,As you have no doubt determined, I was someone who needed anonymity. I assume yours is a similar tale.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:5,direction:down=calm,That said, I feel rather reassured that you are not such a bad individual.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:6,direction:down=happy,Although, those bindings look remarkably well made. Perhaps if I ever wished to peruse the fighter's lifestyle...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I see how you were able to deceive everyone so easily...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:mulan,targetStage:8,direction:down=confident,While it's commendable, such brashness could get you killed someday. Take heed, friend.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,No matter. L'Arachel will not be so easily impressed, little girl.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,That's impossible, isn't it? I've known you for so long...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:3,direction:down=boisterous,Haha! Be amazed at the overwhelming intellect of L'Arachel!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:5,direction:down=awkward,But I can still see... my eyesight must be even greater than I imagined!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Frankly, that knowledge just makes me feel worse.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:7,direction:down=boisterous,Excellent. I now have the last piece I need to completely finish you!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:natsuki,targetStage:8,direction:down=smug,You're really not helping your case.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,Ah! You were a tiny winged person all along! The creatures of other worlds are fascinating, aren't they ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=embarrassed,Do you not think that is a bad idea in a place like this?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:navi,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Correct, as usual. Truly, my eye is keener than a hawk's.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,Surely she has her reasons... just as I have mine.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,We both have such vibrant green hair! What further proof is needed that I, L'Arachel, have been chosen by the gods themselves?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:3,direction:down=confident,I used to carry around jewelry myself, but I stopped after I started mishandling it. Rennac started working for me around then... strange he never caught the thief.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Er, yes! Of course! I knew that.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,They are meant to come in pairs! Anything else is just wrong!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,Even with so little on, you still look transcendant.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,direction:down=horny,O-Oh... that is definitely the real deal.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:paluselfie,direction:down=awkward,Might I get a chance with Palutena as well? If she doesn't mind...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:palutena,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=sad,Y-You shouldn't hog all of the attention! Leave some for me!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=confused,Compared to the angels of legend, you're rather... disappointing.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It seems even the divine quiver in fear at the mere presence of L'Arachel!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,Wait, sandals? Aren't those unneccessary when you can fly?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,Wha- I thought there was a garment underneath! I-It's rather rude to spring something like this on a girl without giving her time to prepare!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,direction:down=horny,Here I thought you'd be above it all. But even you're temptatious...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitjob,direction:down=awkward,Er, why did you do that, Mahiru? I always thought touching there was taboo, but maybe since it's an angel?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:mahiru,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:pitpaluselfie,direction:down=mad,Hey! The divine should be gathering around <i>me</i>!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:pit,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:natko_neutral,direction:down=awkward,Those two should be ashamed of themselves. Lusting after an angel...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Attendants are really the best, aren't they? They make the simple tasks so much more bearable, which leaves more time for the heavy stuff!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,For all your bluster, there's hardly any substance to back it up! At this rate, you're practically out already!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,Wait, you're <i>both</i> nude? I thought she wasn't playing!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,You are a mage as well, then?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=mad,Nggh-! How dare she talk down at me so! <i>Me!</i>
-1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Alcohol. How crass. I ask that you keep that <i>far</i> away from me.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smug,Oh, Sakuya! How would you feel serving a heroine? I may have a position open with your name on it.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,Oh, please. If there was <i>anyone</i> worthy enough to impress a woman such as you, I have surpassed them one hundred times over.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,Perhaps I was mistaken... were you an enemy all along?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Very well. The result is the same in the end.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,I can see you getting along with Dozla. You are both too earnest for your own good.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:3,direction:down=happy,Just consider it. You would be quite the asset.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=shocked,W-What? Rinkah, your bottoms appear to be several sizes too small! They're hardly undergarments!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,direction:down=sad,And despite that, you did well to keep them for so long.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:WillShowButt,direction:down=mad,D-Do not shake your rear at me! I should smack you for that.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:rinkah,targetStage:6,direction:down=embarrassed,I refuse to look. Even if we share anatomy, I will not partake in this!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:1,direction:down=smug,We're going to be the triumphant duo here. Isn't that right, ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dismissive,Oops. Too late now.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:3,direction:down=confused,And now you look like a wicked fairy tail villain. Hmm. This should be interesting...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Oh... does she need a heal?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:5,direction:down=shocked,The real villain here was your uniform? What a twist! Not even <i>I</i> could have seen that coming!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:ryuko,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,I am not surprised you would be forced to shave. Poor thing, under that demonic outfit's influence...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Were you in Magvel, you'd be given a far skimpier outfit. I personally don't agree with it, but it <i>is</i> tradition.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,You had my curiosity, but now you have my suspicion...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:3,direction:down=shocked,M-Monster! Villainous deceptor! How dare you try and make me drop my guard!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:4,direction:down=mad,Hmmph. You survive even now? Fine! See what I care!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:5,direction:down=smug,But alas for you. Fate put you on the same playing field as L'Arachel herself.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:6,direction:down=awkward,I knew it was only a matter of time before you revealed your bloodthirsty tendencies. I can no longer be merciful.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sakura,targetStage:7,direction:down=awkward,N-Not that I wanted to look. Point being, you're more clever than your average monster, I'll give you that. Hence why I must beat you.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=awkward,I-I knew it was a lie. I cannot afford to drop my guard for even a moment...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=confident,It's common knowledge that magic is drawn from tomes and staves. Indeed, you seem to be an imposter, and naught more.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,No matter. Whether or not you <i>are</i> a witch, the next round shall punish you plenty.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=embarrassed,There really <i>are</i> things you should warn us of beforehand!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Ah, the powers that be come through for me once more. Excellent. Er, wait...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=mad,D-Do not look at me with such a coy look! She could have covered herself with the cape, could she have not?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sayaka,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,N-Not excellent, per se, but... you understand what I mean.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=awkward,Although you seem quite a bit more exposed... was it magical?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,...~Player~, I ask that you question Rennac once we are through here. He might have made some... questionable choices.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=confident,Y-Yes! My intuition was correct, as usual. I knew you were a Summoner!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:sheena,targetStage:6,direction:down=smug,Oh! It appears you require yet more training. You seem to have also disposed of your underwear with that technique...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1,direction:down=confident,Oh... only Shimakaze took a hit. Excellent strategy! I knew you were reliable!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2,direction:down=confused,Very strange... whoever this assailant is seems to only be targeting Shimakaze. How mysterious...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:1,direction:down=happy,The mission is going swimmingly, don't you agree?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Ah, you wear so little! It seems you will be a simple foe to conquer in the end...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:3,direction:down=calm,It would appear you died before you could hit your growth spurt. But that matters little- I shall ensure there is a peaceful end for you.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:spooky,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,A-Although, I suppose that answers the question in the back of my mind that asked whether or not ghosts could still grow hair...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:1,direction:down=dismissive,Hmph. Is this how you treat total strangers? You could make do with a lesson in courtesy.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:2,direction:down=awkward,Might you at least close your blouse? Your cleavage is distracting, to say the least.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:3,direction:down=embarrassed,As much as it pains the champion within me, I must admit that you are perhaps beyond saving.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:4,direction:down=confident,So you are capable! It seems all I had to do was state the opposite of the logical choice.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:5,direction:down=happy,Now that I've discovered the secret, this is <i>much</i> more fun!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:twilight,targetStage:7,direction:down=embarrassed,And now you're just... exposed. It's quite bittersweet.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=shocked,B-Butterflies? And where'd your hat go? I deman answers!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=happy,Aha! I am correct! You are certainly a mage!
-1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:3,direction:down=smug,And yet you dress in garb that could pass as underwear.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=awkward,Your condescension is... unappreciated.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=mad,Count your blessings. Were I not the superior woman, I would whack you for that one.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=horny,At the very least, use the butterflies as cover or what have you...
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=interested,Are you ensnared, Gwendolyne? Perhaps you could use a hand from me?
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:marinette,direction:down=awkward,Is... that your catch phrase? It could use some work.
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=calm,I guarantee we'll be able to find the source of this. ...No?
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:morrigan,direction:down=embarrassed,What is she doing...? ~Player~, slap me! I need to remain focused!
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=horny,She didn't back down... how honorable...
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=shocked,C-Come again? You're going to <i>fight</i>?
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:ryuko,direction:down=confident,Such loyalty! Take notes, ~player~.
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:sakura,direction:down=boisterous,Try as you might, L'Arachel will <i>always</i> weed out the demons of the world!
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:florina,priority:0,direction:down=happy,I admit, this song is quite pretty. A shame it's wasted on a subject like pegasi...
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:natsuki,priority:0,direction:down=mad,(Seriously, how does she know ~player~? What is being hid from me?)
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:palutena,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Forgive me for the sin of watching, Palutena...
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:pit,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,D-Don't you dare look at me! Not even angels can be an exception.
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=shocked,St-Stay away from me when you fight!
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,Do other people do things like this for amusement? Fun?
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=horny,I don't suppose I could convince you to clothe yourself now that you're dueling?
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=confused,At least this isn't particularly violent. No weapons are involved... other than their considerable figures.
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,priority:0,direction:down=mad,How can the rest of you just stand there and watch? You should be stopping them! ...No?
-1-opponent_masturbating,target:remilia,priority:0,direction:down=awkward,The capability of flight makes me wonder if perhaps... she is a monster herself...
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:9s,direction:down=confident,Well well! At least <i>you</i> appear to have had the decency to hold back.
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:gwen,direction:down=happy,Ah, she freed herself. Marvelous! Another fine job by me... hey, I helped! Shush!
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:kamina,direction:down=smug,You missed. Twice.
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:moon,direction:down=dismissive,I didn't want to resort to this, but I think we have no choice. ~Player~, fetch some rope before the game ends, if you'd please.
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:palutena,direction:down=awkward,N-No, I didn't enjoy that. Stop saying such blasphemous things...
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:pit,direction:down=horny,You just... while I'm like this...
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,direction:down=horny,N-No more of that violence, or so help me...
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:remilia,direction:down=mad,Coward! Face the light of Rausten like you deserve!




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

female_must_masturbate,direction:down=interested,Another player has been defeated? Alas, I suppose such is the reality of this game.
female_must_masturbate,direction:down=happy,Take heart! Lose with grace, for you could not have bested L'Arachel.
female_must_masturbate,direction:down=horny,J-just one step closer to the conclusion of this <i>vile pastime</i>. T-take your time; don't hurt yourself on my account.
female_start_masturbating,direction:down=confused,Y-yes, I... I suppose you <i>are</i> simply doing as you're supposed to...
female_start_masturbating,direction:down=horny,I hope you enjoy yourself, for I... <i>certainly</i> won't be enjoying this.
female_start_masturbating,direction:down=smug,Did you expect to be commended for your zeal? In this? <i>Ha!</i>
female_masturbating,direction:down=confident,Ha! Calm as ever, right ~player~? I truly <i>am</i> quite the princess.
female_masturbating,direction:down=calm,To delight in victory so little as I have... you are indeed fortunate to have me!
female_masturbating,direction:down=dismissive,You should guard your mind well. You are quite... impressionable in this state.
female_masturbating,direction:down=embarrassed,Mind your gaze! Shield your mind!
female_masturbating,direction:down=awkward,You know, you need not do this so... <i>intently</i>.
female_masturbating,direction:down=horny,<i>Mmh...</i> W-well, I s-suppose... your effort is admirable...
female_masturbating,direction:down=mad,Honestly, if you're going to lose, can't you do so <i>peacefully?</i>
female_finished_masturbating,direction:down=awkward,What a shameful pastime, indeed. And... it seems <i>some</i> of those present enjoyed it...
female_finished_masturbating,direction:down=sad,<i>O-oh! Erm...</i> I suddenly feel rather... ~player~, I will be needing to bathe, sooner rather than later.
female_finished_masturbating,direction:down=shocked,Gods! You must truly need my intervention!

#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.

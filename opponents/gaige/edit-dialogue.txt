#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

0-game_start,count-gaige:2-4=happy.png,I'm flattered, ~player~! You have to go out of your way to have more than one of the same character at a table, so I'm touched you did that to have more of me!

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=calm.png,Gimme ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm.png,Lemme have ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm.png,I need ~cards~.
swap_cards=thinking.png,Hmm... Guess I'll trade ~cards~.
swap_cards=thinking.png,Eh... ~cards~ should work.
okay_hand=thinking.png,What're the odds that I'll lose with this hand...?
okay_hand=calm.png,Just a pair?... Eh, I'm sure I'll be fine!
okay_hand=calm.png,Eh, I've gotten by with less before.
okay_hand=claptrap.png,Starting to wish I brought some snacks...
okay_hand=calm.png,This... is a hand alright.
bad_hand=sad.png,Aw, this hand is <i>junk</i>!
bad_hand=sad.png,... Wait, maybe if I... nope, still bad.
bad_hand=thinking.png,Hmm... I wonder if I can fit a card loader in Deathtrap...
bad_hand=sad.png,No amount of Discord will fix <i>this</i>...
bad_hand=thinking.png,Normally, duct tape can fix anything, but <i>this</i>?... Unless...
bad_hand=claptrap.png,Yep, this hand blows chunks.

-3-hand,count-role;other&character;tomoko&stage;7-8&sayingmarker;gaige_sexysexthing:,id:33=claptrap.png,You mean like with another person...? 'Cause I've never done any of that stuff. No one at my school liked me enough for it, and then I became a Vault Hunter and got super busy...

-3-hand,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;1:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;Meia_ECHO:,marker:Meia_ECHO=happy.png,Well yeah, that's why eye pieces sucked. ECHOs are handheld devices, and they give you everything you'd need in one little package!

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;dust&stage;0-6&sayingmarker;gaige-blacksmith:=wink.png,Because we both make awesome weapons, right? Or maybe this blacksmith is also a hot redhead? Either way, I'll take that as a compliment!

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;Gaige2:,marker:Mary_TrippleEntendre=wink.png,Don't forget about "gauge" earrings, which are commonly associated with punk fashion. One could describe my style as "punk," so it's actually a <i>triple</i> entendre.

0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;mary&sayingmarker;Gaige1:=happy.png,I'm into both, actually. Robots require a fair deal of software to get going. They can't do anything until you teach them how to, you know?
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;nami:=happy.png,Nah, don't worry about it. My arm's not the worst reason someone's had for staring at me.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;tomoko&stage;0-8:=happy.png,Oh, you don't know? It's basically a system of government where there is no government! Having no rules rules!

0-stripping,count-role;other&character;tomoko&stage;0-8:=stripping.png,Well yeah, pretty much. I mean, in a system where the only people you need around are people you <i>want</i> around, popularity's pretty important.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,Well, I didn't exactly <i>lose</i> it. I cut it off after I got a really cool idea!

1-stripped=stripped.png,I've got several important things hanging from that, so that should count for a lot.
1-stripped=stripped.png,My shield, my hammer, <i>and</i> my class mod hang from that, so that'd better count for a lot.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;nami:=happy.png,Deathtrap's my killer robot! It's okay though, I got most of the bugs fixed, so he shouldn't attack you unless I tell him to!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=happy.png,Oh, sorry, <i>I said I cut it off!</i> This way, I can summon Deathtrap wherever and whenever I want!
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;tomoko&stage;0-8:=thinking.png,Well that and the ability to blow the faces off of people who pose a threat to you.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;pit:=stripped.png,Well, I've got my shield, my hammer, <i>and</i> class mod hanging from that, along with some decorations. So yeah, you should be grateful that I took them off in one go.
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;0-5:=thinking.png,Y'know, I think "bounty hunter" is pretty apt. Except I think all of us Vault Hunters have bounties on our heads ourselves.

1-stripped,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_lifeBonus&sayingmarker;gaige_more:=happy.png,Oh yeah, I got a bunch! One gives me more assault rifle damage, one gives me a bonus to accuracy and reload speed, and so on. It's good to have options!
1-stripped,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_lifeBonus&sayingmarker;gaige_lifeBonus2:=thinking.png,Uh... Well, it gives me a bonus to gun damage, and shooting people is what I do. Is that what you mean?
1-stripped,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&var;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_smarter&sayingmarker;gaige_dontUnderstand:=wink.png,Well thanks, ~other~, and don't worry, I can explain what you didn't understand later.
1-stripped,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_inTheBox&sayingmarker;gaige_smallBox:=happy.png,You'd be surprised how compact technology has become! I mean, I can fit Deathtrap inside of my arm!

1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;megumin&sayingmarker;megumin_gaige_construction:,marker:Megumin_FixUp=calm.png,Er, well, kinda? I mostly build robots and stuff, but sometimes I help fix up buildings around Sanctuary since I know how to weld.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;gaige_metalArm:=happy.png,Heh, well first, I cut it off with a particle saw, and then I built a robotic one! In hindsight, I should've reversed my order of operations...
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;tomoko&stage;0-8:=thinking.png,Hmm. I mean, maybe? You ever shoot a guy or blow anything up?
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;jessie:=thinking.png,Huh, well, I guess Pandora kinda is one big junkyard, but no, I'm a Vault Hunter.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;megumin&sayingmarker;megumin_gaige_class:,marker:Megumin_Anarchist=calm.png,I'm an Anarchist class Mechromancer, but I've been thinking of swtiching to a Roboteer instead.
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;pit:=happy.png,Nah, not really. I got a cool idea, I cut off my arm, and then I built this replacement! Not much of a story there!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;0-5:,id:44=happy.png,Oh, see, I cut it off when I got an idea for my latest project! Not only can I punch through concrete now, but I can also digistruct my bot Deathtrap anytime I want!
1-must_strip,count-role;other&character;yuelia&sayingmarker;gaige_bandage:=happy.png,Oh, yeah, just a little workshop accident. Piece of metal flew up and hit my face. No biggie.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Time for another mediocre pick: my vest.
1-stripping=stripping.png,Guess I'll take off my vest next. Don't fall asleep on me!
1-stripping=stripping.png,Yeah yeah, "vests are boring," but I gotta take it off to get to my shirt anyway, so shut up!
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;tomoko&stage;0-8:=stripping.png,Actually, wait, better question, how good are you at doing what you want and taking what you want? That's more important.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,Yeah, like bank vaults, except way bigger and way more ancient. Some say they contain tons of riches!
1-stripping,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_metalArm&sayingmarker;gaige_armReplace:=stripping.png,Nah, no problems at all! In fact, this is way better, 'cause I can digistruct claws and punch through concrete! It's so badass!
1-stripping,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_bandage&sayingmarker;gaige_metalHow:=stripping.png,Oh, you know, typical metal shop accident. The kind of thing that safety goggles were designed for.
1-stripping,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_metalArm&sayingmarker;gaige_armProblem:=stripping.png,Well, I did accidentally slice halfway through my arm with some sheet metal, but that could've been fixed with some Insta-Health.
1-stripping,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_bandage&sayingmarker;gaige_workplace:=stripping.png,Well, I don't exactly "work" anywhere. At least, not in the sense of having a job. I do metalwork around Sanctuary, though.
1-stripping,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_metalArm&sayingmarker;gaige_armWhy:=stripping.png,Well, I was trying to figure out a good way to quickly summon Deathtrap, and then I got the idea to cut my arm off and store his digistruct data in it so I can summon him anytime!

2-stripped,priority:101,count-role;other&character;yuelia&saidmarker;gaige_metalHow:=stripped.png,I mean yeah, these are the kinds of risks you take in shop. Haven't you ever heard of people losing fingers on saws and stuff? It happens.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Wow! You work out?
male_chest_is_visible=wink.png,That's a great chest - and trust me, I know a thing or two about chests! I open 'em all the time!
male_chest_is_visible=wink.png,Nice glutes!... Wait, crap, those're in <i>hips</i>, not <i>chests</i>...
male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Let's open it up and see what pops out!... Did that loot inuendo land...?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

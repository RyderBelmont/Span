            Event Dates:
            Events can be configured to automatically begin and end on certain dates by adding
            the <dates> element.

            The <dates> element can contain <date> elements that specify each scheduled date
            range that the event will activate on.
            Multiple date ranges can be specified (for example, for events that change dates across different years).

            Events without any <dates> listed can only be activated manually, by editing
            config.xml and/or prod-config.xml.
        -->
        <dates>
            <date>
                <!-- 
                    The <from> and <to> elements specify the start and end dates of the event, respectively.
                    The month and day must both be specified.

                    The year is optional; if the year is omitted, the event is assumed to repeat every year
                    at the same month and day.
                    
                    Events begin and end at midnight UTC, and the end date itself is included as part of the date range.

                    This particular event is scheduled every year, lasting the entire month of August.

                    The end date of an event can also be omitted; the event is then assumed to last for exactly
                    one day.
                -->
                <from month="8" day="1" />
                <to month="8" day="31" />
            </date>

            <date override="true">
                <!-- 
                    Repeating date ranges and year-specific date ranges aren't mutually exclusive.
                    For example, a "rerun" of an event outside of the usual repeating dates can be scheduled
                    by adding another, one-shot date range with years specified.

                    Additionally, adding `override="true"` to a date range will cause that date range
                    to override other date ranges for that year.

                    To be specific: when a date range is marked as an override, it will take priority
                    over all other date ranges for that year (and that year only).
                    Other date ranges not marked as overrides will not be checked during years where
                    overrides are scheduled.

                    Multiple override ranges can be listed (either for different years, or for the same year).

                    This can be used to reschedule, shorten, or lengthen an event during a particular year.

                    This override, for example, shortens the 2022 Summer Event to only last two weeks,
                    instead of the entire month.
                -->
                <from month="8" day="1" />
                <to month="8" day="14" />
            </date>

            <date override="true">
                <!-- This particular override reschedules the 2023 Summer Event to July, instead of August. -->
                <from month="7" day="1" />
                <to month="7" day="31" />

            This specifies a default background to use during the event.
            Only one default background can be specified per event.

            Note that if two or more different events happen to overlap in time, then the game will randomly
            choose a default background from one of the overlapping events upon each startup.

            This specifies a list of (possibly multiple) costume sets to enable during the event.
            Specifying "all" will enable all costume sets during the event.
            
            Characters who have event costumes from these sets will automatically wear them by default.
            
            Characters with multiple event costumes from the same set (or who have multiple enabled costumes due to overlapping events)
            will randomly select one to use by default when the game is loaded.

            Characters with event costumes will also be shifted to the top of the roster by default
            during events (using a special Event sorting mode), and will also be available as
            random prefill characters.

        <!--
            This specifies a list of (possibly multiple) character tags to highlight during the event.

            Characters with these tags will be moved higher in the roster (below characters with event costumes,
            but above everyone else) when using the Event sorting mode, and will also be available as
            random prefill characters.

            Note that this feature only looks at base character tags: since tags from alternate costumes
            aren't loaded until the character themselves is selected and fully loaded, these filters
            cannot highlight tags that are listed as part of character alternate costumes.

            (To be specific, you can only filter against tags that work in the selection screen search menu.
            This excludes tags from alternate costumes as well as tags that are added via dialogue cases.)

            This specifies a list of candy images to use during the event.
            Each <path> element should contain a relative path to an image from the `opponents/` folder,
            like the candy image paths found in `spniTitle.js`.

            These images will completely replace the default candy images during the event.
            However, if no candy images are specified for an event, then the default images will be used instead.

            If multiple overlapping events are active, all of their candy images will be combined
            into a single large pool of images to randomly draw from.
